  "context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- It couldn't top its predecessors, but \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" still brought in quite a haul, grossing an estimated $87 million for the opening weekend of the summer movie season.\n\n\n\nHugh Jackman stars as the title character in \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\"\n\n\n\nThe Hugh Jackman pic brought in a strong $21,225 per-theater average in 4,099 movie houses, despite generating mixed reviews. The film fell $15 million short of 2006's \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" but it is still an enormous success for Jackman and director Gavin Hood.\n\n\n\nMatthew McConaughey's \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\" generated an estimated $15.3 million for a second place bow.\n\n\n\nIt's not a shabby opening but it is far less than McConaughey's previous romantic outings including last year's \"Fool's Gold\" ($21.6 million) or 2006's \"Failure to Launch\" ($24.2 million). (Perhaps women were too busy checking out all those hunky mutants this weekend?) The two new openers did help the industry maintain its year-over-year increase of 16 percent.\n\n\n\nAlso aiding that statistic was Beyonce Knowles' \"Obsessed.\" Dropping a not-surprising 57 percent for its second weekend in theaters, the thriller earned another $12.2 million to put its ten-day gross at a shockingly strong $47 million.\n\n\n\nAnd Zac Efron's \"17 Again\" showed surprising stamina, too, grossing an additional $6.3 million its third weekend for a total take of $48.4 million.\n\n\n\nThe other new wide release for the weekend was the anemic 3-D animated sci-fi film \"Battle for Terra.\" Opening on 1162 theaters, the Justin Long, Evan Rachel Wood-voiced feature proved to be little competition for the other 3-D movie in the marketplace.\n\n\n\nDreamworks Animation's juggernaut \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" grossed another $5.8 million its sixth weekend for the fifth slot in the rankings, while newcomer \"Terra\" couldn't muster more than $1 million for a twelfth place in the box office derby.\n\n\n\nSummer has officially begun -- at least in Hollywood -- so expect a giant event film every weekend. Wolverine may have bowed mightily but with \"Star Trek\" hot on its heels next weekend, the Marvel superhero is going to need more than adamantium to maintain its box office lead.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Shortly after midnight on January 24, a 16-year old boy from Powder Springs, Georgia, crashed his car into an oncoming vehicle. Garrett Reed, a star football player at Harrison High School, died instantly. Police believe he had been drinking.\n\n\n\nKecia Evangela Whitfield, 43, is charged with furnishing alcohol to a minor and reckless conduct.\n\n\n\nAccording to police, the investigation revealed that a classmate's mother served alcohol to Reed. Police charged 43-year-old Kecia Evangela Whitfield with furnishing alcohol to a minor and reckless conduct, both misdemeanors.\n\n\n\nWhitfield was released on a $10,000 bond and awaits a court date in April. Records on file with the Cobb County solicitor general's office indictate she has not yet entered a plea or obtained a lawyer. She did not return CNN's phone calls.\n\n\n\nIf convicted, she could receive up to a year in jail and fines totaling thousands of dollars.\n\n\n\nToxicology reports for Reed will be released in six weeks, officials said. His death stunned the small community of Powder Springs and sounded an alarm for parents.\n\n\n\n\"What we have to realize is that our kids do think they are invincible,\" said Patti Agatston, a mother of another Harrison High School teenager who lives in Reed's neighborhood. \"We can't be enablers. We've got to be adults and say 'no.' \"\n\n\n\nAt least ten states including Virginia, Minnesota and New Mexico-and Georgia, where Garrett's accident occurred, allow parents to give their own child alcohol, according to the Alcohol Policy Information System, a federal website that tracks alcohol laws.\n\n\n\nThe alcohol can typically be given to the minor in the guardian's home or a private setting and there are no age limits, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, nowhere is it legal to give alcohol to other people's children.\n\n\n\nOfficials say teen binge drinking is reaching epidemic proportions, and states and municipalities are scrambling to implement \"social hosting\" laws that carry stiff fines for parents whose homes are used for drinking parties, whether they know about them or not.\n\n\n\nAt least 24 states have enacted social hosting laws that fine parents several thousand dollars for each offense, said Jim Mosher, an expert tracking alcohol policies at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The fines, he said, are an effective deterrent.\n\n\n\nA 2005 study conducted by the American Medical Association reported that about one-third of teens said it was \"easy to obtain alcohol\" from their parents. That figure jumps to 40 percent when it comes to getting alcohol from a friend's parent. One out of four teens said they had attended a party where minors were drinking in front of parents.\n\n\n\nSome communities are using their zoning powers to create local social hosting laws. These laws usually result in misdemeanor charges and jail time is rare. Prosecutors' offices are often busy with other cases and don't bother to charge unless there is a serious incident or accident, policy experts said.\n\n\n\n\"It's very difficult for us to knock on a random door and say 'are you drinking?' \" said Sgt. Dana Pierce of the Cobb County Police Department, the agency responsible for investigating Reed's case. \"We usually have to respond to some kind of nuisance call.\"\n\n\n\nIn Massachusetts in January, a court sentenced a mother to jail for serving alcohol to minors at a party in her home. A teenage boy died in an auto accident after leaving her party. In Charlottesville, Virginia, two adults served jail time in 2007 for providing alcohol at their son's 16th birthday party.\n\n\n\nSome parents consider giving a teenager a drink a rite of passage -- and that contributes to high teenage drinking rates, said Richard Yoast, director of the Department of Healthy Lifestyles and Primary Prevention at the American Medical Association. \"It's a myth that adults and children are buying into, and it creates pressure on the child to drink,\" Yoast said.\n\n\n\n\"The biggest problem to overcome is the fact that parents feel like they are helping their kids,\" said Denise Thames, director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Georgia, \"They often forget they are in fact breaking the law.\"\n\n\n\nThe affluent suburbs near Powder Springs, where Reed's accident took place, are not immune. Police say there were several teenagers hanging out with Reed the night he died, including Whitfield's stepson.\n\n\n\nSeveral of Reed's close friends at Harrison High School said alcohol is easy to get in their community and students can find a drinking party each weekend if they want to. It is easier to get alcohol from older friends and relatives or parents than buying it with a fake ID, they said.\n\n\n\n\"As long as you have money, you can get it,\" said Eric Stallworth, a senior at Harrison High School, who was close friends with Reed. He described his friend as a charismatic and popular boy, who was fiercely competitive when it came to sports and dreamed of playing college football.\n\n\n\nWhile there is no county or city ordinance on social hosting in Powder Springs, or in Georgia, some parents are fighting back.\n\n\n\nThe Cobb Alcohol Task Force, which also serves Powder Springs, is a volunteer group working to reduce teens' access to alcohol. The group launched a campaign called \"Adults Who Host Lose the Most\" to educate the public about the dangers of illegally providing teens with liquor.\n\n\n\nSurveys in Cobb County show the campaigns are working slowly, said Cathy Finck, Cobb Alcohol Task Force coordinator. In 2007, 68 percent of 10th grade students said obtaining alcohol was easy, a decrease from 73 percent the previous year.\n\n\n\nBut that may not be enough to stop a fatal accident such as Reed's.\n\n\n\n\"Unless you get everyone to do it, kids will find out one place where they can get alcohol and you will have these kinds of incidences,\" Finck said. \"Everyone has to get on board.\"\n\n\n\nUltimately, parents need to step up and take responsibility, said Shawna Snapp of Blue River, Oregon. Her son, Ryan Snapp, nicknamed \"Snapper,\" died two years ago in a car accident. He was 17 and the teenage driver had been drinking alcohol obtained from an adult.\n\n\n\n\"We're not here as parents to be their best friends,\" Snapp said. \"We are here to guide them for life.\"",

The kidnapping prompted LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand.\n\n\n\n\"There are no leaders here, or we are all leaders,\" LeBaron's brother Julian LeBaron told CNN affiliate KINT-TV in El Paso, Texas, this week. \"If they kill my brother, another three will take his place.

Jay-Z's wife, singer Beyonce Knowles, was perhaps the most embarrassed by his outburst.\n\n\n\nSwift, a 19-year-old country-pop singer, was in the midst of her acceptance speech for the Best Female Video award when West rushed onstage and took her microphone. He then let loose an outburst on behalf of Beyonce, who was one of several artists who lost out to Swift.\n\n\n\nAlthough Beyonce appeared stunned as she watched from the front row, she gracefully recovered near the end of the show, when she was onstage to accept an award of her own.\n\n\n\n\"I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV award with Destiny's Child, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life,\" she said, referring to the girl group with which she had her start. \"So I would like for Taylor to come out and have her moment.\"\n\n\n\nWest's online apology appeared soon after.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sooooo sorry to Taylor Swift and her fans and her mom,\" the message said in all caps. \"I spoke to her mother right after and she said the same thing my mother would've said. She is very talented! ... I'm in the wrong for going on stage and taking away from her moment!\"\n\n\n\nMTV said the West-Swift incident was not planned, a point it had to stress after a walkout by singer Eminem at last year's event turned out to be staged.\n\n\n\nStaged or not, apologies from celebrities behaving badly have been good for Leno's ratings.\n\n\n\nWhen Grant told Leno \"I did a bad thing,\" it gave Leno's \"Tonight Show\" a viewership bump that has been credited with solidifying his lead over rival David Letterman in the late-night ratings war.\n\n\n\nThis is just the kind of \"immediacy\" Leno was talking about in a call with reporters last week.\n\n\n\n\"The idea here is that we'll tape a new, fresh show every single day, talking about the events that happened that day that night,\" Leno said.\n\n\n\nWest, Rihanna and Jay-Z will debut Leno's new approach to musical guests. They will be limited to one song, and most nights they'll share the stage with other stars.\n\n\n\n\"What we're trying to do is put together acts that you don't normally see together or don't normally perform together,\" Leno said.\n\n\n\nJerry Seinfeld will also appear on Leno's premiere Monday.",

Gary Bowling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe police must \"assume abduction,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the answers to why you'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly,\" Bowling said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice have no official suspects, but are treating everyone they interview as one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the world's a suspect\" now, Bowling said.   Hear the frantic 911 call \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nA nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear. Police plan to use infrared aviation technology after dark Wednesday in their search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's a 5-year-old child, and she's afraid of the dark,\" Bowling said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday night, Ronald Cummings' girlfriend, 17-year-old Misty Croslin, was watching Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCroslin put Haleigh to bed at 8 p.m. and then went to bed herself at 10 p.m., they said.  Croslin told police she woke up at 3 a.m. and discovered Haleigh missing. Croslin then called 911 and told a dispatcher that she found a brick on the floor of the family's double-wide trailer, according to CNN affiliate WJXT-TV.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe station's Web site printed the text of the 911 call, which included this exchange:\n\n\n\n\n\nDispatch: OK. All right, you said your back door was wide open?\n\n\n\n\n\nCaller: Yes, with a brick. Like, there was a brick on the floor. Like, when I went to sleep the door was not like that.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brick was actually holding open the door to the trailer, Putnam County Sheriff's Office Lt. Johnny Greenwood told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nCroslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues, said Bowling, describing the girlfriend as a \"child herself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Cummings pleaded for his daughter's safe return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All I want is my child ... please ... all I want is my child,\" he said, his voice breaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Haleigh's maternal grandmother, Marie Griffis, told reporters that she feared the worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's out there somewhere, I can feel her. I can feel her presence,\" Griffis told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV. \"She's screaming.\"  Watch grandparents plead for girl's return \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nHaleigh's mother, Crystal Sheffield, wept as she stood in front of reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want whoever's got her to bring her home,\" the girl's mother said. \"That's all I want, is my baby home.\"  Watch mother's tearful plea \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a \"rocky relationship\" and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter. Sheffield lives near the Florida-Georgia line and has been interviewed by law enforcement, according to police.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators are looking into various angles of the case, including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home, Greenwood said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough that number may sound high, it includes both Putnam and Palatka counties, which are separated by the St. Johns River, the law enforcement spokesman told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice are offering but not requiring all those interviewed in the case to take polygraph tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone with any information is encouraged to call the Putnam County Sheriff's Office at 386-329-0800 or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse at 888-FL-MISSING.",

A transcript of the entire conversation was promptly posted online by the Mexican government. Hernandez is also reaching out to fans through Twitter, where he posts updates under the name \"@Astro--Jose.\"\n\n\n\n\"I come from a very humble family and what I would call a typical migrant farm working family,\" Hernandez said in a NASA interview.\n\n\n\nAs a child, Hernandez's family split their time between Mexico and California, where they worked as migrant farm workers.\n\n\n\nDuring the school year his parents emphasized his education, but on the weekends Hernandez would help the family, he said in the interview, posted on the NASA Web site.\n\n\n\nGrowing up in Stockton, California, it was Hernandez's job as the youngest child to hold up the rabbit ear antennas on the family's television set in order to get the best reception while everyone watched the Apollo missions.\n\n\n\n\"Now I kid around with my family saying that, you know, it was through osmosis that I became an astronaut because I was closest to the whole situation,\" Hernandez told NASA.\n\n\n\nThe real catalyst for his dream to become an astronaut, however, came when Franklin Chang-Diaz, became the first Latin American astronaut in 1981.\n\n\n\n\"There was a lot of parallels and that's when I challenged myself. I said, \"Hey, if Franklin can do it, why can't I do it?\" Hernandez said in the interview.\n\n\n\nHernandez earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering, and before joining NASA worked on a number of high-tech projects, including an X-ray laser to be deployed in space, a digital mammography system and the disposal of excess nuclear material in Russia, his official biography states.\n\n\n\nAccording to NASA, there are nine Hispanics currently in the astronaut program, and 13 total in the program's history. Astronaut Danny Olivas, also of Mexican descent, will also fly on Discovery's upcoming 13-day mission.\n\n\n\nThe scheduled launch of Discovery on Tuesday was scrubbed twice, once because of weather and then hours later because of of mechanical issues involving a drain valve. NASA did not announce a new launch schedule.",

  "context": "MANAMA, Bahrain (CNN) -- Efforts to protect ships from pirates in the waters off Somalia's east coast face a tremendous challenge: The vastness of the area makes it difficult to get to ships that are in danger.\n\nThe crew of the Maersk Alabama talked with media after the ship docked in Mombasa, Kenya.\n\n\"To put it in perspective, draw a box from Houston to Chicago to New York City down to Jacksonville, Florida. It's an immense body of water,\" U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters Sunday.\n\nWhen the Maersk Alabama, a U.S.-flagged cargo ship, reported an attempted attack by pirates the day before the pirates successful attempt on Wednesday, \"our closest vessel from all the navies that were out there -- we have 16 navies that are patrolling those waters -- and the closest one was the USS Bainbridge, and it was over 300 nautical miles,\" Gortney said.\n\nThe next day, when the Maersk company reported pirates had boarded its ship, \"we were closing Bainbridge as quickly as we [could], but 22 knots, 300 miles, it takes a while to get there.\"  View a timeline of the attack and its aftermath \u00bb\n\nHe added, \"There's about a 10-minute window from when the pirates are able to get onboard that we have time to act.\"\n\nThings are different on the north side of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden, where many piracy incidents have taken place. That area is \"a little bit more concentrated,\" Gortney said, speaking from Bahrain.\n\n\"We've had more successful attempts\" at breaking up piracy efforts in that region, he said. \"But out on the east coast of Somalia, such a vast area, we simply do not have enough resources in order to cover all those areas.\"\n\nGortney spoke to reporters by telephone Sunday after Navy snipers shot and killed three pirates who had held Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips hostage since Wednesday. Phillips was freed by the U.S. Navy uninjured.  Watch how U.S. forces believed Phillips was in danger \u00bb\n\nPhillips graduated from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, which trains mariners on the dangers of piracy, the president of the academy said.\n\n\"The sea is a dangerous place -- pirates [are] just one of the many dangers,\" Adm. Rick Gurnon of the academy told reporters after the rescue. The academy \"tries to educate you and prepare you to keep you from danger, but it doesn't always work.\"\n\nHe noted that while Phillips' story had a happy ending, more than 200 mariners remain captives at sea, and called on the international community to beef up security in the waters by arming crews, increasing warships and reducing the ability of Somalis to obtain ships from coastal safehavens.\n\n\"It will certainly take hard work and money and focus,\" he said, \"but we've got to stop it or we begin to risk lives in areas of the world that are vital for national security.\"\n\nChris Voss, former FBI international kidnapping negotiator, told CNN that the pirates from the impoverished, war-torn nation need an alternative way to make money.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they found themselves in a position where they could start piracy in the region and it's become a virus,\" Voss told CNN. \"It's easy money ... and once it gets into a culture, it's very difficult to get out, and the only way to get it out is attack on multiple levels.\"\n\nAsked whether he was concerned that this incident, including the deaths of three of the four pirates involved in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of Phillips, could escalate violence in the region, Gortney responded, \"Yes ... This could escalate violence in this part of the world. No question about it.\"\n\nBut some experts believe the rescue may help set a tone that will eventually deter piracy in the region.\n\n\"This one incident, if it is the only time that we take this robust action, will not deter,\" retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN. \"But this incident, the next incident, the next incident after that -- a long term pattern will certainly have a deterrent effect against piracy.\"",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The romantic comedy \"New In Town\" puts co-stars Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. at odds through most of the film. But behind the camera, the story was completely different, the pair told CNN.\n\nHarry Connick Jr. and Renee Zellweger enjoyed working with one another on the set of \"New In Town.\"\n\n\"I had a great time. [Connick is] such a nice guy. He shows up on set and makes everyone laugh, and it's just a nice day at work,\" Zellweger said.\n\nConnick agreed, saying the off-camera friendship with his co-star made the on-camera experience an enjoyable one.\n\n\"Renee is the type of person that I got to know quickly. Well, I became friends with her quickly. She's a very mysterious, wonderful young lady,\" Connick said.\n\nDirected by Jonas Elmer, the film follows Zellweger as Lucy Hill, a Miami, Florida-based corporate shark who travels to a small Minnesota town to oversee the closing of a small factory. Upon arrival, Lucy clashes with the factory's union representative, Ted Mitchell, played by Connick. As the two begin to understand one another, their icy relationship soon melts into romance.\n\nBut the romance between Lucy and Ted is only one side of the story. Zellweger said she was instantly drawn to the role for its humor.\n\n\"I loved the physical comedy part of Lucy Hill's experience. I laughed out loud when I imagined the scenarios, and I could not wait to go and play around with that,\" she said, \"I wanted to go to work every day and laugh, and I did.\"\n\nFamous for her roles in such comedies as \"Nurse Betty\" and \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" Zellweger is no stranger to the comedic scene. With \"New In Town,\" the actress was eager to once again play a part that would make audiences laugh.\n\n\"I think the laughter, that's therapeutic,\" she said.\n\nAt a time when the country is struggling through a financial recession, Connick said, \"New In Town\" provides that necessary therapy. While the film centers on the troubles of one rural American town, it showcases a dilemma familiar to the entire country.\n\n\"I think there's a good balance of what people are really feeling right now, and you walk away from this movie with a real feeling of hope and like, 'We're going to be all right,'\" he said.\n\n\"New In Town\" opens in theaters everywhere this Friday.\n\nCNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this story.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Authorities plan to ask new questions of the family at the center of the balloon drama that captured the world's attention Thursday, as a comment in a CNN interview and other concerns raised speculation that the incident may have been staged.\n\n\n\nParents Mayumi and Richard Heene discuss the upheaval in their lives Friday on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\n\n\n\"We feel it's incumbent on us as an agency to attempt to re-interview them and establish whether this is in fact a hoax or actual event,\" Larimer County Sheriff James Alderden said at a news conference Friday. \"We believe at this time that it's a real event.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators with expertise in spotting deceptive behavior interviewed the family Thursday and believe they were not lying, Alderden said.\n\n\n\nHis office is being flooded with calls and messages from people insisting it must be, and putting \"a lot of pressure\" on authorities to charge Richard and Mayumi Heene, he said.\n\n\n\nThe sheriff's office said it was conducting background checks on the Heenes.\n\n\n\nA giant Mylar balloon took off from the backyard of the Heenes' northern Colorado home Thursday. The couple said they were terrified their 6-year-old son Falcon may have been on it. They couldn't find him.\n\n\n\nIn audio from 911 calls released Friday, the parents sounded emotional and desperate.\n\n\n\nWhen the balloon finally landed, Falcon was not on board. Later, he came out from hiding in an attic over the home's garage.\n\n\n\n\"I'm feeling very, very grateful that Falcon is among us,\" Richard Heene told CNN's \"American Morning\" on Friday. \"We went through so many emotions yesterday.\"\n\n\n\nOn CNN's \"Larry King Live\" Thursday night, the Heene parents asked Falcon why he had not come out from hiding when they were calling for him. \"You guys said we did this for the show,\" he said.  Watch the boy's remarks \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe family chases storms and takes videos of some. The Heenes also were featured in March on the ABC program \"Wife Swap.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the Hollywood gossip Web site TMZ.com reported that the Heenes had been \"pitching a reality show about the wacky family,\" one of the networks mentioned, TLC, which produces \"Jon and Kate plus 8,\" said \"they approached us months ago, and we passed.\"\n\n\n\nTwo other production companies, Reality Real and RDF, which produces \"Wife Swap,\" did not immediately respond to CNN's queries.\n\n\n\nThey family had a video camera recording as the balloon took off Thursday. Alderden said that was because the family planned an experiment in which the balloon was to rise 20 feet off the ground.\n\n\n\nRichard Heene said his son was confused when he made the show remark. There were media assembled on the front lawn, asking all sorts of questions, and that's what Falcon was referring to, Heene said Friday morning.\n\n\n\nHeene, a meteorologist who takes his family along to chase storms, said he was concerned when the balloon took off because \"the project was pretty much down the tubes.\" Then their son Bradford said he thought Falcon was inside, sparking the family's terror -- and the world's response, as people tuned in to live TV coverage of the balloon, which looked like a cross between a mushroom and a flying saucer.\n\n\n\nAlderden told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that, based on reports that the parents \"took these children into potentially dangerous situations\" with tornado chases, the experimental balloons and other activities, it would be \"appropriate to involve child protection [services] to at least see what the family situation is and whether the children are in a safe condition.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier, Alderden told reporters that his department has contacted the child protection officials but asked them not to contact the family until investigators have had a chance to re-interview them.\n\n\n\nAlderden, at Friday's news conference, said he did not believe Falcon could have been following instructions by going into hiding. \"I just can't see this particular boy being told go sit up there for five hours and be quiet. I just don't see that, as hyperactive as he is,\" the sheriff said.\n\n\n\nHe also called it unlikely that the other two brothers, ages 8 and 10, would have pulled off such a hoax.\n\n\n\nIf it were determined that the incident was a hoax, \"the only thing we have is them making a false report to authorities, which is a Class 3 misdemeanor,\" Alderden said.\n\n\n\nBut, he said, authorities could seek to recoup the money spent. \"If there is criminal conduct, we certainly would seek restitution,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe balloon landed in a plowed wheat field, and the owner could seek compensation from the family, Alderden added.\n\n\n\nAsked whether the parents would not have checked the whereabouts of their three children before allowing the device to take off and why the system to tether it was not stronger, Alderden responded, \"You raise some very valid points that we are considering.\"  Watch as home video shows the balloon take off \u00bb\n\n\n\nAlderden also said his office had contacted an expert at Colorado State University during the incident to make sure that the dimensions of the balloon were adequate to handle a child of Falcon's weight, he said.\n\n\n\nThe sheriff also sought to defend his department. Authorities had been at the house and had conducted searches for the boy three times during the incident. \"Obviously it wasn't as thorough as we would have liked it to be,\" he said, \"because the boy was hiding in the attic in the garage.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators had seen the rafters in the garage, but there was no ladder to get up there. \"Our personnel just didn't think it possible that a 6-year-old boy would be able to get up into that space, so they didn't look there,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFalcon was not in a box as Alderden had originally reported. Instead, he had apparently crawled on a box in order to enter the attic area, Alderden said.  Watch how the events played out \u00bb\n\n\n\nDespite numerous conspiracy theories flying around on the Internet, Alderden emphasized that authorities have not seen suspicious behavior by the Heene family.\n\n\n\n\"They appropriately expressed statements, nonverbal communication, body language and emotions during this event that were entirely consistent with the events that were taking place,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Certainly, people are free to speculate, they're free to be skeptical about it,\" Alderden added. \"But those of us in the law enforcement profession have to operate on facts and what we can prove.\"",

A fourth officer was injured.\n\n\n\nThe Guerrero attorney general's office said the attacks could have been conducted by the same people, as there was a 30-minute gap between them, the state agency reported.\n\n\n\nIt was unknown whether the attacks were connected with Saturday's shootout, which started when soldiers went to a location called Avenida Rancho Grande in Acapulco on an anonymous tip.

Sixteen gunmen and two soldiers were killed, and nine soldiers were wounded, the statement said.\n\n\n\nAfter that incident, authorities seized 36 large-caliber weapons, 13 small-caliber weapons, two grenade launchers, 13 fragmentation grenades, 3,525 rounds of various caliber ammunition, 180 charges and eight vehicles, the ministry said.",

  "context": "KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- Police in Uganda have arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide.\n\n\n\nThe 100-day killing rampage led to the loss of an estimated 10 percent of Rwanda's population.\n\n\n\nIIdephonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala, by the National Central Bureau of Interpol, according to a news release from the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHe was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based. Top officials who allegedly took part in the genocide, such as army generals and politicians, are tried by the tribunal.\n\n\n\n\"Nizeyimana is one of the four top accused who are earmarked by the prosecutor to be tried by the tribunal in Arusha after their arrest as part of the ICTR completion strategy,\" the tribunal's news release said. Of a list of 13 fugitives, he is the second to be arrested in less than two months, it said.\n\n\n\nIn the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and went on a 100-day killing rampage. Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million -- 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents.\n\n\n\nNizeyimana was a captain the Rwanda Armed Forces, the tribunal said. He is accused of exercising authority over soldiers and personnel through a chain of command, and allegedly sent a section of soldiers to execute of Rosalie Gicanda, a former queen of Rwanda who was a \"symbolic figure for all Tutsis,\" it said.\n\n\n\nThe tribunal noted this marks the second time Uganda has cooperated with it to make an arrest. \"The tribunal has commended the Interpol and the Ugandan authorities for their close cooperation,\" the news release said.\n\n\n\nSamson Ntale contributed to this report for CNN.",

  "context": "Editor's Note: Lucas A. Powe Jr. is a professor of constitutional law at The University of Texas and the author of the recently published book, \"The Supreme Court and the American Elite, 1789-2008.\" He clerked for Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.\n\n\n\nLucas Powe Jr. says it's not a surprise that justices voted 5-4 in favor of the New Haven firefighters.\n\n\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Monday, in the much anticipated New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters' case, the Supreme Court reversed an opinion joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\n\n\n\nThe reversal was expected and is not the first time an appointee has been reversed by the court he was about to join.\n\n\n\nIndeed, two of Chief Justice Warren Burger's opinions for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals were reversed in 1969, the year he joined the court. One was Watts v. United States, in which the defendant had been convicted for threatening the life of the president.\n\n\n\nBy a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that Watts' supposed threats were really nothing but hyperbole. The decision came down one month before President Nixon nominated Burger. More significantly, after Burger had been confirmed, the Court reversed him again, this time in a major case -- Powell v. McCormack.\n\n\n\nThe House had refused to seat Harlem, New York, Democratic Rep. Adam Clayton Powell after he won yet another election. The reasons for the House's action were misappropriation of public funds and abuse of process in state courts to avoid paying a judgment.\n\n\n\nBurger wrote that federal courts could not decide Powell's case because the issue was nonjusticiable -- that is, not appropriate for a judicial resolution because issues of membership in Congress were exclusively committed to Congress.\n\n\n\nWhen the case reached the Supreme Court, a lengthy opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren held that courts could rule in such a case and that a House of Congress could only exclude someone if that person did not meet the qualifications, age, citizenship and residence requirements set forth in the Constitution. There was but a single dissent.\n\n\n\nThe reversal of Sotomayor was expected because a majority of the current court are Republicans who believe governmental decisions should be made on a color-blind basis. Beginning with the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Republicans have taken aim at affirmative action, and the Republican justices have concurred.\n\n\n\nOnly once in the past 15 years has the Republican majority voted in favor of minorities in an affirmative action case. That came in 2003, when the court upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\n\n\nThat case, however, was profoundly influenced by an amicus brief signed by 45 retired admirals and generals (plus former Defense Secretary William Cohen) stating that affirmative action was essential at the Service Academies in order to create a diverse officer corps in order to ensure necessary military cohesiveness.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the military brief, Solicitor General Theodore Olson stated that he had not thought about the consequences of ending affirmative action at the Service Academies.\n\n\n\nThat was enough for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican, who switched from her normal skepticism of affirmative action to sustain the law school program. Nevertheless, four Republican justices -- William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas -- voted to invalidate the program.\n\n\n\nWith John Roberts replacing Rehnquist and Samuel Alito replacing O'Connor, the court acquired a majority that appears more concerned about discrimination against whites than about racial equality in American society. Thus just two years ago in cases out of Seattle, Washington, and Louisville, Kentucky, the Republican majority invalidated school assignment plans that the school districts themselves had decided were appropriate to prevent resegregation.\n\n\n\nWith those cases as background, the majority's sympathy for the plight of Frank Ricci, who studied so hard for the New Haven promotion examination, was easily predictable. But so was the fact that the four dissenters in the Seattle and Louisville cases -- John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and the now-retired David Souter -- would side with the city in its concern that the results of the test left no African-Americans eligible for promotion.\n\n\n\nWhat the New Haven case showed was that Republicans have been winning presidential elections and therefore gaining Supreme Court nominations more often than Democrats for the past generation.\n\n\n\nSo when a Democratic president finally got a nomination, any person selected would dissent from the Republicans' disdain for affirmative action. It is merely a coincidence that the nominee, Sotomayor, happened to participate in the case already.\n\n\n\nSome Republican senators may try to use the New Haven majority to paint Sotomayor as out of the mainstream. But that conclusion requires painting the four dissenters as out of the mainstream, too. Only the Republican base could believe that. Sotomayor will be confirmed without a hiccup.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lucas A. Powe Jr.",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- He is the international superstar responsible for breathing life into the iconic comic book hero Wolverine. Her movies have earned more than $2 billion worldwide, including the entire \"X-Men\" franchise.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugh Jackman emerges as Wolverine in \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\" which opened Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nActor Hugh Jackman and film producer Lauren Shuler Donner recently sat down for a candid conversation about their new film, \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the pair talked about the scene in which Jackman's character is transformed from a simple mutant with bony claws that periodically protrude from the back of his hands to an invincible mutant filled with an indestructible metal called adamantium.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scene represents the ultimate birth of a comic legend as the character is transformed from Logan to Wolverine.  Watch the scene in which Wolverine is unleashed \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nHugh Jackman: I knew this was the birth of the character; this is where we see him in full flight. It's called in the comic book \"berserker rage.\" It's not really in the English language, but it may be now! But, this idea that this complete animal [has been] unleashed, which is obviously the entire story -- this battle between the animal and human is something we all relate to.\n\n\n\n\n\nLauren Shuler Donner: There were many things he had to do in the tank, you know. One of them was he had to be lowered, and then the needles had to come towards him.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, most of those were CGI, so he had to look in certain places where the needles were. But, he couldn't hear [director] Gavin [Hood]. So they ... tried all kinds of sounds, speakers, everything. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nThey finally devised this toe method where, if Gavin pulled on Hugh's big toe, it meant the things are coming, the second toe is this, the last toe is rise up, very sophisticated. (laughter)\n\n\n\n\n\nJackman: I had in my head that I've got to be in much better shape -- not better shape, different shape, kind of ridiculous shape because I wanted it to be uncomfortable. I wanted it to feel like I felt when I saw Robert De Niro in \"Cape Fear,\" that -- whoa, this guy is dangerous, he's powerful, he's dangerous, and he can snap at any point.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonner: There's an iconic drawing of Wolverine coming out of the tank in the comics with the things popping out of him and his hair all over him in a rage, and we wanted to be that image. That's the image we wanted for the fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackman: I was a little frightened when I watched it, like, \"Is that me?\" [My wife] Deb was like, \"Hugh, this is ridiculous. I don't even know who that is.\"",

  "context": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Pirates holding a Saudi-owned oil supertanker off the coast of Somalia have set the vessel free after receiving a ransom payment, a piracy monitor in neighboring Kenya and the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet said Saturday.\n\n\n\nA small aircraft drops a ransom payment during a flight over the Sirius Star on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"The supertanker VLCC Sirius Star is currently under way to safe waters,\" Andrew Mwangura of the Kenya Seafarers Association said in an e-mail.\n\n\n\nMwangura said all 23 crew members of the Sirius Star, the largest ship ever hijacked by pirates, are safe and in good health. They are citizens of Croatia, Great Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\"Anytime a ship is released, it is positive news,\" said Cmdr. Jane Campbell of the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. \"But too many people see it as a ship and its cargo being released. When merchant mariners are released, it is always good news.\"\n\n\n\nThe ship is a VLCC, or \"very large crude carrier.\" According to the Fifth Fleet, the tanker is more than three times the size of a U.S. navy aircraft carrier.\n\n\n\nPirates seized the supertanker November 15. The tanker was carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $100 million. The Liberian-flagged tanker is owned by Vela International Marine Ltd., a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabian-based Saudi Aramco.\n\n\n\nSaleh K'aki, president and CEO of Vela International, said in a statement, \"We are very relieved to know that all crew members are safe and I am glad to say that they are all in good health and high spirits. This has been a very trying time for them and certainly for their families. We are very happy to report to their families that they will be on their way home soon.\"\n\n\n\nMwangura said it would have been a \"disaster\" if the pirates had fired guns aboard the ship, harming the cargo or igniting a fire.\n\n\n\n\"The capture of the Sirius Star raised the specter of an environmental disaster should the hijackers decide to turn the ship into a weapon or foreign navies attempt to release it by force,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe pirates had been expected to release the supertanker after receiving the ransom payment Friday, but four pirates drowned after their skiff capsized in rough seas while they were leaving the Sirius Star, according to a journalist who spoke to one of the pirates on board.  Watch ransom being parachuted to ship \u00bb\n\n\n\nThere were five pirates in the skiff and one survived, the journalist said. The bodies of the other four were recovered, he said.\n\n\n\nThe pirates told another journalist they received $3 million in ransom money but lost part of it when the skiff capsized.\n\n\n\n\"Initially, the gunmen were demanding $25 million for its release but the latest reports indicate that the demand had been lowered to below $3.5 million,\" Mwangura said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, pirates also have released the MV Delight, an Iranian chartered ship carrying wheat from Germany, Mwangura said. It was captured in November. Details were not immediately available.\n\n\n\nHijackings off East Africa are a cause of growing international concern, spurring a number of international navies to patrol the pirate-wracked Gulf of Aden. Dozens of ships have been attacked in the gulf by pirates based in a largely lawless Somalia in recent months.  See how pirate attacks are on the rise \u00bb\n\n\n\nCampbell said the number of attacks may have gone up in recent months, but the number of successful hijackings has gone down. She attributed that to measures taken by merchant ships, such as vigilant keeping of watch and evasive ship maneuvers, and the increased naval presence in the at-risk areas.\n\n\n\nCampbell stressed, however, that they are only preventive measures.\n\n\n\n\"Piracy is a problem that starts on the shore,\" she said. \"The international community needs to address the situation on the ground in Somalia.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(Mental Floss) -- We're in the throes of summer vacation season, but at least one American is still on the job. While it's rumored that President Obama will follow in the footsteps of President Clinton and vacation on Martha's Vineyard, he hasn't had a chance to break out his Bermuda shorts just yet. When Obama does take off, though, he'll join in the grand tradition of presidential vacations, like these notable ones:\n\n\n\nPresident Bush (R) and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen ride bikes in Crawford, Texas, in 2008.\n\n\n\n1. Abe Lincoln doesn't go too far\n\n\n\nFar-flung vacations are nice, but President Lincoln preferred to stay a bit closer to home. When Lincoln needed a getaway from the heat and political turmoil of Civil War-era Washington, D.C., he headed to...a different part of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nFrom 1862 to 1864 Lincoln spent June through November living in a cottage atop a hill at the Soldiers' Home a few miles from the White House. Lincoln apparently loved the slight change of scenery, which meant slightly cooler temperatures and a chance to ride his horse each morning. If you're considering a stay-cation this year, consider this Honest Abe's endorsement.\n\n\n\n2. Movie cowboy does real ranching\n\n\n\nThink George W. Bush was the first president to sneak away from the White House to spend time on his ranch? Not quite. At the end of his second term as Governor of California in 1974, Ronald Reagan paid just over half a million dollars to acquire Rancho del Cielo in California's Santa Ynez Mountains.\n\n\n\nThe 688-acre ranch, complete with stables and a 1500-square-foot adobe house, was Reagan's go-to vacation destination while he was in office, and he entertained some big names there, including Margaret Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth II, and Mikhail Gorbachev, who gamely wore a cowboy hat during his visit.\n\n\n\n3. LBJ does some ranching, too\n\n\n\nTexan Lyndon Johnson was very involved in the everyday operations of his ranch. Johnson, who had gotten into ranching in 1951, grew his LBJ Ranch into a 2,700-acre spread populated by 400 head of Hereford cattle.\n\n\n\nJohnson was no absentee owner when he was in Washington, either. Johnson frequently headed back on vacations and supposedly drove his foreman crazy by calling every day to talk about the weather on the ranch or how the pastures looked. Today, the National Park Service maintains LBJ's spread as a working ranch, complete with a herd of cattle descended from the Herefords Johnson bred.\n\n\n\n4. George W. Bush initiates a war on brush\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush followed in LBJ's footsteps and went to his own Texas ranch when he needed a getaway. Prairie Chapel Ranch, a 1,583-acre spread Bush owns near Crawford, Texas, served as the secondary White House throughout Bush's presidency, and he was often shown clearing brush during vacations.\n\n\n\nBush wasn't just doing farm work, though. He exhorted visitors to join the \"President's 100-Degrees Club\" by running three miles or biking 10 after the mercury hit 100 degrees. Anyone who could pull of the feat got a specialized Under Armour shirt as recognition.\n\n\n\nWe can only hope one of the many foreign dignitaries Bush entertained at the ranch -- including Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, Silvio Berlusconi, Ariel Sharon, and Saudi King Abdullah -- managed to get one of the coveted shirts into their suitcases. Mental Floss: Iraq, Afghanistan and other extreme vacation spots\n\n\n\n5. FDR heats up Georgia\n\n\n\nSome presidents choose to head to their hometowns or a beach side resort for their vacations, but Franklin Roosevelt preferred to travel to western Georgia. Warm Springs, Georgia, is the home of (you guessed it!) warm springs that supposedly had therapeutic value for polio sufferers. FDR, who had contracted his own paralytic illness in 1921, started visiting Warm Springs in 1924 in the hope that exercising in the springs' warm waters would cure him.\n\n\n\nAlthough the springs didn't reverse his illness, FDR felt like his time at the resort alleviated his symptoms somewhat. In 1927 he bought the resort he'd been staying at, and in 1932 he ordered a six-room Georgia pine house to be built on the property. This house was FDR's retreat throughout his presidency and became known as the Little White House.\n\n\n\nFDR was sitting for a portrait at the Little White House when he died of a stroke in April 1945. Today, the house is part of Georgia's state park system and is open to visitors; it's been preserved to look almost exactly as it did the day FDR died.\n\n\n\n6. Nixon gets the right ice cubes\n\n\n\nWhen Richard Nixon wanted a break from Washington, he headed to a modest ranch home he owned on Key Biscayne off Miami. Nixon's \"Florida White House,\" which he visited 50-plus times during his tenure in office, eventually swelled to include three houses and a floating helipad, which the Department of Defense installed at a taxpayer expense of $400,000. (There was plenty of room for taxpayer outrage at the $625,000 total the government spent sprucing up the Florida White House; one itemized expense was $621 for a replacement icemaker because \"the President does not like ice with holes in it.\")\n\n\n\nGiven that this house was Nixon's retreat, it's no surprise that some shady dealings transpired on the premises. Nixon allegedly discussed plans for the Watergate break-in at the house, and he holed up there when the coverup came to light. The house fell into disrepair after Nixon sold it, and in 2004 it was razed to make room for a new building.\n\n\n\nThe Florida White House wasn't Nixon's only retreat, though. He bought a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean in San Clemente, California, shortly after taking office in 1969. Nixon dubbed his new digs \"La Casa Pacifica,\" but the press quickly started referring to the spread as \"the Western White House.\" This house wasn't cheap for taxpayers, either; the government dropped over a million dollars improving this home with temporary office quarters for staffers, helipads, and an upgraded heating system. Mental Floss: Donald Nixon and other memorable presidential siblings\n\n\n\n7. Teddy Roosevelt goes bear hunting\n\n\n\nLounging on the beach is great, but do you really think Teddy Roosevelt would miss the opportunity to do something manly? Roosevelt's vacation in 1905 took him to the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, where he stayed for three weeks while bear hunting.\n\n\n\n8. FDR's successor gets his own little White House\n\n\n\nHarry Truman may have been from Missouri, but he headed south when he needed some R&R. Truman started suffering from exhaustion in late 1946, and his physicians recommended a warm weather vacation to revitalize the President.\n\n\n\nTruman took his vacation in a converted duplex in Key West that already held some history. The house, which was originally built in 1890 for the commandant and paymaster of Key West's naval base, had already hosted William Howard Taft while he was in office in 1912. When Thomas Edison developed 41 new weapons to aid in the American efforts in World War I, he spent six months living in the house.\n\n\n\nOnce Truman visited the house, though, it quickly became known as Truman's Little White House. He ended up spending 175 days in Key West over the course of his two terms in office. Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy later used the house while they were in office, and it's now open as a tourist attraction. Mental Floss: Early summer jobs of Truman, LBJ and more\n\n\n\n9. Kennedy retreats to his compound\n\n\n\nStarting in 1926, Joseph P. Kennedy began taking his family to Hyannisport, Massachusetts, on vacation each summer. His son John liked the area so much that in 1956 he bought a cottage of his own near his parents' digs, and the family soon purchased a third cottage in the area, giving rise to the name \"the Kennedy Compound.\" JFK used his cottage as a base of operations for his presidential campaign and later vacationed there each summer he was in office.\n\n\n\n10. George H.W. Bush prefers not to ranch\n\n\n\nNot to be outdone by the Kennedys, the Bush family has an even older compound of their own in Kennebunkport, Maine. In 1903 George H. Walker, the grandfather of George H.W. Bush, built a great mansion on his oceanfront estate in Kennebunkport, and the property has remained in the family ever since.\n\n\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush used the Kennebunkport compound as his vacation home during his presidency, and George W. Bush made a few getaways to the house as well. Between father and son, they've entertained some pretty big names at their summer house, including Yitzhak Rabin, Vladimir Putin, and Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a lifetime of playing characters past-their-prime, Clint Eastwood appears to still be enjoying his own.\n\n\n\nClint Eastwood stars as inspector Harry Callahan in \"Dirty Harry\" (1971).\n\n\n\nJust last week the 78-year-old actor, best-known for his portrayal of \"tough guys\" like \"Dirty Harry,\" was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n\nThe American film-maker accepted the Palme d'Or (only the second they've ever given for lifetime achievement), while he was in town promoting his new film \"Gran Torino.\" What is your favorite Clint Eastwood movie? Tell us below in the SoundOff box.\n\n\n\nEastwood both directs and co-stars in \"Gran Torino,\" as a prejudiced Korean war veteran who comes to the rescue of troubled Asian teens who live next door.\n\n\n\nFor Eastwood the honor caps a 40 year career acting, directing, producing and composing. During this time, he has won five Academy Awards, five Golden Globes and received many more nominations.\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood veteran earned perhaps most acclaim for two films: \"Unforgiven\" (1992) and \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). For each of these films he was awarded both Best Director and Best Picture Oscars, as well as being nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role.\n\n\n\nEastwood got his break in 1959, landing the role of Rowdy Yates in the television series \"Rawhide.\" A successful seven-year run helped turn Eastwood into a household name and landed him several other roles in so-called Spaghetti Western films, including the hit \"A Fist Full of Dollars\" (1964), directed by Sergio Leone.\n\n\n\nLeone then re-hired Eastwood for two more successful films: \"For a Few More Dollars\" (1965) and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966). The trilogy earned Eastwood greater fame and a reputation for playing tough-guy, gun-slinging cowboys.\n\n\n\nEastwood found another friend in director Don Siegel who gave him perhaps his most iconic role, starring in \"Dirty Harry\" (1971) as no-nonsense, \"loose-cannon\" cop Harry Callahan.\n\n\n\nThe film was such a hit that it four spin off sequels were made: \"Magnum Force\" (1973), \"The Enforcer\" (1976), \"Sudden Impact\" (1983) (the highest grossing film of the series), and \"The Dead Pool\" (1988).\n\n\n\nIn the 1990s Eastwood returned to westerns -- this time as director as well as star -- earning critical acclaim and a monumental nine Oscar nominations for \"Unforgiven\" (1992). Throughout the decade he also had considerable success helming blockbuster projects, like \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), \"Bridges of Madison County\" (1995) and \"True Crime\" (1999).\n\n\n\nIn 2000 Eastwood co-starred in the box-office hit \"Space Cowboys.\" In 2004, he put employed his entire array of movie skills directing, producing, scoring and co-starring alongside Hillary Swank in boxing drama \"Million Dollar Baby.\"\n\n\n\nUntil his most recent return to the screen in \"Gran Torino,\" Eastwood had been concentrating on directing, releasing two films about World War II in 2006, \"Flags of our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" and directing Angelina Jolie to BAFTA, Golden Globe and Oscar nominations this year in \"Changeling.\"\n\n\n\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is the only other film-maker to have received the Palme d'Or for lifetime achievement from the Cannes Film Festival.",

  "context": "PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French are in for a significant cultural shift next week if the Senate approves a new law from President Nicolas Sarkozy to allow more shops to open on Sundays.\n\n\n\nThe law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones.\n\n\n\nWhat seems routine in much of the Western world has been fiercely resisted in France, where Sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century and where a 35-hour workweek remains the norm.\n\n\n\nThe new legislation, if approved by the Senate, would overturn a 1906 law that forbids Sunday trading in all but the largest cities. It is part of a raft of reforms Sarkozy has pushed for since becoming president.\n\n\n\nWhile the change is significant, it is not as much as the government originally hoped because Sarkozy had to deal with opposition from both the left and the right.\n\n\n\nSocialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays.\n\n\n\nMembers of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day.\n\n\n\nIf approved by the Senate, the law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called \"exceptional commercial\" centers near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles, and Lille.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas, which already allow some economic activity on Sundays.\n\n\n\nThe new law will, among other things, straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores managed to obtain exceptions from the old law and others didn't, and where some stores found it made more sense financially to accept fines for breaking the old law because the income from Sunday sales more than made up for the penalties.\n\n\n\nThe measure passed the National Assembly last Tuesday by a vote of 282 to 238. It will go the Senate for three days of debate next Tuesday, where it is almost certain to be approved.\n\n\n\nOpinion polls in France show that slightly more than half the population want shops to have the freedom to open on Sundays, according to Time magazine.\n\n\n\nCNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.",

  "context": "SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- Senior Pakistani and Indian military officials met Tuesday to discuss a border clash in Kashmir, the first major skirmish between South Asia's nuclear rivals since a 2003 cease-fire.\n\n\n\nIndian army soldiers on the outskirts of Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar.\n\n\n\nPakistan's army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN that Pakistan \"made our point clear\" regarding the firefight, which he said began after Indian soldiers crossed the Line of Control that separates Kashmir between India and Pakistan.\n\n\n\nBut an Indian military spokeswoman, Capt. Neha Goyal, told CNN Pakistani troops crossed the Line of Control and \"started firing on our patrol,\" killing an Indian soldier.\n\n\n\n\"Our troops also retaliated and the Pakistan army troopers ran back,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAbbas said \"further action should be taken\" following Tuesday's \"flag meeting,\" but did not elaborate. The meeting took place along the Line of Control.\n\n\n\nReports in India's media said four Pakistani soldiers were killed, but Pakistan's military \"strongly denied the report of any (casualties) on the Pakistani side.\"\n\n\n\nPakistan's military also denied its forces crossed the Line of Control, saying the skirmish started when Indian soldiers tried to establish a forward post on Pakistan's side of the line.\n\n\n\n\"On Pakistan's' objection, Indian troops opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire,\" a Pakistan military news release, posted on Monday, stated.\n\n\n\n\"The Indian fire was immediately responded to. The firing continued -- intermittently during the whole night.\"\n\n\n\nPakistan said the Indian soldiers \"were forced to flee from the area leaving behind their weapons\" after the firefight.\n\n\n\nIndian and Pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since May, but Monday's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations.\n\n\n\nIndia and Pakistan had announced a bilateral cease-fire all along their borders in November 2003 and the cease-fire had been holding on the borders until recently.\n\n\n\nKashmir has been at the root of two wars between India and Pakistan, both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998.\n\n\n\nAn 18-year separatist campaign in the Indian-controlled portion of the largely Muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives, according to government officials, although human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the toll at twice that number.\n\n\n\nIndia has long accused Pakistan of supporting the separatists in Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies. India blamed militants from Pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in Afghanistan that killed 58 people on July 7.\n\n\n\nA December 2001 attack on India's parliament that India blamed on the militants brought the two nations to the brink of another war, but they have expanded economic and cultural ties since the November 2003 cease-fire agreement.\n\n\n\n-- CNN's Aliza Kassim in Atlanta and Mukhtar Ahmad in Srinagar contributed to this report",

  "context": "(CNN) -- As the April 15 income tax filing deadline approaches, the top tax expert at the National Association for the Self-Employed offers his best advice for business people who work for themselves.\n\n\n\nKeith Hall, a national tax adviser at the association, answers the tax question he is asked most often and talks about changes in tax rules for small-business owners. He also offers advice about how the self-employed can best avoid being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\n\nCNN: What should self-employed taxpayers keep at the top of their minds this year?\n\n\n\nKeith Hall: I think the most important thing to remember is that you have resources. The IRS is always changing information -- from automobile deductions, to alternative minimum tax limits, to net operating loss carry-forwards.\n\n\n\nIt's tough to keep up with, but you don't have to remember it, because it's all out there on the IRS Web site for you.\n\n\n\nDon't forget, you've got resources to go out and look for.\n\n\n\nCNN: What's different this year for self-employed taxpayers?\n\n\n\nHall: Perhaps the most important thing unique to this year is there are so many businesses which were affected by the downturn in the economy, that the IRS has expanded opportunities for loss carrybacks.\n\n\n\nThe definition of a loss carryback is if you had losses from your business in 2009, then you may have the opportunity to then take those losses and offset income from previous years.\n\n\n\nThat's certainly something to look into if you had a tough year for 2009, because it may give you the ability to recover taxes in more years -- namely five -- than you used to be able to, which is just two. So if that's the situation that you find yourself in, certainly look into options for those loss carrybacks.\n\n\n\nIt certainly can help you with the tax impact. More particularly, for those new to being self-employed or maybe even their first year filing a Schedule C, make sure you look for deductions that don't appear in your business checkbook.\n\n\n\nIt's very easy to overlook deductions like the deduction for the home office that you use, deduction for the business use of your automobile -- those typically don't show up in your business checkbook, so if you don't know to look for them, they're very easily overlooked, and that's basically just leaving money on the table.\n\n\n\nCNN: What can self-employed workers do to avoid an IRS audit?\n\n\n\nHall: The No. 1 reason a small business gets audited or asked for additional information by the IRS is simple math errors -- the numbers simply don't add up correctly on the form.\n\n\n\nWhether you use TurboTax or TaxCut or the IRS online filing, it's a great idea -- particularly for the new small business -- to make sure you use that software package -- if nothing else -- just to make sure those math errors are eliminated.\n\n\n\nDon't be too afraid of an IRS audit. Obviously, when people think in terms of the IRS, they get a little bit antsy. Nobody likes to get that letter in the mailbox on Saturday morning that's got an IRS return address in the upper left-hand corner.\n\n\n\nBut if you do, the best thing to keep in mind is pay attention to your tax return. Do the due diligence that you need to to avoid the little shortcuts of filling in numbers that you don't have support for.\n\n\n\nIf you just take the time to pay attention to the business and do the tax return the way you should, there's nothing to be afraid of with that audit.\n\n\n\nSo at a very minimum -- just to ease the stress of that potential letter you're going to get form the IRS -- just make sure you take the extra time to use resources like nase.org, like the IRS Web site at irs.gov, and just make sure you dot your I's and cross your Ts. And then, if you do get a request from the IRS, it won't be stressful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What are some important tax law changes for tax year 2009?\n\n\n\nHall: Always be aware that every year, the IRS changes something.\n\n\n\nFor example, automobile mileage: The new rate for 2009 is 55 cents. Make sure you get that one correct.\n\n\n\nThe IRS always changes the adjusted limits for alternative minimum tax. For the standard itemized deductions, all those levels are adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n\nMake sure that you get those right numbers. Using an automated software program -- having that system in place -- will help you keep up with any of those changes that occur as a matter of course with the IRS every year.\n\n\n\nCNN: What's the most frequent tax question you get asked?\n\n\n\nHall: The first question we typically get, particularly at tax return time, is \"What can I do right now to save money on last year's tax return?\"\n\n\n\nMost tax planning ideas really end with the New Year's Eve party. But the one thing you can do today to save money on your taxes for last year is to consider making a retirement plan contribution -- whether it's a traditional IRA contribution, a self-employed pension plan contribution, lots of different ways to put money away for your own future.\n\n\n\nThe IRS recognizes how important that is, and they'll even give you a tax deduction for it.\n\n\n\nSo you can actually reduce the taxes you have to pay right now, just by putting money away for your own future. That's certainly something that should be considered.\n\n\n\nCNN: Should we expect future tax breaks for small businesses?\n\n\n\nHall: The current administration and both sides of the House and Senate all promote the growth of jobs through small business.\n\n\n\nThe influences of small business in generating jobs -- which are more and more important these days -- is only going to increase the influence of small business.\n\n\n\nWhether it's legislation for a standard home office deduction, which is pending, legislation for additional health credits and concentration on affordability for health care for the self-employed, which is also pending, there's lots of legislation out there to benefit small business.\n\n\n\nThe more and more small businesses we have, I think more emphasis in Washington and at the state level will focus on benefits for the self-employed.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Internet sensation Susan Boyle came up short, coming in second during \"Britain's Got Talent\" finale on Saturday.\n\n\n\nFans cheering on Susan Boyle react after she comes in second during \"Britain's Got Talent.\"\n\n\n\nBoyle was upset by winner Diversity, a 10-person dance group from Essex and East London, England, ranging in age from 12 to 25 years old. The group won 100,000 British pounds ($161,000) and will perform for Queen Elizabeth II in the Royal Variety Show.\n\n\n\n\"The best people won,\" Boyle said.\n\n\n\nThe dancers appeared shocked Saturday when it was announced that they had won.\n\n\n\nThe group was formed in 2007, and in the same year won the United Kingdom Dance Championships.\n\n\n\nThe group's choreographer \"tries to create a dance style that is eye-catching and entertaining\" and uses films such as 2007's \"Transformers\" for inspiration, the show's site said.\n\n\n\nBoyle wowed the crowd Saturday night with an encore performance of the song that first made her so famous around the world -- \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" from the musical \"Les Miserables.\"\n\n\n\nAfter her performance Saturday, the crowd and judges gave Boyle, who wore a floor-length gown, a standing ovation.  Boyle finishes second \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"You had the nerve to come back here tonight, face your critics and beat them,\" judge Simon Cowell told her. \"You did it.\"\n\n\n\nBoyle had vowed to leave the television show before the finale, after a hectic week, but recanted and performed at the finale Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe 48-year-old Scottish singer wowed audiences and judges during her audition in April when she belted out \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" Her performance earned her a string of global television appearances.\n\n\n\nDuring the semifinals Sunday, she started off by missing the first note of her performance of \"Memory\" from the musical, \"Cats.\"  Watch Boyle's semifinal performance \u00bb\n\n\n\nShe redeemed herself to earn a standing ovation and a spot in Saturday's finale.\n\n\n\nThe global fame and the \"odd bit of negative press\" in the past week have been too overwhelming for her, judge Piers Morgan told CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"She's just had a pretty rough week because I think the full enormity of what has happened to her is beginning to hit home,\" Morgan said.\n\n\n\n\"Earlier this week, she had a lot of tears. ... At one stage, she was going to leave the show. So, fortunately, we've calmed everything down.\"  Watch how Boyle may be feeling the pressure \u00bb\n\n\n\nBoyle said that that she has put the tumultuous week behind her and is getting ready for the finale.\n\n\n\n\"It's all I've been thinking about,\" she said on the show's Web site. \"I'm not going to throw away my big chance now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Britain's Got Talent\" defended Boyle on its Web site, saying that media reports of an emotional outburst \"have been taken out of context.\"\n\n\n\nThe unemployed charity worker has inspired millions in the face of pop music's penchant for pre-processed princesses.\n\n\n\nBefore she sang during her audition, the unassuming single woman with a loose mop of curly hair drew snickers from the audience, including notoriously hard-to-please judge Simon Cowell.\n\n\n\nThe scowls and eye-rolling were replaced by wild cheers as soon as she sang the first line.\n\n\n\nCowell later apologized for poking fun at her during the auditions stage.\n\n\n\n\"You are one special lady,\" he said last week. \"You really are.\"\n\n\n\nReporters made their way to her quiet home in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland, much to Boyle's great surprise.\n\n\n\n\"I keep my feet firmly planted on the ground, because you have to,\" Boyle told CNN last month.\n\n\n\nAsked what has been the most surprising change since her audition, she responded simply -- \"The way everyone seems to have embraced me. The way they seem to have apparently fallen in love with me.\"",

He said he bought it from the flea market shopper, who has asked not to be identified.\n\n\n\nThe song was intended to be played in schools to inspire and teach children and was first played in public on July 4, 1831, in the First Baptist Church in Newton, Massachusetts, Morgan said. The song is written to the tune of \"God Save the Queen,\" the national anthem of the United Kingdom.  Take a look at the manuscript \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe authenticity of the document was confirmed by Morgan, a handwriting expert who has been authenticating historical documents for nearly a decade, and Diana Yount, an archival specialist at Andover Newton Theological School. Yount reached her conclusion after comparing the handwriting with that in a hymn written by Smith.\n\n\n\nMorgan, whose collection includes artifacts from Abraham Lincoln, Marilyn Monroe, Thomas Jefferson and Ulysses S. Grant, was ecstatic.\n\n\n\n\"It's the biggest high I could get,\" said Morgan. \"It shaped the nation and reminds us that this nation is just a baby.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The city of Fargo, North Dakota, largely completed flood preparations early Thursday as a surging Red River rose nearly 3 feet in 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe waterway was well beyond its banks along the North Dakota-Minnesota line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks to our volunteers, we've been able to fill a million sandbags and place 700,000 around our city,\" Fargo spokeswoman Karena Carlson said early Thursday. \"We're just buttoning up a lot of our clay levees and putting a few more sandbags in place, and we hope to be protected up to 40 feet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral hundred volunteers worked with the National Guard in Fargo to fill those sandbags as the river rose.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlooding where you are? Share pictures, video\n\n\n\n\n\nFargo set a record in 2009 when the Red River hit 40.8 feet. As of 9:15 a.m. Saturday, the river stood at 36.56 feet, more than 18 feet above the flood stage of 18 feet and past major flood stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fortunately, we started filling sandbags March 1st. We thought our crest was going to be the first or second week in April. It turns out our crest is going to be this week,\" Carlson said. \"So we did it in just over two weeks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFloodwaters are forecast to peak at 38 feet Sunday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, causing water to accumulate near the two cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the river in Moorhead, Tom Holmgren spent Wednesday filling sandbags as Minnesota State University gave students time off to help with the effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of my friends have put in at least a couple hours,\" said Holmgren, who said sandbagging has become a source of college pride. \"I know there's a big push in just the college community that's like, 'Yeah, we're doing it. We're saving this town.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne man refuses to leave his home\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 90 miles south of Fargo in Browns Valley, Minnesota, Kathryn Bartz said Thursday that she's grateful that a 40-year water diversion project is nearly complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Otherwise I believe we would have washed out a considerable amount of our town,\" said Bartz, a former town council member.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowns Valley suffered severe flooding from the winding Little Minnesota River in 2007, 1993 and 1943, and lesser floods many other years. Funding and property acquisition problems kept the diversion project -- consisting mainly of a canal to carry overflow around the town -- from being completed, Bartz said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA section of a new road that is part of the project washed out this week, but boulders and rocks were put in place to prevent further erosion, said Bartz, 66, who owns a hobby ranch outside of town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That will be repaired when the water goes down,\" she said. \"It's an inconvenience, but we are grateful that it has worked as well as it has.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the Northeast, utility crews made steady progress restoring electricity after a nor'easter -- a powerful low-pressure system -- blasted the region over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 40,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut remained without power early Thursday, down from a peak of more than 500,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We recognize the hardship our customers face from being without power for days,\" said Jeff Butler, president of Connecticut Light & Power. \"We appreciate everyone's patience as we continue to safely restore power as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outages were caused mostly by power lines downed by Saturday's hurricane-force winds, which knocked over trees and utility poles. At least seven deaths were attributed to the storm, authorities said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ed Payne and Jim Kavanagh and CNN Radio's Shelby Erdman contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The presidents of Sudan and Chad signed a non-aggression agreement late Thursday, aiming to halt cross-border hostilities between the two African nations.\n\n\n\nChad President Idriss Deby, right, and Sudan's President Omar al-Beshir, left, shake hands after signing the pact.\n\n\n\nThe signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar, Senegal, between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby, the president of Chad.\n\n\n\nSenegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m.\n\n\n\n\"The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country,\" said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq.\n\n\n\nEach country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government. The rival nations' armies have skirmished several times.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad. They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, in early February.\n\n\n\nAs recently as Thursday, just hours before the agreement was signed, Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border.\n\n\n\nChad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby's regime.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region.\n\n\n\nKingsley Amaning, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Chad, said more than 10,000 people from Darfur, in Sudan, have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad.\n\n\n\nThey join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there.\n\n\n\nThe number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there, Kingsley said.\n\n\n\nHaq said the United Nations, which has peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region, will work to assure Sudan and Chad carry out the terms of Thursday's deal. The countries have signed several peace agreements in the past, only to see renewed violence flare up. E-mail to a friend",

  "context": "New York (CNN) -- For Kenny Ortega, Travis Payne and Michael Bearden, \"It\" is a bittersweet feeling.\n\n\n\nThe three men expected to be spending their time this summer and fall working on Michael Jackson's concert engagement at London's O2 Arena, which was scheduled to begin in July. Instead, they are talking about Jackson's last days and the new movie about that time, \"This Is It.\"\n\n\n\nIn an interview, they described \"This Is It,\" the movie that they've made from rehearsal and backstage footage of Jackson, shot just before he died June 25. The film, which has been dominating advance ticket sale outlets, opens wide on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe full movie wasn't screened for critics, with only 12 minutes of footage available to the media before the interviews. But as  director Ortega describes it, the film tries to blend backstage footage with the performance to give an inside glimpse of those last days at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\nThe scenes show the superstar working on his dance moves, figuring out choreography, practicing on stage and running the show. From the clips, there's no question that Jackson was in charge. His physicality is vibrant: At one point, he dances with a troupe of top-notch hoofers and keeps up with all of them. There's no indication of the infirmities that would ultimately take his life.\n\n\n\nAll three men -- Payne was the show's choreographer and Bearden its music supervisor -- stressed how they wanted this movie to represent the Jackson they knew.\n\n\n\n\"It was an honor project,\" Bearden said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ortega, the film is for the fans. He said he was inundated with e-mails from fans wanting to know just what Jackson had planned for the concerts he would never give.\n\n\n\nAbove all, they said they were concerned about Jackson's three children. They said that they wanted to make a film that his kids -- Prince Michael, Paris and \"Blanket\" -- would be able to see in years to come that would make them proud of their father.\n\n\n\nThough the men acknowledged a heavy responsibility, there were light moments during the interviews.\n\n\n\nPayne and Bearden both smiled as they talked about working for the King of Pop and how he'd try to tell people what he wanted.\n\n\n\n\"I know you mean well, but ...,\" Jackson would say as he corrected colleagues, they recalled.\n\n\n\nBut all of them talked about he emotional toll that making this film has taken on them.\n\n\n\nThere were \"a lot of tissue moments on this film,\" Bearden said.\n\n\n\nWatch a former Jackson guitarist reflect on his career\n\n\n\nOrtega added that he didn't know whether he could handle the emotional stress involved in making this movie so quickly.\n\n\n\nUltimately, according to Ortega, the movie proved to be cathartic.\n\n\n\n\"I thought I'd collapse,\" Ortega said. \"I thought I'll never get through it, it's too hard, it's too soon, but in fact it was healing and helpful.\"\n\n\n\nHe hopes Jackson's fans will feel the same way.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Slave labor in developing countries such as Brazil, China and India is fueling part of their huge economic growth, according to a State Department report released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAmnesty International activists protest human trafficking during an event in Greece in March.\n\n\n\nThe department's annual \"Trafficking in Persons Report\" found increased allegations of forced labor made in connection with a variety of agricultural products and manufactured goods in developing countries.\n\n\n\nIn Brazil, the report found a \"trafficking phenomenon.\" It said thousands of trafficked and forced laborers had been found on plantations growing sugar cane for Brazil's booming production and export of the biofuel ethanol.\n\n\n\nThe report cites shrimp processed in Thailand and Bangladesh; clothing from Bangladesh, India, Jordan and Malaysia; and bricks made in India, China and Pakistan as being among the products of booming industries in which workers are subjected to forced labor, debt bondage and hazardous working conditions. Laws are not adequate to punish those responsible, it adds.\n\n\n\nChina was found to have a \"significant\" problem with forced labor, including forced child labor. Children as young as 12 are reportedly subject to forced labor under the guise of \"work and study programs\" and subject to excessively long hours, dangerous conditions, low pay and physical abuse. The report found China's growing brick industry is fraught with cover-ups of the problem.\n\n\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, China was put on a \"watch list\" of countries that could face sanctions if they don't improve their efforts to combat trafficking.\n\n\n\nIndia was also placed on the watch list for not doing enough to solve its trafficking problem, according to the report. While commercial sexual exploitation remained a problem in India, the State Department found internal forced labor \"may constitute India's largest trafficking problem.\" It said men, women and children are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, agricultural businesses and embroidery factories.\n\n\n\nOnce again, the report found U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf to have dismal records on trafficking.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman were listed as destination countries with widespread trafficking abuses. The report cites forced laborers trafficked from Asia and Africa who are subject to restrictions on movement, withholding of passports, threats, and physical and sexual abuse. The report found those countries made weak efforts to rescue the workers and prosecute the traffickers.\n\n\n\nThe other countries on the blacklist are Algeria, Myanmar, Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Moldova, North Korea, Papua New Guinea, Sudan and Syria.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A New York man authorities say once pondered changing his name to Osama Hussein to honor his personal heroes -- Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein -- remained jailed Monday on bomb-related charges in what police described as a plot to attack police, military personnel and postal facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice arrested Jose Pimentel, 27, on Sunday at the apartment of a confidential informant in the case when a video camera showed him drilling holes in pipes that would become the casings for bombs, according to a criminal complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel allegedly told police he was an hour away from completing his first bomb when he was arrested, according to the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pimentel's behavior morphed from simply talking about such acts to actions -- namely, bomb making,\" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile serious, the charges against Pimentel are a far cry from the mass-casualty attacks that have been al Qaeda's hallmark, and his case may reflect the weakened nature of the terrorist organization in the wake of the death of many top leaders, CNN security analyst Peter Bergen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If this is the big threat that we face, lone wolves using Internet recipes, we're in a pretty good place,\" Bergen said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel was arraigned Sunday night in a New York court on state charges of possession of a bomb for terrorism, conspiracy as a crime of terrorism, soliciting support for a terrorist act, being a felon in possession of a weapon and conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and arson, according to the criminal complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe planned to attack police officers, patrol cars and service members returning from service abroad, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The suspect was a so-called lone wolf, motivated by his own resentment of the presence of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as inspired by al Qaeda propaganda,\" Bloomberg said. \"He was not part of a larger conspiracy emanating from abroad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York authorities have communicated with federal authorities, but even though Pimentel's alleged targets were federal troops and facilities, his case will be handled in New York courts, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel's attorney, Joseph Zablocki, said the case against his client is nowhere near as strong as authorities say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As they admit, he has a very public online profile, and that flies in the face of everything that they've said,\" Zablocki said at the hearing. \"This is not the way you go about committing terrorist attacks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel, also known as Muhammad Yusuf, according to the criminal complaint, had a \"very active and very public online profile,\" prosecutors said. They cited the website TrueIslam1.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his arrest, Pimentel told police that he believes Islamic law requires Muslims to wage war against the United States, including assassinations, according to the criminal complaint against him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel's mother, Carmen Sosa, said her family is in shock over the allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm upset about what my son did, but on the other hand, he's my son,\" she said. \"I still love my son. I love the son I know, maybe a lot of people don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA neighbor, Simon Islam, said Pimentel was nice but \"didn't seem like normal.\" Still nothing stood out to make him or his wife particularly suspicious of Pimentel, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really shocking because I have two daughters in the building. It's like making me think that this is an unsafe place,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel's uncle Luis Saverino told CNN affiliate WABC-TV that his sister's son lived with him and that he had no idea what his nephew was up to inside his bedroom, which he always kept locked.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly said Pimentel is a follower of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical U.S.-born cleric who rose to become a top figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula before a U.S. drone strike killed him this year in Yemen.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe allegedly tried to contact al-Awlaki directly before the cleric's death, but never got a response, according to officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, the suspect allegedly decided to carry out the bomb plot, Kelly said. He \"jacked up his speed\" after al-Awlaki's death on September 30, according to the police commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We knew for the last two years, he's been reading a lot of jihadist information and talked a lot of inflammatory rhetoric,\" Kelly said of Pimentel. \"But it appears at this juncture the death of Anwar al-Awlaki motivated him and made him increase his tempo.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had also sought to visit Yemen for training, according to authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPimentel bought ingredients at Home Depot and other stores for the three bombs that he was working to make, mindful to shop around so as not to \"raise red flags,\" according to the police commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe allegedly planned to test an explosive device in a mailbox before using it against other targets. His aim, the police commissioner said, was to show there were \"mujahedin\" -- or Islamic militants -- in the city ready to wage \"jihad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the news conference announcing Pimentel's arrest, authorities showed a video of a car being destroyed by a bomb they built according to the instructions the suspect allegedly was following.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Bergen said it's not clear that Pimentel could have built a device that would have exploded with the same force, given that several would-be bombers failed to build devices that successfully detonated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Building a bomb from a recipe off the Internet doesn't mean you're going to build a bomb that does what we saw on the video,\" Bergen said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unemployed native of the Dominican Republican and a U.S. citizen, Pimentel had lived most of his life in Manhattan, except for five years in Schenectady, New York. Authorities had monitored him since 2009, and his extreme positions \"made even some of his like-minded friends nervous,\" said Kelly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commissioner said Pimentel even talked about changing his name to Osama Hussein -- in honor of his now deceased \"heroes\" bin Laden and Hussein, the Iraqi dictator.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe allegedly learned how to make a pipe bomb after reading an article entitled \"How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom\" in Inspire, an online English-language magazine published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue that came out just before al-Awlaki's death emphasized that al Qaeda supporters in the West should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was a reader of al Qaeda's slick online magazine Inspire -- and inspire him it did,\" Vance said. \"His stated desire to attack our servicemen and women ... could have come from an al Qaeda playbook.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN national security analyst Frances Townsend said it seemed odd that federal authorities were not involved in the case, particularly given the targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The feds may have been able to help here,\" she said. \"That being said, they had a successful arrest, and we'll see what we can learn from it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Deborah Feyerick, Catherine Shoichet and Hussein Saddique contributed to this report.",

Some have forecast growth as low as 5 percent.\n\n\n\n\"I will admit it will be a difficult job [to reach 8 percent]. This being said, I also believe with considerable efforts it's possible for us to obtain this goal,\" Wen said at a news conference following the annual session of the country's rubber-stamp legislature.\n\n\n\nChina has seen a sharp decline in demand for its exports since November as other major economies have struggled. In February, Chinese exports plunged 25.7 percent compared with the previous year's, Beijing reported last week.\n\n\n\nEven with the slowdown, China's economy -- the third largest in the world -- has gone from white-hot to merely robust. In 2007, China's gross domestic product grew at 13 percent.\n\n\n\nThe two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are in recession.\n\n\n\n\"So a lot of things will go down in 2009 globally,\" Dollar said. \"But we see China's contribution as being very positive in keeping many markets from going down as far as they would otherwise.\" The World Bank expects China's economy to outgrow most others in 2009.\n\n\n\nIn November, China announced plans to inject $586 billion (4 trillion yuan) into its economy to offset declines in industrial and export growth. That economic stimulus plan included the loosening of credit restrictions, tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending.",

The witness said he awakened Cummins, who screamed and ran to the living room, where he vomited next to the couch after noticing Williams' discolored face and cold skin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous night, Williams and Cummins arrived together at Barbour's house, Barbour told police. Once there, the three had drunk alcohol and snorted illegal narcotics, though Barbour could not identify the drugs, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Williams' family issued a statement through their lawyer Thomas Nichols that said, \"Dex had a very loving but trusting heart. Anyone who knew him would agree that he was easily influenced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHampton had identified Williams as Cummins' friend, but on Monday the lawyer said that -- heeding his advice -- the weatherman had not contacted the dead man's family.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo arrests had been made, but an investigation is under way, Lt. Jim Hansard said last week. \"We don't have a crime -- yet,\" he said. \"That's part of the investigation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas State Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channell said Monday that Williams' autopsy examination \"should be finished up,\" anticipating that a final report will be ready \"in the next week or so.\" After that, it will up to the local law enforcement agency overseeing the case -- the Maumelle Police Department -- to decide whether the autopsy results will remain confidential or be released to the public, Channell said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As thousands gathered Sunday in Washington for a march and rally focused on gay rights issues, lawmakers showed that some of the demonstrators' key goals face major obstacles ahead.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama speaks to a major gay-rights group Saturday night in Washington.\n\n\n\nEven with President Obama pushing Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act -- a stance he highlighted to one of the nation's leading gay-rights groups Saturday night, to huge applause -- members of his own party told CNN they're not in lockstep.\n\n\n\n\"I've said in the past I don't think that's the way to go,\" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, told CNN's John King.\n\n\n\nHe added, \"We can move forward on a lot of measures, but I'm not sure there's the support yet for that.\"\n\n\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, noted that her state is one of many that has a law prohibiting same-sex marriage. \"So I think, for a number of us, that becomes a challenge,\" she said.\n\n\n\nStabenow would not say whether she would vote to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\n\n\nThe law, signed by President Clinton in 1996, defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, and ensures that states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Clinton has since changed his mind, and said he no longer opposes same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nObama does not support same-sex marriage and has said he believes marriage is between a man and a woman. He does, however, support civil unions for same-sex couples that offer similar rights and protections.\n\n\n\nThe two Democratic senators on Sunday expressed support for the president's stances on several other key issues regarding gay rights, including legislation expanding the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill passed the House last week.\n\n\n\nBoth also expressed support for the president's efforts to end the military's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\n\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said he thinks the president will succeed on that front.\n\n\n\n\"I think he will and he can, but it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible,\" Levin said. \"Other militaries in the West -- the British and other Western armies -- have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully, but it ought to be done with thoughtfulness, with care and with a buy-in from the military.\"\n\n\n\nRetired Gen. Richard Myers, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, \"Gays can serve in the military; they just can't do so openly. And they do, and there are lots of them, and we're the beneficiary of all that.\"\n\n\n\nMyers did not weigh in on whether the change should happen, but said he agreed with Levin that the \"senior military leadership needs to be part of this, the Pentagon needs to be part of this.\"\n\n\n\nBut retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey disagreed. \"There's no question that it's time to change the policy. The key to it isn't buy-in from the military; it's for Congress to change the law. They ought to do so, and I'm confident that the military will move ahead on it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, rejected McCaffrey's suggestion. \"It's my belief that if you don't have buy-in from the military, that's a disservice to the people in the military. They should be included in this. I'm open-minded to what the military may suggest, but I can tell you I'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally,\" Graham told NBC.\n\n\n\n\"If this policy about 'Don't ask, don't tell' changes, it should be done based not on politics, but on reason.\"\n\n\n\nIn his speech Saturday night to the Human Rights Campaign -- the nation's largest gay rights group -- Obama praised the gay community for making strides in equal rights and pledged to deliver on major campaign promises that critics say he's left on the back burner.\n\n\n\n\"For nearly 30 years, you've advocated for those without a voice,\" Obama said. \"Despite the progress we've made, there are still laws to change and hearts to open.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that Israel must improve its relations with neighboring countries, saying the country is becoming increasingly isolated in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanetta made the comments ahead of his arrival Monday in Israel, where he will meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an effort to jump start peace talks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think there is any question in talking with leaders from Israel that they recognize that they've becoming increasingly isolated in that part of the world, and that's not ... a good situation,\" Panetta told reporters while en route late Sunday to Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think they recognize that it's important to do whatever they can to try to improve those relations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTensions in the region have been running high in recent weeks over the Palestinian Authority's bid for statehood before the United Nations, and Israel's plans to build 1,100 new homes in disputed territory in south Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The important thing there is to again reaffirm our strong security relationship with Israel, to make clear that we will protect their qualitative military edge,\" Panetta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As they take risks for peace, we will be able to provide the security that they will need in order to ensure that they can have the room hopefully to negotiate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPanetta said he plans to offer U.S. help to Israel to improve its deteriorating relationships with some of its neighbors, particularly Turkey and Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's pretty clear, that at this dramatic time in the Middle East when there have been so many changes, that it is not a good situation for Israel to become increasingly isolated. And that's what's happening,\" Panetta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think for the security of that region, it's very important that we do everything possible to try to help them re-establish relations with countries like Turkey and with Egypt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey and Israel have been at odds following the deaths of nine Turkish activists during an Israeli commando raid last year on the SS Mavi Marmara, part of a flotilla of ships that was headed to blockaded Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan expelled Israel's ambassador over that nation's refusal to apologize for the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic opposition in Egypt, meanwhile, against its peace treaty with Israel appears to be growing. Protesters last month attacked Israel's embassy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanetta will follow up his trip to Israel with a stop in Egypt, where he said he will encourage leaders to proceed with a promised election process following the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defense secretary said there was little question Israel has maintained its military superiority in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the question you have to ask is, is it enough to maintain a military edge if you are isolating yourself diplomatically?,\" Panetta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Real security can only be achieved by both a strong diplomatic effort as well as a strong effort to protect your military strength.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPanetta's visit to the region follows an Israeli announcement Sunday that it supports a call by the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia --\n\n\n\n\n\nfor direct talks with Palestinians to resume within a month.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Israeli prime minister's office said Israel \"welcomes the quartet's call for direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While Israel has some concerns, it will raise them at the appropriate time,\" the statement added. \"Israel calls on the Palestinian Authority to do the same and to enter into direct negotiations without delay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian Authority Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly said Palestinians would not return to negotiations until Israel halts all settlement construction and accepts 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanetta said he will stress to both Palestinians and Israelis that rather than set conditions for negotiating, they look for other approaches to resolve the issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So my main message is, to both sides, you don't lose anything by going into negotiations and trying to pursue a peace process everyone in the world is hopeful can begin,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on the agenda with Israeli leadership is Iran. Panetta said the most effective way to deal with Iran \"is not on a unilateral basis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, Panetta will head to Brussels, Belgium, for a meeting of NATO defense ministers. The coalition has been involved in a number of ongoing military campaigns, including over Libya and in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Guy Azriel and Michael Schwartz contributed to this report.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- James Bond would be lost without them -- those madcap gadgets merging two technologies that help him beat the bad guys and save the planet. The underwater watch with a built-in Geiger counter, for example; or the car that doubles as a submarine; or the exploding bagpipes and missile-launching wheelchair.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn artist's impression of what a Flying Electric Generator might look like\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a U.S. company has taken a leaf out of 007's book and developed a similarly unlikely \"combination\" technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"villain\" in this case is not a psychotic, cat-stroking megalomaniac, but something both more prosaic and, potentially, more threatening -- global warming: in particular, how to meet the world's energy needs without swamping the planet with clouds of atmosphere-clogging pollutants.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the madcap gadget that might just provide a solution? A helicopter that doubles as a wind turbine. Or, to give it its technical name, a FEG (Flying Electric Generator).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brainchild of Australian engineering specialist Professor Bryan Roberts, the FEG is being developed by San Diego-based company SkyWindPower.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode-cracker turned turbine enthusiast\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter is headed by David Shepard, who started his career cracking Japanese military ciphers during World War Two, and went on to create the Farrington B numeric font that appears on credit cards around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nShepard has long been convinced of the need for a new global energy source to reduce reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the last two decades his attention has focused on the electricity-generating potential of high-altitude winds, and when he learnt of Professor Roberts' prototype \"gyromill\" -- a flying wind turbine that the Australian had been developing since 1979 -- he decided it offered the best model for realizing that potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two men started working together in 2002, and the FEG is the result.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-altitude winds\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guiding principle of the FEG is that wind speed and constancy are far greater at high altitude than they are on the ground, especially in the two major jet streams - the Sub-Tropical Jet and the Polar Front Jet - that exist in each hemisphere (at around 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude respectively).\n\n\n\n\n\nA turbine at great height, so the theory goes, can generate far more power than a similar turbine at or near ground level. It has been estimated that capturing just one percent of the available energy of these high altitude winds would meet the electricity needs of the entire planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The winds a few miles above the mid latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are far stronger and more persistent than the winds just above us,\" Shepard told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This results in potentially being able to generate electricity for over eighty percent of the time, as opposed to thirty percent of the time at ground-based wind turbine sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The largest ground-based wind turbines currently produce about five megawatts each. We expect typical FEGs to produce about 20 megawatts each.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHelicopter technology\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how do we get a working turbine up to the necessary height -- at least 15,000 ft (4600 meters) above the earth's surface? That's where helicopter technology comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking the form of a giant H-shaped frame, the prototype FEG has four huge blades at the four points of the H, each blade 10.7 meters (35 feet) in diameter. These act like the rotors of a helicopter, lifting the FEG to the required height.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce in place, the blades not only keep the FEG air-born, providing lift like the surface area of a kite, but also act as turbines, turning dynamos within the platform that generate electricity, which is transmitted back to earth through a vast aluminum tethering cable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn in-built GPS (Global Positioning System) uses satellite technology to ensure that the FEG always remains in the same place, both vertically and horizontally.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Shepard, development is already at an advanced stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Professor Roberts demonstrated a FEG in Australia at an altitude of sixty feet over a decade ago,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. demonstration in three years\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We expect to make a demonstration in the U.S. less than three years from now at high altitude in normal high altitude winds. In four years I would expect this sort of technology to be in active use.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with ground-based wind farms, Shepard envisages whole \"sky-farms\" of FEGs hovering above the earth in restricted airspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nForty-three such FEG \"arrays\" -- each comprising 600 FEGs -- would, he estimates, generate sufficient electricity to power the whole of the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our calculations show that by reserving less than one four-hundredth of U.S. air space, located at relatively remote locations not on airway routes, all of America's electrical energy needs could be met,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is considerably less airspace than is already restricted for other purposes, primarily military.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only would the FEGs provide clean energy -- the feedback from environmental groups, according to Shepard, has been overwhelmingly positive -- but at less cost than conventional electricity generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile each FEG would cost an estimated $2,260,000 to build, maintain and support, arrays of FEGS would, in the long term, prove extremely cost effective, generating electricity at about 2 cents per kilowatt hour, as opposed to the 3-5 cents of conventional generating methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are risks, of course. Even in restricted airspace there is the possibility of collision with aircraft that unwittingly -- or illegally -- stray into that airspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, despite numerous design features aimed at ensuring the stability of the air-born FEG, the possibility of the structure malfunctioning and plummeting to earth cannot be excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrashes \"inevitable\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Inevitably crashes will occur,\" the SkyWindPower Web site acknowledges, \"Just as airplane crashes occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Statistically, however, FEGs should be just as reliable as commercial airliners, whose safety records are incredibly good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And FEGs don't take off or land at airports teeming with people in and around them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShepard and Roberts are not the only people to have considered harnessing the power of high-altitude winds.\n\n\n\n\n\nMagenn Power, a Canadian company, have been developing a helium-filled, medium altitude wind generator, while in the Netherlands Laddermill has been exploring similar ground using kite technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkyWindPower's FEG, however, is at the forefront of the field, with the U.S. government showing considerable interest in the prototype helicopter-cum-wind-turbine.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it will provide a definitive solution to the world's ever-increasing energy needs remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the effects of global warming and climate change becoming increasingly acute, however, a technology that might once have been dismissed as no more than a James Bond fantasy now looks as if it could have a serious role to play.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey might not be quite as sexy as your average Bond adventure, but flying wind turbines could end up generating a lot more heat than 007 and Pussy Galore ever did.\n\n\n\n\n\n.......................................\n\n\n\n\n\nAre Flying Electric Generators a crackpot idea?

  "context": "(CNN) -- Norman Ollestad remembers the tree limb.\n\n\n\nThe book's jacket features a picture of a 1-year-old Norman clinging to his father's back on a surfboard.\n\n\n\nHe was 11 years old, riding in a Cessna in a blizzard through California's San Gabriel Mountains in 1979, on his way to pick up a trophy he won in a skiing competition.\n\n\n\n\"The gray clouds were just pressing against the windows; it didn't even seem like we were moving,\" he recalls. \"Then, there's a limb reaching out of that fog and disappearing. Then another one and another one.\n\n\n\n\"Then realizing we were in the trees.\"\n\n\n\nThe plane crash that followed killed his father and the pilot and badly wounded his father's girlfriend, who with young Norman was tossed violently onto the top of an 8,600-foot mountain in the freezing, February chill.\n\n\n\n\"I felt three thuds. The third one must have knocked me cold,\" says Ollestad, now 41. \"I remember feeling those thuds in my spine -- a clear memory of that. Then I woke up who knows how long after.\"\n\n\n\nThe ensuing nine-hour, life-or-death descent -- in the end, he was the only survivor -- is the topic of \"Crazy for the Storm: A Memoir of Survival.\"  Watch the press conference that followed his survival \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut the book is about more than a plane crash, namely his relationship with an adrenaline-junkie father who basked in the wild life of Malibu in the 1970s and relentlessly pushed his \"Boy Wonder\" to excel from the ski slopes of northern California to the crashing surf off the Mexican coast.\n\n\n\n\"It's actually 100 percent about my relationship with my father,\" Ollestad said. \"That relationship was present on the mountain with me, even though he was dead.\"\n\n\n\nReleased this month, the book already has been picked up by Warner Bros. [a sister company of CNN] for a feature film and has earned critical acclaim, including comparisons to John Krakauer's 1997 nonfiction best-seller \"Into Thin Air.\"\n\n\n\n\"An engrossing story of adventure, survival and psychological exploration,\" wrote the journal Kirkus Reviews.\n\n\n\nIn the book, Ollestad cuts back and forth between the crash and journey down the mountain and the years leading up to that moment.\n\n\n\nIncluded are memories of life in Malibu, where he grew up the son of divorced parents in a cottage on the beach. There are surfers and skate rats, musicians and nudists and memories of smoking weed and spying on his neighbors' most intimate moments.\n\n\n\nBut mostly there's his father, Norman Ollestad Sr., an athlete, actor, lawyer, musician and former FBI agent. From the age of 3, Norman was groomed for competitive \"extreme sports\" by his father and pushed to be the best.\n\n\n\nThe book's jacket features a picture of a 1-year-old Norman clinging to his father's back as he steers a surfboard atop the waves of California's Topanga State Beach.\n\n\n\nHe acknowledges that many times, when his father was cooking up a new adventure for the two of them, he would rather have been \"riding my bike or eating chocolate cake.\"\n\n\n\n\"[At first] a lot of people are, 'Wow .. I had a lot of trouble with some of the stuff your dad was doing,' \" says Ollestad, who studied creative writing at UCLA and attended UCLA's film school. \"But then it turned out that a lot of that stuff was really beautiful.\"\n\n\n\nAnd he believes it saved his life.\n\n\n\nThe skiing made him aware of how steep the mountain's slope was and what it would take to get down it without falling. The skiing and surfing gave him control of his body and awareness of the exact movements required to work his way out of the descent's most treacherous spots.\n\n\n\n\"Some of it was sort of eerily, specifically perfect for the situation,\" he says. \"Forty-five degree pitch, blizzard with ice, well, I've been here for eight years doing this. It was familiar to me.\"\n\n\n\nThe book has had another, unexpected result for Ollestad, who now lives in Venice, California. He says he's been shocked at the e-mail from readers.\n\n\n\n\"Nobody's even written about the plane crash,\" he says. \"[They say] 'it reminds me of some of the things I did with my dad or some of the things I didn't get to do.'\n\n\n\n\"In every e-mail, whether it's a woman or a man, they talk about ...their relationship with their father or mother. It touches something in there where they want to talk about it.\"\n\n\n\nNow, for Ollestad, the story has followed him all the way around. He's the father of an 8-year-old, Noah, and seeks to walk the line between responsible parenting and teaching his child the lessons he says saved his life.\n\n\n\n\"Those were different times,\" he tells the boy in the book's epilogue. \"My dad made me do lots of things that I'd get arrested for making you do.\"",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Internet-based rip-offs jumped 33 percent last year over the previous year, according to a report from a complaint center set up to monitor such crimes.\n\n\n\nThe report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men.\n\n\n\nThe total dollar loss from those crimes was $265 million. That's $26 million more than the price tag in 2007, the National Internet Crime Center said. For individual victims, the average amount lost was $931.\n\n\n\n\"This report illustrates that sophisticated computer fraud schemes continue to flourish as financial data migrates to the Internet,\" said Shawn Henry, the FBI's assistant director of the Cyber Division.\n\n\n\nAmericans filed 275,284 reports claiming to be ripped off on the Internet, the highest number reported since the center began keeping statistics in 2000.\n\n\n\nThe dollar loss has been on a steady increase since 2004, while the number of cases referred to law enforcement has decreased steadily since that same year.\n\n\n\nComplaints to the center have resulted in several arrests, the center said, although information comes only from agencies that voluntarily provide the results of investigations.\n\n\n\nHenry said the figures show the need for computer users, in businesses and in homes, to be wary and use sound security practices while using the Internet.\n\n\n\nThe center said the top three most frequent complaints were about merchandise that wasn't delivered or payment that wasn't received, Internet auction fraud and credit/debit card fraud. Other scams include confidence frauds such as Ponzi schemes, check fraud, the Nigerian letter fraud and identity fraud.\n\n\n\nOne popular identity fraud scam used during 2008 involved sending e-mails crafted to appear as if they'd been sent by the FBI. Sometimes the scammers went so far as to say the mailings were from FBI Director Robert Mueller himself, according to the center.\n\n\n\nThe e-mails would ask the recipient for personal information, such as a bank account numbers, claiming the FBI wanted the information to look into an impending financial transaction. One variation of the scheme, according to the center, was to send an e-mail saying the recipient is entitled to lottery money or an inheritance and the funds can be moved as soon as bank account information is supplied.\n\n\n\nThe FBI has issued warnings about such scams in the past, and Monday's report included a new one: \"The FBI does not contact U.S. citizens regarding personal financial matters through unsolicited e-mails.\"\n\n\n\nThe report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men, and about half lived in either California, New York, Florida, Washington, Texas or the District of Columbia. More than 55 percent of those who filed complaints were men.\n\n\n\nBut the report noted that anyone who uses the Internet can be a victim, and that the ages of victims have ranged from 10 to 100.\n\n\n\nInternet crime offers unique challenges to investigators. The report said the offender and victim often live in different states and sometimes different countries, requiring multiple law enforcement agencies to cooperate and conquer any issues of jurisdiction. Another big problem is the anonymity of using the Internet. In most instances, a victim never meets the criminal.\n\n\n\nThe Internet Crime Complaint Center is a partnership of the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Valerie Gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in Europe as named by the Financial Times.\n\n\n\nShe runs global health and care organization BUPA and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues.\n\n\n\nCNN's Todd Benjamin spoke to her in London and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top. She said it goes beyond family issues.\n\n\n\nGooding: Women sometimes don't put themselves forward for things. And one of the things I think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job, the top job. They sometimes don't wish to compete or they don't think they're good enough for the next thing.\n\n\n\nBenjamin: Why do you think that is?\n\n\n\nGooding: Partly a lack of role models, partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family, in work. But also I think there is still -- I don't like to call it a glass ceiling, but I think there is still an unseen barrier for women, which is that, if you ask most business people, would they like to promote more women, they would all say yes, they'd love to: \"Where are these women, I want to promote them,\" will be the answer. But often they don't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job.\n\n\n\nBenjamin: And what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top?\n\n\n\nGooding: Well, first of all, to learn as much as you can and to make sure you've got the right experience, the right qualifications, and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction.\n\n\n\nBut I think another piece of advice I would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want, because I think one thing that happens with women, which perhaps is a gender difference, is that women often hang back and think \"I will be noticed for my results, everybody will see how great I am because I've delivered these exceptional outcomes\". But actually life isn't like that, you have to tell people about your results and your achievements, and men are often better at doing that than women are.\n\n\n\nBenjamin: What do you think separates good leadership from great leadership?\n\n\n\nGooding: Well, I think good leaders should be judged on their results. And I think of a good leader you should be able to say \"she transformed the business,\" \"she upped the performance,\" \"she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders.\" I think of a great leader I would go to that old Chinese saying, \"of a great leader the people will say \"we did it ourselves\"\".\n\n\n\nBenjamin: Do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men?\n\n\n\nGooding: No, I don't. In fact, I sometimes find these gender differences, when sort of represented in the business environment, are actually just not very useful. I think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and I don't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide. Because I have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial, and I've equally seen men who are very consultative. So, I don't just think it divides that way.\n\n\n\nBenjamin: You clearly love what you do. What is it about business that you think is such a buzz?\n\n\n\nGooding: It's the constant challenge, there's always something new, there's a new competitor, there's a new pressure, there's a new opportunity, there's a new challenge, I think that's what keeps us all going. I think it's the thrill of the chase, basically. E-mail to a friend",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Is cheese the answer for Cayuga County, New York?\n\nLarry Rosenbaum surveys the field where he hopes to build a high-end specialty cheese factory.\n\nLike small towns all across America, this agricultural community is suffering, with unemployment approaching 10 percent.\n\nEntrepreneur Larry Rosenbaum thinks he can do his part to turn things around. For a decade, the insurance man by trade has been dreaming of building a factory for high-end specialty cheese.\n\nOne key selling point: His product would meet the strictest standards of the Jewish and Muslim faiths.\n\nRosenbaum says the demand for kosher and halal cheese is high but the selection is slim. So he's been eyeing a plot of barren farmland between Aurelius and Auburn -- two Cayuga towns -- as the future home of a $40 million, 64,000-square-foot factory that would churn out feta and brie.\n\nThe goal is for his company, Saratoga Cheese Corp., to produce 30 million pounds of cheese in the first year and distribute it domestically and internationally.\n\n\"It's the beginning of a trend of bringing back manufacturing industry to New York,\" said Rosenbaum. According to the Public Policy Institute of New York State, manufacturing in New York declined more than 30 percent between 1997 and 2007.  Watch Rosenbaum talk about his plans \u00bb\n\nRosenbaum estimates that Saratoga Cheese Corp. would bring 75 factory jobs and 150 temporary construction jobs to the region. Plans also include 50 yeshiva work-study students to be placed on participating farms. In addition, several rabbis and imams would supervise production.\n\nIf Saratoga Cheese can get off the ground, it could mean a boost for local farmers like Dale Hemminger, who has agreed to supply kosher milk to Saratoga Cheese Corp.\n\nHemminger says it could be a crucial new market for his milk. And though he was at first skeptical of Rosenbaum's plan, Hemminger says he admires Rosenbaum's vision.\n\nBut that vision is still $10 million short of becoming reality. Rosenbaum has secured $30 million in government grants, loans and private funding, but needs $40 million before Saratoga Cheese Corp. can break ground. Given the recession, securing the final amount is proving no small feat.\n\nAccording to Bill Teator, a board member of Saratoga Cheese Corp., the best-case scenario is a combination of investment by a kosher dairy company and private lending. Teator says that though investors are confident about the business plan, the economic environment makes it tough to secure the needed cash.\n\nBut support from local lawmakers is abundant. Republican state Sen. Michael Nozzolio is optimistic that Saratoga Cheese Corp. will find a home in his 54th District. And with an estimated $140 million in local revenue hanging in the balance, there's reason to hope.\n\nRecession or not, Rosenbaum is steadfast in his belief. For him, it's not a question of if the factory will get built, but when.\n\n\"We're not going to quit until we make it,\" says Rosenbaum. It's a persistence that is necessary in a recession that has proved legendary.",

  "context": "New York (CNN) -- More than 80 Michael Jackson collectibles -- including the late pop star's famous rhinestone-studded glove from a 1983 performance -- were auctioned off Saturday, reaping a total $2 million.\n\n\n\nProfits from the auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York's Times Square crushed pre-sale expectations of only $120,000 in sales.\n\n\n\nThe highly prized memorabilia, which included items spanning the many stages of Jackson's career, came from more than 30 fans, associates and family members, who contacted Julien's Auctions to sell their gifts and mementos of the singer.\n\n\n\nJackson's flashy glove was the big-ticket item of the night, fetching $420,000 from a buyer in Hong Kong, China. Jackson wore the glove at a 1983 performance during \"Motown 25,\" an NBC special where he debuted his revolutionary moonwalk.\n\n\n\nFellow Motown star Walter \"Clyde\" Orange of the Commodores, who also performed in the special 26 years ago, said he asked for Jackson's autograph at the time, but Jackson gave him the glove instead.\n\n\n\n\"The legacy that [Jackson] left behind is bigger than life for me,\" Orange said. \"I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music.\"\n\n\n\nOrange said he plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity.\n\n\n\nHoffman Ma, who bought the glove on behalf of Ponte 16 Resort in Macau, paid a 25 percent buyer's premium, which was tacked onto all final sales over $50,000. Winners of items less than $50,000 paid a 20 percent premium.\n\n\n\nDarren Julien, president and CEO of Julien's Auctions, said people were hungry for such tokens of Jackson's life, as evidenced by the 3,500 who registered as bidders for the auction.\n\n\n\n\"Michael was very generous,\" Julien said. \"If you were friends with Michael Jackson or an important part of his life, occasionally he would give something away, and that's a very big reason that these things got out in the public.\"\n\n\n\nA signature black synthetic blend jacket from Jackson's 16-month Bad World Tour, his first concert tour as a solo artist, sold for $270,000. Featuring black straps with silver buckles and zippers, the jacket came to symbolize Jackson's \"Bad\" era.\n\n\n\nTori Renza, whose father bought her the Bad jacket when she was just 4 years old, said she grew up singing and dancing to Jackson's songs around her house.\n\n\n\n\"It just became part of our family,\" said Renza, who planned to use the money from the auction to pay back student loans.\n\n\n\nJackson's famed fedora, which he sported at the 1995 MTV Music Awards, sold for $73,800. It was one of three hats Jackson wore during a 10-minute medley before hurling it into the crowd.\n\n\n\nThe hat was auctioned at a charity event that year, and the letter of verification is signed \"Lisa Marie Presley Jackson,\" the daughter of Elvis Presley who was married to Jackson for nearly two years.\n\n\n\n\"To my knowledge, there were not a lot of letters that she signed with her full name,\" Julien said.\n\n\n\nHandwritten lyrics of the 1983 smash hit \"Beat It,\" which Jackson scribbled on a piece of white paper, went for $60,000.\n\n\n\nOne of the more bizarre items up for bidding, an upper mold used to fit Jackson with animal fangs for the 1983 video for \"Thriller,\" sold for more than $10,000.\n\n\n\nThe auction also allowed the world to see photographs of Jackson engaged in simple activities, like driving.\n\n\n\nHis 1985 Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL, which he ultimately gave to an aunt as a birthday gift, was auctioned for $104,500.\n\n\n\n\"What's even more significant is that we have photos of Michael driving the car,\" Julien said. \"When have you seen Michael driving a car? He was always chauffeured or driven.\"\n\n\n\nThere were also a number of autographed photos, as well as signed books, collectibles and artwork. Even Jackson's doodles and sketches of the likes of Frankenstein, Mickey Mouse and Charlie Chaplin were up for sale.\n\n\n\nLee Tompkins, a renowned pencil artist who said he came to know Jackson in the early 1980s and owns approximately 75 of Jackson's artworks, auctioned two of Jackson's pieces: one of a vagabond and the other of Charlie Chaplin. They sold for $20,000 and $33,280 respectively.\n\n\n\n\"He's more than just a singer and dancer. He was an artist first,\" Thompkins said.\n\n\n\nBefore Saturday's auction, the items were exhibited in Santiago, Chile; Dublin, Ireland; and Tokyo, Japan, where crowds lined up for hours get a glimpse of them, Julien said.\n\n\n\n\"Michael Jackson is looking down and has to be happy,\" he said after the auction, adding, \"We lost an icon.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A fledgling force of Syrian military deserters said it struck an important government security complex on the outskirts of the capital overnight, a bold strike reflecting the resolve and confidence of the regime's opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assault came ahead of an Arab League meeting Wednesday to reaffirm a decision to suspend Syria's membership, a move the group made over the weekend after President Bashar al-Assad's government failed to abide by a proposal to end a brutal crackdown on protesters.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Wednesday, France recalled its ambassador to Syria, the French Foreign Ministry said. The move followed attacks on French missions in Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defector group, called the Free Syrian Army, said it attacked an air intelligence base in Harasta and planted \"powerful explosions inside and around the compound that shook its foundations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said air intelligence has been deeply involved in the eight-month-long crackdown by the Syrian government against protesters, a grinding civil conflict that the United Nations says has left more than 3,500 people dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nTabler said the strike reflects the growing sophistication of the Free Syrian Army, which has brigades across the country and has been in existence since the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It opens up a new era of the conflict,\" he said, adding that the development represents \"a bad direction\" for the country. \"Until now, most of the protests have been peaceful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Free Syrian Army said it \"carried out special operations in various areas in Damascus in order to spoil the plan that the regime is preparing against our people and our homeland.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regime should \"take note\" that the deserter force \"is capable of striking them in any place and at any time we want,\" the group said.\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists said the deserter army used rocket-propelled grenades and the intelligence complex was damaged. Activists also reported damage at the complex in Harasta, an eastern suburb of the capital, Damascus.\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Syrian Army Lt. Abdullah al Odah, speaking to CNN in Istanbul, Turkey, called the late-night operation brief.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said 20 defectors armed with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles participated and that it involved people from inside as well as outside the security branch. He didn't know whether security forces suffered casualties but he said no rebels were hurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe called air intelligence \"one of the most terrifying secret service departments in Syria\" and said such security entities will be targeted by defectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This branch is responsible for many of the crimes against Syrian people and political prisoners,\" al Odah said. \"We will announce the whole story to the world in the correct time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was one of five actions reported by the opposition force, which has recently emerged as an important factor in the opposition movement as more and more soldiers have left the Syrian army.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition force also reported clashes with personnel loyal to al-Assad in several areas. They include Qaboun and Arbeen, Damascus neighborhoods, and Saqba, a suburb.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also fierce fighting in Douma, a city in the Syrian countryside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A clash between the Free Syrian Army and Assad's criminal gangs and his mobsters (the shabiha) in Douma, our Free Syrian military caused the Assad's gangs a lesson that they will never forget and heavy losses at the roundabout in the Douma municipality,\" the army said. The shabiha are pro-government militias.\n\n\n\n\n\nTabler said the Free Syrian Army consists of soldiers who've left their posts instead of obeying orders to fire on protesters. They've also had active operations in and around Homs, Idlib and other areas recently, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition groups like the Free Syrian Army have been calling on the international community to help protect protesters. They have urged the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone, as it did in the Libyan conflict, and a naval blockade. Army leaders have said such policies could allow them to establish a base of operations to launch a campaign to bring down al-Assad's regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group surfaced when seven military officers, believed to be original members of the Free Syrian Army, announced their defection in a video posted on YouTube in July. The group's leaders, who had been exiled to Turkey, say they're directing a guerrilla war effort against the al-Assad regime, which acknowledges an increasing number of deadly attacks on its soldiers, including a bombing of a Syrian army tank near Daraa recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nCol. Riad al-Assad, a 30-year veteran of the Syrian air force, claims to lead a force in Syrian cities of some 10,000 mainly low-ranking soldiers, a number impossible to verify. But the opposition fighters are believed to have little firepower -- planting bombs and carrying out hit and run attacks -- and they're a small force in comparison with Syria's military, which numbers in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group has a Facebook page, which calls on other soldiers to join it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arab League, meeting in Rabat, Morocco, said al-Assad didn't stick by his pledge to release detainees, withdraw armed elements from populated areas, and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and Arab League monitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe league has also called for unspecified sanctions against Syria and called on member states to withdraw their ambassadors from Damascus, a decision that will be up to each nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Syrian Arab News Agency, a state-run outlet, quoted a government source as saying that \"Syria decided not to participate\" in Rabat, where there was a ministerial meeting of the Arab League council and an Arab-Turkish cooperation meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the Arab-Turkish group that the Arab League's move to suspend Syria's membership was \"a responsible and well-timed step that put forth the gravity of the situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Syria hadn't fulfilled commitments to the league and the Turks to rein in the instability. A former ally of Syria, Turkey has threatened to cut off power supplies if Syria does not change course. Turkey's Energy Ministry said it has suspended negotiations with Syria over joint oil exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Syrian administration should read the message of the Arab League correctly, and by ending the violence it is inflicting on its people open up the way for the inevitable process of democratic transformation. It is not possible for any administration to win a struggle against its own people. It is not possible for an administration based on collective punishment and everyday killing people on the streets to be successful,\" Davutoglu said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Syrian administration must know that public opinion in neither the Arab world nor the world at large can bear these heart-wrenching images forever. Time is working against the Syrian regime. All of the credit and the helping hands that have been extended to the Syrian regime to date have been wasted,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final communique Tuesday from the Arab-Turkish forum \"emphasized the necessity of halting the bloodshed and violence against Syrian citizens, and the importance of taking urgent measures to assure the safety of civilians. The ministers stressed the importance of the stability and unity of Syria and the need for the resolution of the crisis without any foreign intervention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arab ministers also \"expressed their appreciation to Turkey for providing temporary protection on its territories for Syrian citizens who fled to Turkey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMohammed al-Ikhsafi, Morocco's ambassador to Syria, told CNN a demonstration occurred in front of his country's embassy in Damascus on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was some improper behavior in front of the embassy. The protesters threw tomatoes and rocks at the embassy and they brought down the Moroccan flag and raised the Syrian flag instead,\" al-Ikhsafi said. \"I asked them to send in a delegation so I can listen to their demands and what they were protesting against. I explained to them Morocco's stance in the Arab League and then they left. The demonstration is over now. No one was physically attacked or injured.\" Morocco's Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks on its embassy, the country's official news agency reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Arab Emirates denounced an attack on its embassy. A Western diplomat in Damascus told CNN in an e-mail that windows were broken there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Syrian government will shoulder the responsibility on maintaining the security of its diplomatic mission and the respect and safety of its staff,\" said foreign affairs undersecretary Juma al-Junaibi. \"It is clear that there was negligence on the part of the Syrian government in providing the necessary measures to ensure the protection of the UAE diplomatic mission in Damascus, and the protection of its staff.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, pro-government protesters attacked Arab and Turkish entities in Damascus, Aleppo and Latakia. The Turks have demanded compensation for damage to their buildings and they have evacuated families of diplomats and some nonessential personnel. On Monday, Syria's state news agency reported that Syria's foreign minister publicly apologized for the embassy attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Jordan's King Abdullah said this week that a person in al-Assad's position would step down, a statement observers interpreted as a call for the Syrian president to do just that.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, the Syrian government freed 1,180 detainees Tuesday as part of the Arab League peace plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut opposition groups said the gesture was too little, too late.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe death toll keeps mounting, they said, with at least 81 killed in clashes Monday -- making it one of the deadliest days of the uprising.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of civilians killed Wednesday was 20 -- 11 in Homs, 7 in Idlib, and 1 in each Daraa and Damascus suburbs -- said the Local Coordination Committee of Syria, a coalition of activists.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN is not able to independently verify claims of fighting and casualties because the Syrian government has restricted international media access to the country.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- When Katy Milane was asked to be in her college roommate's August 2007 wedding, she expected the bridesmaid dress to be simple and sporty, just like the bride's taste in clothes.\n\n\n\nKaty Milane, right, said none of the bridesmaids in her friend's 2007 wedding liked this hot pink dress.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't. Milane and five other bridesmaids wore hot-pink floor-length satin dresses. One wedding guest commented that they looked \"like a row of Pepto Bismol bottles.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't think any of us were happy with the dresses,\" said Milane. One bridesmaid had to be sewn into her gown when it ripped the day of the wedding. Another left her dress in a Cincinnati, Ohio, hotel room after the festivities had ended.\n\n\n\n\"We all tried to be very positive about it because the bride really loved them,\" said Milane. \"We would have worn anything to make her happy.\"\n\n\n\nSuch is the case at countless weddings. Bridesmaids are stuck in matching dresses that they will likely never wear again.\n\n\n\nSome say that brides choose less-than-attractive dresses for her attendants to keep everyone's attention on her. Whatever the case, there are plenty of women with bridesmaid-dress horror stories.  Check out some ugly bridesmaid dresses and pretty alternatives \u00bb\n\n\n\nKimberlee Norbury of Orland, California, was aghast at the bridesmaid dress her cousin chose for her saloon-themed wedding in July 2006. Norbury and three other bridesmaids were asked to wear \"saloon girl\" dresses purchased at a nearby costume shop.\n\n\n\nThe dresses, complete with lace garters and corset tops, were so short that some of the bridesmaids added fabric to make them longer. Even with the additional fabric, Norbury walked down the aisle with her bouquet strategically placed in front of her.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone knew what I was doing,\" she said. \"I can laugh now, but I was so horrified.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as the wedding ended, Norbury changed out of the dress. \"I was running for my clothes as fast as I could.\"\n\n\n\n\"Afterwards I did explain that I loved her very much,\" she said. \"That's the only reason I wore that.\"\n\n\n\nFreedom of choice\n\n\n\nChandi Brooks knows how expensive bridesmaid dresses can be. She's been in five weddings -- as a bridesmaid three times and the maid of honor twice -- and has never worn any of the dresses again.\n\n\n\nAccording to Conde Nast Bridal Media's American Wedding Study, the average price of a bridesmaid dress in 2005 was $138.20.\n\n\n\n\"It's money down the drain most of the time,\" Brooks said.\n\n\n\nThat's why she decided to let her bridal party choose their own dresses for her June 2007 wedding. Brooks' attendants picked black dresses that ranged from $20 to $100. The bridesmaids, all different sizes and ages, were pleased and so was the bride.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't have to shop around and didn't have to hear any griping. Everyone was happy,\" said Brooks.\n\n\n\nOther brides also are giving their attendants the freedom of choice. Celia Stangerone of Windsor, Connecticut, asked her bridesmaids to pick tea-length lavender dresses. The length and color were the only restrictions she placed -- the shade of lavender, style of dress and type of shoe were up to each individual bridesmaid.\n\n\n\nStangarone said she's close to her bridesmaids, which factored into her decision to let them choose their own dresses. \"I knew the type of personalities I was dealing with and I also knew that they were all different sizes and shapes,\" she said. \"I had to let them pick whatever style they felt beautiful in.\"\n\n\n\nThe final result was perfect, Stangarone said. Her bridesmaids chose dresses in varying shades of lavender that complimented each attendant's body type and skin tone. \"They all looked beautiful and were all really happy,\" she said.  iReport.com: See the bridesmaids' lavender dresses\n\n\n\nKeeping bridesmaids happy\n\n\n\nMany of those who lived through their own bridesmaid nightmares hope not to put their friends through the same pain.\n\n\n\nMilane, who remains friends with the bride, is not planning to have a wedding anytime soon. When she does she intends to choose a dress that her bridesmaids can wear again.\n\n\n\n\"I want my bridesmaids to like what they're wearing,\" she said. \"I feel like if you choose something they can wear in their daily lives, they're going to be a lot happier in the end.\"",

It leveled a church, sheared roofs off houses, overturned cars, snapped down hundreds of trees and plunged large swaths of the state in darkness as it toppled power lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same storm system that unleashed Saturday's twister delivered severe weather to other parts of the South on Sunday, with tornadoes hitting Alabama and South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, a tornado in Darlington County in northern South Carolina overturned as many as four mobile homes and toppled trees and downed power lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree people were hospitalized with minor injuries, according to Linwood Epps of the county's emergency management agency. He said that the local Cain Elementary school was damaged, with part of its roof missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Weather Service on Sunday gave the Mississippi tornado a preliminary rating of at least 3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale of 0-5, with wind speeds of up to 160 miles per hour and a preliminary path width of one and a half miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nWere you affected by the tornado?

There was a bomb.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said two customers were walking toward the door of his store when the tornado struck and that \"when they opened the door, it hit and blew me back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only thing that went through my mind were two things -- 'Please don't let anything else fall on me' and 'I hope my wife is OK,' \" Sullivan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest-hit counties were Yazoo and Choctaw, where assessment and rescue crews continued operations Sunday, though a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said there weren't any specific reports of people trapped inside the rubble.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities had recorded at least 681 homes damaged across six counties, according to MEMA spokesman Greg Flynn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency was reporting 33 injuries, but it hadn't received counts from Yazoo and Choctaw counties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but plans to do so on Monday. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were scheduled to arrive Monday, anticipating an application for a disaster declaration, Flynn said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 80 Mississippi National Guard troops, including 50 military police, had been deployed to Choctaw and Yazoo counties, MEMA reported. Forty highway safety patrol troops were also sent to the affected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of the state; four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson; and one was from Holmes County, also in north central Mississippi, said Flynn.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbour, who was in Yazoo City where his home is located, called the twister gigantic and said that \"in places (it) seemed to be to be several miles wide.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 38 people stayed overnight in shelters in Yazoo City, Flynn said, adding that most of the affected were able to stay with family or friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi residents shared stories of tragedy and survival on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could just feel the glass and debris flying in and cutting you,\" said Stacy Walker, who took cover in a hair salon in Yazoo City where she worked. \"It felt like minutes and minutes. but I'm sure it was just seconds the time that it lasted.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWalker made it out safe but later learned that a high school friend died protecting her children.\n\n\n\n\n\nDale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado. \"I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me,\" he said. His injuries: \"Three little scratches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all, 12 counties reported injuries, with some of the injured airlifted to a level one trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal coverage from CNN affiliate WAPT\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has \"been briefed on the tragedy in Mississippi and the situation is being followed by the White House,\" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide, said Mark McAllister, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the twister  had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi, starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Sunday morning, Alabama's emergency management officials confirmed a tornado touched down in Marshall County in the state's north.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least one mobile home park and some homes in Albertville were destroyed, said CNN affiliate WAFF in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Nancy Brooks surveyed the damage to her Albertville home, which was extensive. Part of home's roof was blown off, and debris littered the floors, which were now barely visible.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooks awoke to the sound of the incoming tornado, only to witness a moment later a large tree branch rip into her bedroom just feet from where she sleeps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm very lucky, I'm very fortunate,\" she said, as friends helped her begin the cleanup process.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the panhandle of Florida, Jeras said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN Correspondent Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.",

  "context": "ALSIP, Illinois (CNN) -- A Cook County cemetery where hundreds of graves were dug up and allegedly resold has been declared a crime scene, meaning that relatives of people believed buried there will not be allowed to visit for several days, an official said Friday.\n\n\n\nFamily members and police gather outside the Burr Oak Cemetery office in Alsip, Illinois, on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"It would be the height of irresponsibility for me to invite people in, to raise expectations and then crash them,\" Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart told reporters in a news conference held at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. He pleaded for patience, saying he hoped to reopen the 150-acre cemetery to the public in five to seven days.\n\n\n\nDart said the scope of the investigation has broadened to include \"Babyland,\" a section of the cemetery intended for children.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of women came up to me and asked for help with Babyland,\" he said. \"To a person, every one I talked to could not find any of their children in Babyland.\"  Watch sheriff discuss gruesome revelation \u00bb\n\n\n\nA large number of grave sites \"are completely missing,\" he said, adding that he had received more than 5,000 telephone inquiries and 1,700 e-mails about the matter since the investigation began.\n\n\n\nAs many as half of the complaints were about missing headstones, 25 to 30 percent were about loved ones who had been relocated, he said.\n\n\n\nHe cited the experience of one family looking for 10 relatives buried there. \"They couldn't find anybody,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn addition, in some cases there are no records of burials having taken place, despite relatives' insistence that they did, he said. In other cases, records have been altered, destroyed or found in people's houses, he said.\n\n\n\n\"Our office has to investigate over 5,000 grave sites due to the vast amounts of inquiries from grieving family members,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDart said he himself walked through the cemetery on Friday and what he saw was disturbing. \"I found bones out there,\" he said. \"I found individuals wandering aimlessly looking for their loved ones who can't find them.\"\n\n\n\nSome people told him that an entire area that used to have gravestones facing in one direction now has them facing in another direction, he said.\n\n\n\n\"This is getting bigger,\" he said. \"We don't have an end in sight ... more people have not found relatives than have found them.\"\n\n\n\nMore than 2,000 families have descended on the cemetery since authorities uncovered what they say was a scheme to resell the plots, excavate the graves, dump the remains and pocket the cash.\n\n\n\nFour people face felony charges for their alleged involvement.\n\n\n\nHe had said earlier this week that the number of disturbed graves was around 300, but said Friday that number was sure to rise.\n\n\n\nOne family arrived on Thursday to bury a woman in a plot they had purchased and found the plot was already occupied, he said.\n\n\n\nAuthorities also discovered Emmett Till's original casket in a dilapidated garage on the cemetery grounds. The casket had been replaced by a new one after Till's body was exhumed in 2005.\n\n\n\n\"There was wildlife living inside of it,\" Dart said of the old casket, found in the corner of a garage filled with lawn care equipment and other \"piles of things.\"\n\n\n\nTill was killed in August 1955 in Mississippi after the 14-year-old reportedly whistled at a white woman.\n\n\n\nHis body was exhumed 50 years later as part of a renewed investigation into his death. The Chicago Tribune reported that he was reburied in a different casket.\n\n\n\nThousands of people had viewed Till's body in the original casket in Chicago shortly after he was killed, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said at the news conference.\n\n\n\n\"His mother had the gut and grit to say that 'I want America to see what they did to my baby's body,'\" Jackson said about Till, whose body was mutilated.\n\n\n\n\"More than 100,000 saw his body lying at the church. It is said that those who saw his body were never the same again,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Emmett Till's lynching redefined emotions in our culture in very fundamental ways. So to see his casket in this state of desecration and neglect is very painful.\"\n\n\n\nCemetery groundskeepers told investigators that Till's grave was not among those disturbed in the alleged resale scheme, Dart said earlier this week.\n\n\n\nCarolyn Towns, an office manager for the cemetery; and Keith Nicks, Terrance Nicks and Maurice Daley, all gravediggers, have each been charged with dismembering a human body, a felony charge for which sentences range from six to 30 years, authorities said.\n\n\n\nSteven Watkins, an attorney for Towns, said his client is innocent. The public defender's office in Cook County said it had represented the three others at the bond hearing but could not provide a statement for them.\n\n\n\nAuthorities began investigating the cemetery -- where, along with Till, blues legend Dinah Washington and some Negro League baseball players are buried -- about six weeks ago after receiving a call from its owners, who said they suspected \"financial irregularities\" regarding the business, Dart said earlier this week.\n\n\n\nHe said the owners are not believed to be involved in the alleged scam.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The mysterious deaths of 21 prized polo horses Sunday at a club in Florida provides a peek inside the private world of a sport that generally is off limits to all but the very wealthy.\n\n\n\nThe Lechuza Caracas polo team may not recover from the loss of 21 ponies for years, a polo executive says.\n\n\n\nThe University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville and the state-run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando are conducting necropsies on the animals.\n\n\n\nInitial tests failed to reveal a cause, said Liz Compton, a representative of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Tissues, organ samples and blood are now being screened for toxic agents, she said.\n\n\n\nScientists have ruled out any contagious disease because the animals died so quickly, said state Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Fagan.\n\n\n\nAuthorities initially requested necropsies for only the eight horses that were insured, according to Sarah Carey, a representative of the veterinary school, which got the bodies of 15 horses.\n\n\n\nLater, the order was expanded to all 15 horses, she said.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Polo Association is among the parties cooperating in the investigation.\n\n\n\n\"In the meantime, we all mourn the loss of these horses,\" U.S. Polo Association Executive Director Peter Rizzo said in a news release. \"There are no words to describe the grief and sadness shared by everyone -- particularly the devastated owners of those magnificent horses.\"  Watch what investigators are studying \u00bb\n\n\n\nPlayers form strong emotional bonds with the horses they ride, said John Wash, operations president of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida, where the horses fell ill.\n\n\n\n\"I've heard a couple of polo players who were affected with this loss the other day, a couple of them I don't think have left their house since Sunday night,\" Wash said. \"There were a lot of tears there -- these big, tough guys just on their hands and knees, crying over what happened.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Open Polo Championship that was interrupted by the tragedy will resume Wednesday with semifinal matches, Wash said. Lechuza Caracas, the team whose horses died, was offered spare mounts from other competitors so they could remain in the competition, but the devastated team chose to withdraw, Wash said.\n\n\n\nThe Wellington tournament is one of the sport's three major championships, on a par with the U.S. Open in tennis or golf.\n\n\n\nAuthorities say they believe that the competition facility is safe for the other horses and that whatever killed the 21 horses entered their bodies away from the site.\n\n\n\nFifteen of the animals fell ill shortly before they were to compete Sunday; some died immediately and others lingered for almost an hour. Six others died overnight Sunday to Monday as they were kept in the same trailer in Wellington.\n\n\n\nAnimals are not kept overnight at the competition site, so no special precautions are in place regarding food, water or bedding, Wash said.\n\n\n\nOrganizers are planning a short memorial and laying of wreaths in honor of the horses, he said.\n\n\n\nGrief counselors are on hand at the facility to help employees deal with the trauma, Wash said.\n\n\n\n\"The scene can be described as almost like an airplane crash that involved not human life, but horses,\" he said. \"It was horrific.\"\n\n\n\nPolo ponies in the United States are not drug-tested, but the U.S. Polo Association has been considering taking up the practice for several years, Wash said.\n\n\n\n\"People are calling for reform, and maybe that needs to happen, but until toxicology reports come back, and autopsy reports, we don't even know if [Sunday's incident is] anything related to that.\"\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States has no record of abuse of polo ponies, but that may be a function of the sport's exclusive nature, society spokeswoman Holly Hazard said.\n\n\n\n\"We are learning about this, as is everyone else,\" she said. \"It may be that perhaps because it's not televised or not as popular as other sports, it's not something that either our constituents or our program is particularly focused on.\n\n\n\n\"But if there are either performance-enhancing drugs or some problem that is associated with this, we will investigate and we will offer a reward to bring whoever is responsible to justice.\"\n\n\n\nKeith Dane, director of the Humane Society's equine protection program, was en route to Florida on Tuesday to interview people involved in the incident and keep an eye on the investigation, Hazard said.\n\n\n\nNo evidence has been brought forth suggesting someone deliberately poisoned the animals.\n\n\n\n\"I guess everything's possible,\" Wash said. \"I've heard all different rumors. I don't know if I even want to go there and think about that.\"\n\n\n\nCompton, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services representative, said authorities have seen no evidence of criminal activity in the case.\n\n\n\n\"Clearly, law enforcement has gotten involved, given the complexity and the scope of the deaths, and they are fact-finding and gathering information, and once we have a specific cause of death, then they can determine where their investigation will go,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe devastated team, Lechuza Caracas, is one of the top teams in the world. The loss could set it back for years, Wash said.\n\n\n\n\"It's just like baseball or basketball or football,\" he said. \"You're taking years of grooming, training, nurturing to create, really, a first string of horses. And for four polo players, it takes anywhere from six to eight horses per polo player to play a game of polo. So if you're taking 21 horses, they're probably 21 of your first-string horses ... and you've just lost every one of your best players.\n\n\n\n\"It's not like you could just go out and buy 21 new horses and start at that point.\"\n\n\n\nPolo ponies are thoroughbreds, many of them former racehorses retrained for the game, but they cover a wide range of ages, Wash said. When they get too old to play, they are retired to pasture or stud, he said.\n\n\n\n\"A polo horse is treated quite well,\" Wash said. \"In fact, when you're a polo horse, you might play three months here in Palm Beach, you might take three months off, you might play another three months, say, in Argentina or England, you take three months off. They're not pushed 12 months out of the year.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Kim Segal and John Couwels contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Teams of rescuers in Haiti's capital rushed to the city's Caribbean Market on Tuesday after a machine used to clear rubble caused a secondary collapse, trapping at least one Haitian in the rubble.\n\n\n\n\n\nA French excavation team was working the site, which collapsed in the January 12 earthquake, said Lt. Col. Christophe Renou of French Civil Protection. The team spotted a body in the rubble and brought in an excavation machine, which resembles a bulldozer, to attempt to reach the body, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe machine tipped into a hole, however, and caused further collapse, Renou said. Several Haitians were in the building at the time, he said, some helping in the search and others looking for useful items. Teams are aware of at least one person alive, confirmed with radar.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenou said he believes more people are trapped, but he doesn't know how many or whether they are alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe French crews called U.S. and Mexican teams to the site to help with the rescue. The U.S. team brought more radar and lifting devices to try to extract the known survivor and reach any others, said Norman Skjelbreia, an incident commander from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rescue mission is complicated, he said, by the Caribbean Market's debris and rubble and an adjacent building that is partially collapsed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 212,000 people died in the earthquake, Haitian officials said, and bodies are being recovered every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescuers pulled an apparent survivor of the original quake, Evan Muncie, 28, from the rubble of a market on Monday. Doctors found him suffering from extreme dehydration and malnutrition, but without significant crushing injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuncie's family told staff at the hospital that he had been missing since the quake, and was found in the wreckage of a market where he sold rice. Muncie told doctors that someone brought him water while he waited for rescue, but sounded confused and sometimes thought he was still in the rubble.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Wednesday, Muncie was in stable condition, according to University of Miami hospital spokeswoman Nery Ynclan, who said he was more alert and aware of his surroundings and was answering questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYnclan said Muncie had eaten and even asked for chocolate -- which staff provided in small quantities. Muncie will be at the hospital at least another week, she said. His brother and mother arrived Monday at the hospital to be with him, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nYnclan also said that crews returned Tuesday to the the site where Muncie was found and determined he may have been trapped in a room with some food or water. He was likely not pinned down, she said, but scrapes on his hands and feet indicate he may have tried to climb out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ingrid Formanek and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- \"The Time Traveler's Wife,\" adapted from the 2003 best-seller by Audrey Niffenegger, is one of those gooey romantic mind-benders, like \"Ghost\" (which I adored) or \"The Lake House\" (not so much), in which a couple must come to grips with some trippy impediment to their relationship, such as life after death or a hole in the space-time continuum.\n\n\n\nRachel McAdams and Eric Bana star as a couple trying to connect in \"The Time Traveler's Wife.\"\n\n\n\nOnly instead of being milked for elaborate science-fiction thrills, the problem at hand gets treated as a weepy and grandiose inconvenience. Sort of like the metaphysical version of having a husband who takes too many business trips.\n\n\n\nHenry (Eric Bana) is deeply, and eternally, in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams), and she with him. The only problem is that he has a \"genetic anomaly\" that causes him to skip around through time without warning.\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden, he will melt out of the present and pop up ... somewhere else, in the future or in the past, without a stitch of clothing on, so that he must scramble for cover and regain his bearings. Then, just as suddenly, he'll pop back into Clare's life -- sometimes when he's too young a man to have any idea who she is. (A little confused? So was I.)\n\n\n\nMore jarringly, he sometimes appears when he's an adult and she's an adoring young girl standing in a pastoral meadow. That's when she falls in love with him -- which is meant to be innocent, but comes off as a bit unintentionally creepy. I mean, is the movie supposed to look like a contemporary version of \"The Lewis Carroll Story\"?\n\n\n\nTo muddle matters further, Henry is seen at assorted ages, but except for the moment when he shows up at his wedding with sudden streaks of gray in his hair, Bana looks exactly the same in every scene.\n\n\n\n\"The Time Traveler's Wife\" is built as a game that the audience learns to play, and after a while, yes, we do get the hang of it. That is, we accept the film's mixture of the playful and the slightly arbitrary; we become romantic time travelers too.\n\n\n\nAlthough the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote \"Ghost,\" the film's mood doesn't change very much; it's gentle, wistful, gauzy, and placid. Bana, so fantastic in \"Munich,\" has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the Aussie gym-rat version of Rodin's \"The Thinker\" can play a gentle, unassuming regular guy.\n\n\n\nBut he does nicely here. He and McAdams are sweet together, with matching dimples and starry eyes, and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place.\n\n\n\nIn the end, that's all there is to the movie, really. It's a time-travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat.\n\n\n\nEW Grade: B-minus\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly",

Read or listen to Dr. King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech. What were the points Dr. King was trying to make? What views did he express on equality? Why do you think that he chose to promote peaceful protest as a means to that end? What are your reactions to this speech? Share your thoughts with the class or write them in a journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. In the \"I have a dream\" speech, Dr. King says that he hopes that one day, his children \"will be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\" What does this mean? Create artwork, song lyrics or an interactive presentation that captures what Dr. King meant when he spoke of the content of one's character. Share your creation with the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Many people volunteer for community service projects on MLK Day. If you have ever been part of a community service project, share your experience with the class and talk about how the community benefited from the project, and what you got out of helping others. If you have never been involved in community service, consider what you could do to help someone else. Do you have a talent or skill, however small, that might help someone else? Elderly neighbors might appreciate your willingness to pick up their mail, for example. Another student might need help in a subject that you excel in. And if you are capable (and have your parents' permission), you might even consider being part of a bigger project, like landscaping around a school or painting a community center. Think about what you can do, not just on MLK Day, but on a regular basis to help your community be a better place, and then make a commitment to make it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nV.

  "context": "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Rapes targeting girls as young as seven are on the increase in Afghanistan where conditions for women are little better than under the Taliban, the U.N. and rights groups say.\n\n\n\nConditions for women are little better than they were under the hardline Taliban regime, the U.N. says.\n\n\n\nIn its annual report on human rights, the U.N. warned conditions were deteriorating in the war-ravaged country despite U.S.-led efforts after the 2001 removal from power of the hardline militia.\n\n\n\n\"Violence is tolerated or condoned within the family and community, within traditional and religious leadership circles, as well as the formal and informal justice system,\" said Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.\n\n\n\nThe \"Afghan government has failed to adequately protect the rights of women despite constitutional guarantees.\"\n\n\n\nWith a resurgent Taliban targeting NATO forces, government security forces and civilians, violence has been on the increase in Afghanistan..\n\n\n\nThe number of civilian casualties in 2008 totaled 2,118 -- the highest number recorded since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001, the U.N. said, urging greater protecting for ordinary Afghans.\n\n\n\nViolence against women comes in the form of rape, \"honor killings,\" early and forced marriages, sexual abuse and slavery, the report says. \"The security is the big issue,\" said Suraya Pakzad, founder of the Voice of Women Organization, which promotes education and awareness of women's rights and protects women and girls at risk in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"Because of security we, unfortunately, day by day, we have to pull out of areas where last year we operated, we have our operations. We were able to work with the women, but this year we cannot,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"We have to leave the area because security is getting worse day by day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Rapes in the country have been growing tremendously, particularly child rapes within the ages of 9, 8, 7, even lesser than that,\" said Wazhma Frogh, director of Global Rights Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"So these are the issues that are all born by this lack of security where women have no place in ... security decisions.\"\n\n\n\nDomestic violence against child brides is widespread, said Suraya Pakzad, the founder of the Voice of Women organization, who was married at age 14 and has six children. She said girls as young as 10 face \"violation\" by husbands 40 years their senior. \"By the end ... women, or girls, run away.\"\n\n\n\nBut women without husbands, especially widows, may have it even worse in Afghanistan, the report says. Without a spouse, the women are reduced to begging to feed their children.\n\n\n\nOptions outside the home are limited where the Taliban holds sway in Afghanistan. The Taliban's interpretation of strict Islamic law, or sharia, has included banning girls from school and the workplace.\n\n\n\nEven in areas not overrun by the Taliban, women face risks outside the home.\n\n\n\n\"The assassination of the most prominent national female senior police officer, in Kandahar in September 2008, underscores the tremendous risks faced by women in public life,\" the report says.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a new bill into law Sunday that will fine paparazzi for taking photos that invade a celebrity's right to privacy. The law also targets media outlets who purchase the photos.\n\n\n\nSinger Britney Spears' run-ins with paparazzi took center stage a few years ago when she took an umbrella to a photographer's SUV.\n\n\n\nThrongs of photographers often jockey to get the perfect shot of a celebrity, but that doesn't mean it's welcomed. Britney Spears famously had enough one night, taking an umbrella to a photographer's SUV.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Schwarzenegger himself had his car swarmed by paparazzi while he was picking up his child from school.\n\n\n\nJennifer Aniston received $550,000 and an apology from a photographer who used a high-powered telephoto lens to shoot her in the backyard wearing only panties.  Watch how stars impact paparazzi \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhile paparazzi may get a bad rap for their methods, celebrity columnist Ben Widdicombe said things are not always what they seem.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of times the shot you see in the magazine is actually orchestrated by the celebrity themselves,\" said celebrity columnist Ben Widdicombe. \"Celebrities like Britney Spears, for example, are infamous in the industry for letting their assistants tell the paparazzi when they'll be leaving the gates.\"\n\n\n\nCelebrity photos can be big business, especially when it comes to major milestones. Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher reportedly pocketed $3 million from OK for their 2005 union. Eva Longoria and Tony Parker received $2 million from OK for photos of their lavish Paris, France, wedding.\n\n\n\nExpectant celebrities can also rake in big bucks. People magazine reportedly paid $14 million for the first pictures of the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie twins.\n\n\n\nThe new California law makes it a crime to take and sell unauthorized photos of celebrities in \"personal or familial activity.\" Violators face fines up to $50,000. The anti-paparazzi amendment takes effect in January.",

His long, delicate eyelashes are closed as his head rests on a blanket.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10-year-old boy, however, is not asleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe turn of his gauze-wrapped head reveals a mass of blood. Maher al-Husseini is dead, reportedly from a sniper bullet.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe bled to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his own home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is the fault of this child?\" asks a man, whose voice rises in anger on a video posted Friday on YouTube. He kneels down and gestures to the boy, whose hands and ankles are tied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What did this child do that they hit him inside his house? This is unacceptable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday was a day of protest, pain and sorrow in Homs, a center of demonstrations and death in Syria. At least 17 people were reported slain in the city, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen, children and dissident soldiers were among those killed Friday in Syria, the group said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a brutal government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unidentified narrator of the video starts the tour of the home upstairs, pointing to a bullet hole on a window frame, then blood on the chair beneath it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe leads the cameraman down blood-spattered stairs to the body of Maher, lying in the family sitting room.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boy wears a maroon sweatshirt featuring a comic character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We could not aid the child, we did not know where to take him because of the firing in the neighborhood,\" the agitated man said. \"He kept bleeding for half an hour and we could not aid him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speaker blamed Maher's death on \"thugs\" who fired upon the home in the Mreiji neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother man sits in a chair, his head in his hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are not safe, this government is murderous,\" the narrator says. \"It is killing people, it is killing its own people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNear the end of the video, the man leans down and kisses the boy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the YouTube video. WARNING: Graphic content.\n\n\n\n\n\nA longer version of the video shows a woman crying over the boy. Others can be heard in background wailing. The boy is wrapped in a white sheet and carried by men in street towards a cemetery. Some of the men chant \"The martyrs blood will not be lost in vain,\" as the lifeless boy is carried.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the men walk towards the cemetery gunfire can be heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey get to the cemetery and start digging as gunfire continues to ring out.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother video posted on YouTube features another scene from Homs, a city wracked by eight months of violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree shrouded bodies are being carried into a mosque to be laid out alongside Friday worshippers. One is of a boy identified as Nasser Mohammed, 12.\n\n\n\n\n\nA chorus of voices rises as they are brought in. Some shout \"Allahu Akbar!\" (Allah is the greatest).\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN could not independently confirm what was depicted in the videos. Western networks are not allowed inside the embattled country.\n\n\n\n\n\nOut on the streets Friday, Syrian tanks rolled past the wreckage of past confrontations and gunfire echoed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe street battles and demonstrations come as the United Nations and the Arab League continue to press the government of President Bashar al-Assad to allow monitors or observers on the ground. The regime continues to resist those calls -- as it maintains the conflict is with armed terrorists and its own security forces and supporters are the victims.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a rare interview this week with a U.S. television network, al-Assad said he is not responsible for the crackdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nation's military forces \"are not my forces,\" al-Assad told ABC's Barbara Walters.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Jim Clancy reported from Beirut, Lebanon.",

In my opinion, it's silly to be proud.\"\n\n\n\nIt was a case of fifth time lucky for Haneke, who has previously been nominated for the award for \"Funny Games\" (1997), \"Code Unknown\" (2000), \"The Piano Teacher\" (2001) and \"Hidden\" (2005).\n\n\n\n\"There are always rumors at the festival, and one must not take them seriously,\" the director said. \"When I presented \"Hidden\" [in 2005], everyone was telling me I was going to win the Palme. And I didn't get it.\"\n\n\n\nJury president Isabelle Huppert, the French actress who won the best actress prize at the 2001 festival for \"The Piano Teacher,\" said she was delighted to have the chance to honor her former director.\n\n\n\n\"I think I always loved him as a director, and that's why I've worked with him before,\" she said at the post-awards press conference.\n\n\n\n\"To me, the movie is very philosophical. And his style, and his direction are totally ethical in my mind. That's what I wanted to reward.\"\n\n\n\nThe American actress Robin Wright Penn, who also sat on the festival jury, laughed off rumors that the decision was hotly disputed. \"There have been rumors circulating that we were fighting in the room,\" she told the press conference.\n\n\n\n\"The beauty about loving each other ... [is that] we could disagree, and we still love each other. I felt like we built a consensus among us,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"It was like being on \"Big Brother,\" except you could go to the movies,\" added British screenwriter and fellow juror Hanif Kureishi. \"Some of the films are very long,\" he joked.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Charlotte Gainsbourg won the best actress prize for her shocking turn in Lars von Trier's \"Antichrist,\" featuring scenes of genital mutilation that left audiences stunned.\n\n\n\nChristolph Waltz won best actor for his role in Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds,\" while Brillante Mendoza secured the best director gong for \"Kinatay.\"\n\n\n\nThe jury prize was shared by Korean auteur Park Chan-Wook's vampire film \"Thirst,\" and Andrea Arnold's \"Fish Tank,\" while the grand prix went to \"The Prophet,\" by director Jacques Audiard.",

  "context": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's government said Monday its forces had killed Tamil rebel chief Velupillai Prabhakaran as he attempted to flee, according to the country's state-run news agency.\n\n\n\nThe Sri Lankan government says Tamil chief Velupillai Prabhakaran is dead.\n\n\n\nThe Tamil rebel group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is aware of the government's report but has yet to confirm Prabhakaran's death or the deaths of its other leaders, according to a posting on the pro-rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com. It said \"initial reports indicate a determined massacre by the Sri Lanka Army.\"\n\n\n\nPrabhakaran was one of 19 senior LTTE leaders that the government has identified among the bodies found as its troops completed mop-up operations after routing the Tigers, the defense ministry said.\n\n\n\nThe leaders include Prabhakaran's eldest son, Charles Anthony, as well as Pottu Amman, LTTE's intelligence leader, according to the ministry.\n\n\n\nPrabhakaran founded the rebel group, which has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries. It pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the explosive suicide belt.\n\n\n\nIt was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so.  Watch more on the possible end of fighting \u00bb\n\n\n\nPrabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu as he campaigned for a second term. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\nTwo years later a Tigers suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally.\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, the militants offered to \"silence\" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, pushed them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land.\n\n\n\nIf the rebels honor their pledge, it would potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia.\n\n\n\nPrabhakaran's supporters considered him a hero with a single-minded focus -- to fight for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with a disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime.\n\n\n\nIn the past it has been reported he wore a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow and kill himself rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive.\n\n\n\nSri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to announce that \"military operations\" against the Tiger rebels have ended in an address to parliament and country on Tuesday.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe rebels have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983.\n\n\n\nJournalist Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.",

The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,\" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. \"We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,\" Suppiah said. \"We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix \"Mc\" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the \"Mc\" in McCurry stands for \"Malaysian Chicken Curry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,\" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: \"Tasty and so Gooood.\"",

  "context": "(Mashable) -- It was speculative before given the lack of independent confirmation, but now apparently Apple has gone on record to confirm that the original deal signed with AT&T for iPhone exclusivity back in 2007 was a five-year deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means at least some legal hoops would need jumping through if we're ever going to see that oft-rumored Verizon iPhone before 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngadget reports that court documents filed by Apple in a California class-action suit confirm the original AT&T exclusivity deal had a five-year duration. The suit, ongoing since 2007, claims that Apple and AT&T were exerting a monopoly over iPhone service by surreptitiously locking iPhone buyers into renewing contracts with AT&T once their initial two years was up.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flip side, there are a number of reasons such a contract might be amended or canceled, so it's not exactly a total given that the iPhone won't appear on another carrier before 2012. But given the original terms, it could require some tricky negotiation or legal fancy footwork to get there.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the class-action suit also alleges an illegal monopoly over the iPhone App Store, which the court ruled substantial enough to move forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn both fronts then -- consumer market and legal proceedings -- it will be fascinating to watch for further details on when the AT&T iPhone exclusivity curtain might drop or even be forcibly struck down.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think we'll see the iPhone come to another carrier before 2012?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2010 MASHABLE.com.

  "context": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- \"In Afghanistan, the sacrifice in the political game is women and children,\" female Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi said.\n\n\n\nCritics say they fear that Afghanistan's new Shiite law will set the nation backward.\n\n\n\nKoofi says that is exactly what happened when the Afghan parliament recently passed a bill intended to give the minority Shia community their own identity. But critics say the latest draft strips Shia women of rights as simple as leaving the house without permission from a male relative and as extreme as allowing a man to have sexual intercourse with his wife even when she says, \"No.\"\n\n\n\nThese critics wonder how what amounts to rape in marriage could be passed by parliament and signed into law by President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\n\nAmid blistering criticism from the West, Karzai addressed the law over the weekend, saying that key elements of the bill were misinterpreted by Western news organizations.  Watch Karzai react to controversial law \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"We understand the concerns of our allies and the international community. Those concerns may be due to an inappropriate, not-so-good translation of the law, or misinterpretation,\" Karzai told reporters in Kabul.\n\n\n\nHe added that the Minister of Justice will study the \"Shia state law,\" line by line, to make sure it follows the nation's constitution, which requires equal rights to both sexes.\n\n\n\n\"If there is anything that is of concern to us, then we will definitely take action in consultation with our [religious clerics] and send it back to the parliament. You be assured of that. This is something that we're also serious about and should not allow,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Karzai did not address the most controversial part of the bill, dealing with rape of a wife.  Watch a report on the law \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe Shia state law was debated by 249 members of the lower house, including 68 women, some of whom voted for the bill. It was then sent to the upper house. Even some lawmakers are baffled at the manner in which it passed.\n\n\n\n\"Most members of the parliament did not know what they were going to vote for,\" Koofi said. \"Even some of my friends, MPs sitting with me, voted in favor without knowing what happened.\"\n\n\n\nU.S. President Obama called the law \"abhorrent\" and said his administration has made it clear to the Karzai government that it objects to the law. Human rights groups and the international community have condemned the law and say it could undermine efforts to support basic human rights in the war-torn nation.\n\n\n\n\"We very much hope that the draft piece of legislation is to be withdrawn,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a NATO summit on Afghanistan over the weekend. \"It is unacceptable if such a law were to be passed in Afghanistan and become a part of Afghan legislation.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to lawmakers who opposed the bill, conservative legislators are pushing back any progress made for women's rights in Afghanistan after the brutal oppression under the Taliban regime.\n\n\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, under the Sunni fundamentalist government of the Taliban, women were not allowed to leave their homes without being escorted by a male relative, and girls were not allowed to go to school.\n\n\n\nWhen women did leave their homes, they were required to wear a blue burqa, which covered their bodies from head to toe. The only opening was a small net that provided an eyehole for the women to see through.\n\n\n\nWomen remember those days with despair.\n\n\n\nOne female teacher, who asked not to be named, said that during the Taliban regime, she was stopped at the market by the Taliban and beaten with a whip. Her crime: She wore a shawl covering her body instead of a burqa. She says she was too poor to purchase a real burqa.\n\n\n\nAfter that beating, she was stuck in her home for months until someone was able to give her a used burqa. But even then, she didn't know how to function wearing the suffocating fabric.\n\n\n\n\"I remember stepping out of a taxi with my son, and my foot was caught inside the burqa, making me fall out of the taxi onto mud. And everyone started laughing. It was humiliating,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWomen in Afghanistan can still be seen wearing burqas. But Koofi says advances have been made for women's rights in recent years. In some cases, it's as simple as putting on makeup and walking down city streets.\n\n\n\nBut she fears that the rights of women and children could slowly be eroded, the \"victims of political games,\" as she puts it. \"I mean, they don't have a gun to fight [with], they cannot create a mess,\" Koofi said.\n\n\n\nThat's a sentiment echoed by rights groups. \"The reported new law on women's rights could be about to seriously undermine women's rights for millions of Afghanistan women,\" Amnesty International said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe new law was intended to give the minority Shia community its own identity within the predominantly Sunni country. Shias have been practicing their form of Islam for centuries in Afghanistan, but they agree that there needs to be a governing Islamic law for Shias alone, one recognized by the central government.\n\n\n\nKoofi welcomes international support in fighting the new law, telling CNN that international investments in Afghanistan should go beyond financial donations.\n\n\n\n\"I don't ask that the international community come and make laws for us, but they have to make the government of Afghanistan accountable for their commitment to women and children ... and basically the human rights situation in this country,\" she said.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson has officially become the most popular person on Facebook, with more than 7 million fans on the social networking site.\n\n\n\nThe Michael Jackson Facebook page is now the most popular on the social networking site.\n\n\n\nPreviously, the most popular person on Facebook, with just over 6 million fans, was U.S. President Obama.\n\n\n\nOver the past week, Jackson's page has grown from 80,000 fans to just over 7 million, generating the largest response on a Facebook page, the social networking site says.\n\n\n\nHe has continued to gain about 20 fans per second and even more during peak traffic hours, said social media commentator Nick O'Neill, founder of the Social Times Web site.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, actor Ashton Kutcher recently entered a race to beat CNN's Larry King to 1 million followers on Twitter. Kutcher won and remains the most popular person on Twitter -- but still has only 2.6 million followers.\n\n\n\nDuring his memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, all 10 trending topics on Twitter.com were Jackson-related.\n\n\n\nJackson's popularity and the viral nature of Facebook fan pages are the primary reasons for the huge fan base, O'Neill explained.\n\n\n\nHe said, \"It's simply his popularity. Also, as users become fans, the page gets recommended to others, driving the viral growth of the page.\n\n\n\n\"Michael Jackson is simply the largest celebrity in the world. While he was a controversial figure, he clearly attracts the attention of the global media,\" he continued.\n\n\n\nThe Facebook page has become an online memorial to Jackson, with thousands of comments from around the world; dozens appear every minute.\n\n\n\nFree virtual versions of Jackson's famous glove are the most popular gift on the site, with more than 800,000 sent to members.\n\n\n\nThe huge following leaves the singer's heirs (and his record label) with a massive network to communicate with fans and continue the massive resurgence of interest in Jackson's music, O'Neill said.\n\n\n\n\"While Sony has not heavily engaged the fan base on Michael Jackson's page, they at least have a presence. If your fans are there, you should be there.\n\n\n\n\"This also provided an ongoing promotional channel for any future products that are released. It's simply not an option and will become a component of all marketing strategies.\"\n\n\n\nThere have been 2.6 million downloads of Jackson's music since his death. He has the top two albums on iTunes, as well as three of the top 10 singles.\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Jackson held 11 of the top 200 album positions and 43 of the top 200 singles, based on sales monitored by the Official Charts Co. for the week ended June 27.\n\n\n\nHis \"Number Ones\" album topped the OCC album chart after selling 46,400 physical copies and 10,000 downloads.\n\n\n\nThe surge for demand in Jackson's music looks likely to continue for several months: The fan page has a music player with some of Jackson's hits and an option to buy them through Amazon.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Going into the eighth season finale of \"American Idol,\" Adam Lambert looks like the favorite against competitor Kris Allen. But should Lambert even be on the show, since he has performed professionally in the national Broadway tour of \"Wicked\"?\n\n\n\nFormer 'American Idol' runner-up Diana DeGarmo says it's getting harder for the average person to get on the show.\n\n\n\nDiana DeGarmo, runner-up in the third season of \"American Idol,\" spoke with HLN's Mike Galanos on Prime News about whether or not an amateur stands a chance on the show.\n\n\n\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\n\n\nMike Galanos: What were the stipulations as to your past history before you joined \"American Idol\"? How much could you do before they'd say, \"You aren't an amateur anymore. You're more of a professional\"?\n\n\n\nDiana DeGarmo: Each contract for each show has gotten a little stronger and a little stronger. Prior to me doing \"American Idol,\" I had done things like theater, but at that point nowhere near on a professional level.\n\n\n\nThe cool thing is they keep it fair by having little things in the contract about how you can't release a record nationally with a record label -- things like that. But people who have been signed prior can, of course, be on the show.\n\n\n\nGalanos: Do you think the \"rags-to-riches\" story is lost and we are going to get more and more people who have more and more experience?\n\n\n\nDeGarmo: I think people now realize that \"American Idol\" is such a launching spot for anyone's career. People that maybe would have not done it a few years ago, saying, \"Oh, I'm too professional,\" maybe take a little bit of a second glance at the show because they realize it's such a launching pad. But I do think it's a little harder for the everyday Joe to get in it.\n\n\n\nGalanos: Do you think Adam has an unfair advantage since he was an understudy for the Broadway tour of \"Wicked\"?\n\n\n\nDeGarmo: Not really, because it's all about performing. So it's just about what you are doing at that exact moment up there on the \"American Idol\" stage. I think Kris and Adam are just two totally different performers, but I think they are pretty even when it comes down to the end of the day.",

That's where World Tour Finals tournament director Chris Kermode and his team come in.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Federer make World Tour Finals history?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The build time that we have is very short,\" Kermode told CNN. \"Rihanna was here on Tuesday night until midnight and we moved in at 1am in the morning on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had two days to turn the O2 Arena from probably the greatest music venue in the world into the greatest sporting venue in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe electric blue court, neon digital displays and dazzling lights give the 17,500 fans packed into the O2 an experience which is poles apart from the regal aura which surrounds the grass courts of Wimbledon -- located just 10 miles away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The O2 is pretty much a music venue,\" explains Kermode. \"Laying the court might sound quite basic but it's actually quite time consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We stage it in a very different way. So there's big screens, there's light shows, lots of digital boarding around the court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We build a 7,000 square meter fanzone, we also build a sponsors village with a practice court in the middle. So there's a lot to do in a very short space of time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe work done transforming the O2 is certainly appreciated by the fans who flock to the week-long tournament. The 2010 event saw over 250,000 spectators come to see the action across the seven days of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nTennis fan Thav Phouthavong was taking in the action on Thursday and was struck by the transformation the venue had undergone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's my first time here at the O2 (watching tennis) but I've been to music gigs here,\" he said. \"It's completely transformed with the tennis memorabilia, practice courts and fan zones. Normally it's an empty space.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish spectator Luis Rodriguez was also impressed with the arena, saying it surpassed previous tennis experiences in his homeland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's my first time here,\" he said. \"I've been to the Barcelona tournament before, I prefer this. The size of the O2 is a lot bigger and better. They've got restaurants, it's really spacious and there's a lot more to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the event moving to London in 2009, Shanghai served as the location for what was then called the Tennis Masters Cup. Kermode explained how the timing was perfect for the O2 to take on the mantle from the Chinese city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The chairman of the ATP was looking where to take it from Shanghai and decided bringing it to the UK, and London, was a good move. The O2 was just about to be opened; it was a perfect synergy to match the two together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to giving tennis a futuristic face-lift, Kermode also believes hosting the World Tour Finals at a venue such as the O2 opens the sport up to a wider audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where the O2 has been so successful is the acts that they've had over the years has made this venue a destination venue in it's own right,\" he said of the arena which has been converted from the Millennium Dome attraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what we've managed to create here is almost attracting a new audience to tennis that historically maybe couldn't get tickets to Queens and Wimbledon. People who had maybe never seen live tennis before. So we've got the core tennis fans and we've got sporting fans who are seeing the game for the first time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNeil Harman is the tennis correspondent for British newspaper The Times. He is full of praise for the show put on by the O2, saying the way in which tennis has flourished at the arena is reminiscent of when the finals were played at New York's Madison Square Garden between 1977 and 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To my mind it's a very natural venue for tennis, much like Madison Square Garden was in terms of an indoor venue,\" said Harman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way it's set up, the way the tennis court itself is spot-lighted ... There are certain places you feel tennis was made for and I think this is definitely one of them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarman is also convinced the event is creating new fans for the sport, with tickets more obtainable than they are for one of the tennis' four grand slams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Very few people get to go to Wimbledon. Here, there's more of a sense of the general population getting in and being able to feel the pulse of the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To get that close to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal is something special. The whole thing is designed to draw people into the sport and I think that's what we need to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a surprise to me that places like Madison Square Garden, like the O2, although they are ostensibly concert venues, with a bit of imagination, a bit of thought and a bit of foresight, can be transformed into great sporting venues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe O2's deal to host the World Tour Finals expires in 2013, with the ATP yet to make a decision on where the event will move onto next.\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever the tournament ends up, Harman believes the O2 Arena has raised the bar and helped increase tennis' global profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's setting a benchmark; the next venue has got to step up. When it moves from here, and I'm sure it will because the message of tennis has to be global, it's going to be a very tough act to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everywhere across the world we have to portray the message that tennis is a superb sport to come and watch, but very few do it as well as this.\"",

Instead, Mrs. Obama has defined with remarkable acuity what flatters a tall, broad-shouldered and curvaceous working woman who knows exactly who she is and where she is going.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an enviable eye for color and layering, she has fashioned a riveting parade of on- and off-the-shoulder dresses, cardigans, cinched trenches, leggings, wide-legged trousers and full skirts, working them in intense florals or unexpected hues such as chartreuse and emerald. InStyle.com: Michelle Obama's first 100 Days of style\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, like every woman who gets a kick out of dressing up, she knows the power of accessories -- a cool flat boot, a wide belt, a statement necklace.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thrilling result? Women across this country (and the world) are exclaiming almost daily, \"Look at that print! I love that color! Where can I get that sweater?\"  Watch how the first lady has become a style icon \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, not only does our first lady proudly stride with the confidence and warmth of a modern American woman, but the wardrobe she steps out in boasts relevance, comfort, and -- dare we say it? -- sex appeal. InStyle.com: Try on Obama's hairstyle\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fashion industry may have occasionally sniped, but come on, does anyone really give a damn if it's appropriate to wear a cardigan to meet the queen?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does count is that each time we've caught that man of hers watching her walk into a room during their first 100 days, we have witnessed both a dynamic new first couple -- and a wife whose husband unashamedly only has eyes for her. The clothes are cool, but even better is the fact that Michelle Obama has brought romance back to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- Late last month, Michelle Russell somberly walked on a Maui beach in Hawaii to mark her daughter Sarah Skiba's 20th birthday.\n\n\n\nSarah Skiba visited her father, Paul Skiba, every other weekend.\n\n\n\nFor Russell, who last saw Sarah more than a decade ago, when she was just 9 years old, some images will never fade with the passage of time.\n\n\n\nRussell especially recalls the cold Friday morning in February 1999 when she dropped Sarah off at a bus stop in Westminster, Colorado, for her ride to school.\n\n\n\n\"She loved to go to school,\" Russell said, remembering that Sarah ran for the bus and slipped on ice.\n\n\n\n\"She skinned her wrist at the bottom of her hand, and she was crying,\" Russell said. \"I had a first aid kit and gave her a Band-Aid.\"\n\n\n\nAfter school that day, Sarah's father, Paul Skiba, met Sarah to spend the weekend together, a visitation arrangement in place since Russell and Skiba divorced several years earlier.\n\n\n\n\"Her father picked her up at 3:30 p.m.,\" Russell said. \"She visited her father every other weekend.\"\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Sarah joined her father -- who owned a moving company -- and his employee Lorenzo Chivers as they went to a moving job.  Watch a report about the case \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"We know they had two moving jobs that day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon,\" said Thornton Police Department Sgt. Pat Long, the original investigator on the case.\n\n\n\nThe second job was for a man who lived in Morrison, Colorado.\n\n\n\nThe girl, her father and Chivers left Morrison between 5 and 5:30 p.m. to return the moving truck to the Westminster parking lot where Skiba stored his vehicles, Long says.\n\n\n\nOn the way, a 12-year-old relative of Paul Skiba's girlfriend, Theresa Donovan, received a call from Sarah.\n\n\n\nThe girl said they were on their way to return the truck and would then come home.\n\n\n\nBut Sarah and her father never made it back to the house he and Donovan shared.\n\n\n\nMichelle Russell later called police, who initially thought it was a parental abduction, even though Chivers was also missing.\n\n\n\n\"It was almost three weeks after that that I became involved,\" Long said. \"I think we lost some key evidence during the initial time that passed at the scene.\"\n\n\n\nPaul Skiba's family and friends went to his truck storage lot one week after the girl and the two men went missing and grew suspicious when they found what they believed were two bullet holes in the exteriors of Skiba's moving trucks, Long said.\n\n\n\nThey also noticed that Skiba's only functioning truck was not parked quite the way he would have done it himself.\n\n\n\n\"Paul was adamant that the moving truck always be parked in a certain position, and the way it was found was pulled nose-in and not back-in,\" Long said.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone knows he was anal about the way that truck was parked.\"\n\n\n\nSuspected ambush\n\n\n\nLong said he thinks there was an attempt to disguise the scene to make it appear that the victims had come back to the lot and left.\n\n\n\nInvestigators from the Thornton Police Department CSI, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the Westminster Police Department confirmed that bullets had, in fact, pierced Skiba's trucks.\n\n\n\nThey also identified blood spatter on the two trucks and blood inside the cab of the truck used in the move. Hair attached to a piece of scalp was found on the hood of Skiba's moving truck, and additional hair was on the truck's fender.\n\n\n\nDNA tests revealed that blood on the ground belonged to Paul and Sarah Skiba. The piece of scalp belonged to Paul. The hair was Sarah's.\n\n\n\n\"The pool of blood on the ground looked like motor oil that had spilled,\" Long said.\n\n\n\nAuthorities believe that the three were ambushed and killed when they returned the truck to the lot. Police think their bodies were put in the back of Skiba's moving truck, driven to another location and dumped.\n\n\n\nChivers may have been forcibly taken from the lot and then murdered or killed at the lot in a manner that would have produced no evidence, according to police.\n\n\n\nNo bodies were ever found, leaving police to suspect that Chivers was also a victim.\n\n\n\n\"We did have a witness who saw the truck come back to the lot,\" Long said.\n\n\n\nThe truck's loading ramp, moving blankets and straps were also missing.\n\n\n\nChivers' and Skiba's personal cars, which they had left at the lot during their Sunday moving jobs, were parked at separate apartment complexes across Denver. Investigators were never able to make a direct link between the victims and those buildings.\n\n\n\nSkiba was the likely target, they say, and Sarah and Chivers were bystanders.\n\n\n\nPolice have interviewed as many as 80 people, but no arrests have been made.\n\n\n\n\"In my opinion, I believe we know or we have a strong feeling who is involved in the murders,\" Long said, declining to say more or disclose the possible motive.\n\n\n\nA tragic anniversary\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Russell has been doing her part to help solve the tragic mystery.\n\n\n\n\"I've done air, water and land searches, door-to-door searches, you name it,\" she said.\n\n\n\nShe has also raised $50,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Sarah's disappearance and apparent murder.\n\n\n\n\"This being the 10-year anniversary, we just really wanted to get a lot of focus on this case again and find my daughter and what has happened to her,\" Russell said.\n\n\n\nOn the beach, Russell did things she knew her daughter would enjoy. She even brought cupcakes.\n\n\n\n\"We went for a walk, drove around. ... I was on my own, but I was with her,\" Russell said.\n\n\n\n\"It's pretty sad when the guest of honor is nowhere to be found.\"\n\n\n\nIn her short time, Sarah celebrated life with sports, learning and music.\n\n\n\n\"Sarah sang as soon as she got up each morning, as well as at the dinner table, in the bathroom and to pet her dogs,'' Russell said. '\n\n\n\n'They were like her siblings,'' she added, explaining that Sarah was an only child.\n\n\n\n\"Someone took her away from me unjustly. I'm not going to sleep until I know why.\"\n\n\n\nAnyone with more information is asked to call the Westminster Police Department at (303) 658-2400.",

  "context": "Paris, France (CNN) -- French investigators said they are looking into problems encountered by an Air France jet last month in nearly the same spot over the Atlantic where another Air France jet mysteriously crashed in June.\n\n\n\nAir France flight 445 was flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, the night of Nov. 29 when it encountered the problems, the French accident investigation agency, BEA, said in a news release this week.\n\n\n\nIt is the same route taken by Air France flight 447 when it went down in the Atlantic Ocean in stormy weather June 1, killing all 228 people aboard. The investigation agency has not established the cause of the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found.\n\n\n\n\"The analysis of what happened could lead to complementary explanations about the accident of flight AF 447,\" the investigation agency said.\n\n\n\nFlight 445 encountered \"severe turbulence\" about four hours after takeoff on Nov. 29, forcing the pilots to descend, Air France said in a statement after the flight.\n\n\n\nThe crew sent out an emergency radio message to indicate it had left its flight level, Air France said.\n\n\n\nThe flight, with 215 people aboard, \"continued normally\" after half an hour of moderate to severe turbulence, the airline said.\n\n\n\nAir France declined to comment on the investigation agency's statement this week.\n\n\n\nThe BEA said the November flight was an Airbus A330-203, the same model involved in the June crash, but Air France said the November incident involved an Airbus A330-200.\n\n\n\nWhile French authorities have not yet determined what caused the June crash, tests have brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which are used to measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed.\n\n\n\nFlight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages before it crashed that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said.\n\n\n\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich.\n\n\n\n-- CNN's Luc Lacroix contributed to this report",

  "context": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a commanding lead in national elections Wednesday, according to the latest exit polls.\n\n\n\nA woman votes at a polling station in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nAn average of six exit polls showed the incumbent holding about 60 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for former President Megawati Sukarnoputri and 12 percent for Yudhoyono's vice president, Yusuf Kalla.\n\n\n\nOfficial results are expected no sooner than next week. Indonesia has 175 million registered voters spread over 17,000 islands.\n\n\n\nIt was the country's second direct election since the authoritarian regime of dictator Suharto fell in 1998, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.\n\n\n\nAnalysts and polls, ahead of the vote, predicted Yudhoyono -- riding high on the country's economic strength -- would win a second term.  Watch as incumbent expected to win election \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn 2004, Yudhoyono defeated then-incumbent Megawati in a runoff election.  Watch more on the election \u00bb\n\n\n\nYudhoyono \"has positive global image; relations with the American government have been the best in all the time that I have been here, the last 30 years,\" said James Castle, who analyzes Indonesia's politics and economy. \"He's very popular in the foreign community and, to be honest, if he's not re-elected, the markets will react negatively for a month or so.\"\n\n\n\nYudhoyono's Democratic Party was the only single party to get enough votes in April's legislative elections to nominate a candidate on its own. Kalla's Golkar Party came in second and Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or PDI-P, placed third.\n\n\n\nKalla and Megawati had to form coalitions with other parties to run for president. Kalla had hoped voters would give him some of the credit for Indonesia's economic successes which occurred under his term as vice president.\n\n\n\nKalla and Megawati had to form coalitions with other parties to run for president.  See a photo slideshow of Indonesians talking about who they will vote for \u00bb\n\n\n\nYudhoyono is known as \"Mr. Clean\" because of his anti-corruption efforts. He has gained popularity for his handling of the 2004 tsunami recovery and the country's battle against terrorism.\n\n\n\nIndonesia has had impressive economic growth over the past five years, though how much direct credit Yudhoyono can take for that is questionable. And despite Indonesia posting an average of 5.9 percent annual growth during his presidency, little of that has trickled down to the country's poor.\n\n\n\nYudhoyono's opponents say he is too liberal, is too skewed toward the west, and doesn't pay enough attention to the 40 million Indonesians living below the poverty line.\n\n\n\nStill, the country is exhibiting surprising resilience in the face of the global economic downturn. Growth topped 6 percent last year, and Indonesia was the fastest-growing economy in southeast Asia in the first quarter of this year.\n\n\n\n\"All off a sudden, everybody is contracting except for Indonesia,\" Castle said. \"We've had more visiting regional heads and so on in the last six months than we had in the last six years.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- If you've been to the movies recently, you've probably been pummeled with trailers for interchangeable all-star action movies: \"The Expendables,\" \"The A-Team\" and \"The Losers.\" Mercenaries are in this year, and khaki is the new black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Losers\" is first out of the blocks, and it's a cheerfully vulgar shoot-'em-up that doesn't have a serious bone in its pumped-up body.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Andy Diggle's Vertigo comic book (itself loosely inspired by the old DC comic), the movie doesn't really flow; it just spurts out in quick, oily jets. It's actually less like a comic book and more like a 90-minute trailer: all the best bits stuck end to end and the filler condensed into a pithy line or (better yet) a clubby music cue. (The Kills' \"U R A Fever\" comes up twice -- once for a fight scene and then again for a sex scene -- but there's no doubt the fight is the turn-on, and it lasts much longer, too.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've seen the trailer, you'll feel you're halfway there, and if you caught co-writer Peter Berg in \"Smokin' Aces\" a couple of years back, you'll know what else is in store.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Losers are some kind of CIA black ops squad, but only for a nanosecond. There are five of them, each with his own wardrobe fetish and each with a prescribed skill set: Clay is the leader (Jeffrey Dean Morgan from \"Watchmen\"), and he looks good with one shirt-tail hanging out. Jensen (Chris Evans) is tech support and comic relief in a series of nasty T-shirts. Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) is a sniper and never separated from his cowboy hat. Pooch (Columbus Short) is the driver and family man. Roque (Idris Elba, aka Stringer Bell from \"The Wire\") is second-in-command, a knife expert with a scar down his cheek.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're a bit lightweight in star power -- Evans is the biggest draw and the most fun -- and they're not so badass that they're willing to take out a Bolivian crime boss when they realize he's surrounded himself with children.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn rescuing the kids, the Losers seal their own death warrant with their controller, Max, a super-patriot whose precise role in U.S. intelligence is shrouded in secrecy but who has been written as a cross between Dick Cheney and Dr. No (though Jason Patric, who plays him, resembles a psychotically soft-spoken Warren Beatty).\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft for dead in the jungle, the team is rescued, sort of, by a high-kicking beanpole with an open credit line. This is Aisha (Zoe Saldana), and she hires the Losers to bring down Max.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How do I know I can trust you?\" Clay wants to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because if I was lying, I wouldn't have used the words 'suicide mission,' \" she very reasonably points out.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocked into the faddish slam-cut video game look and filtered (perhaps in deference to a string of Central American locations) in malarial shades of green and yellow, \"The Losers\" wants to seem cutting edge, though it clings to a quaint Saturday morning serial black-and-white morality. Max isn't just down on kids, he plans to get his paws on \"next-generation\" weapons, kick-start a war or two, destabilize the developing world and put the U.S. back on top. Laughable!\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by Sylvain White (\"Stomp the Yard\"), the movie musters a modicum of snap, crackle and pop, but the whole shooting match is delivered in such an assiduously shorthand style that when the smoke clears, it's hard not to feel a teensy bit short-changed.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Mammoth cruise ships can be difficult to get around, even in the best of circumstances. In the worst -- which is how one might describe the situation aboard the listing Costa Concordia -- they are near impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet even before the sun rose Monday, about 120 rescue personnel were out in or around the liner that hit rocks near Tuscany and rolled spectacularly on its side.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were in a race against time, and in a battle with numerous challenges, to try to save survivors or at least recover the bodies of the passengers and crew members who are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search was temporarily suspended by noon Monday, after authorities said the vessel had begun to sway, making it dangerous for the crews. But it resumed a short time later, despite a forecast calling for increasingly strong winds that Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marino said had rescuers worried.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are \"working in very, very bad conditions,\" said Luciano Roncalli of Italy's national fire service. \"It's cold, of course. It's dark during the day and the night. ... It's really, really dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have said that at least six people died after the Costa Concordia hit rocks Friday night off the tiny island of Giglio, where nighttime temperatures have recently dipped below freezing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 29 people -- four crew members and 25 passengers -- are still unaccounted for from the listing cruise ship, Italian coast guard chief Marco Brusco said Monday, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. That figure includes two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship, the U.S. Embassy in Italy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow turned on its side, the ship is roughly half-submerged. Rescuers hope is that any survivor has found refuge above water, or perhaps in an air pocket, and can be brought out alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There could still be people locked into compartments ... where they can't physically move because of the twisting of the metal,\" said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its current state, the Costa Concordia resembles a dark, convoluted cave -- with its countless nooks and crannies and few ways to easily escape. Six underwater cave rescue divers are working among the rescue personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe divers are likely equipped with twice as much oxygen as regular scuba divers, have a guideline nearby in case they need help finding a way back to safety, and have knives and whatever lights they can carry or wear, said Robert Laird, a co-founder of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, whatever equipment and precautions they take, \"what they are doing is extremely difficult,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you do not have the right frame of mind to deal with being in the dark and in tight closed spaces, then you're (in trouble),\" said Laird, who has dived in many caves and ships, though neither he nor his group are involved in the Italian operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike open water divers, these divers don't have the luxury of coming up for air anytime they want, and they can't count on the help of sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaird said he expects that, besides being pitch-black, the water in the ship teems with debris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could swim right by a dead body and not even see it,\" Laird said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescuers are navigating a seeming labyrinth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Concordia is practically a skyscraper in two directions: 17 decks high and 951 feet long.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency personnel are aiming to look into 1,500 cabins and all around the ship's many other public spaces, including eight bars, five restaurants, four swimming pools, a casino and more. Hendrick, a veteran of many such rescue dives, estimated it could take a couple of weeks for the whole ship to be checked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's enormous,\" said Richard Bordoni, another member of the Italian national fire corps. \"They have to stay safe, and it takes them a long time to go down a corridor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Sunday, the cruise line said the ship's captain may have made \"significant\" errors leading to the wreck and subsequent rescue effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\" Costa Cruises said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities told ANSA that the captain, Francesco Schettino, has been detained for alleged manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Italian television, Schettino insisted the rocks were not marked on his map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,\" Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from shore.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Italian coast guard insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every danger in this area is on the nautical chart,\" Coast Guard Capt. Cosimo Nicastro said. \"This is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. ... All the dangers are known.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and unable to cope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,\" said passenger Benji Smith, recounting how he made his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife. \"I felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of the boat's lifeboats was available, as the ship was listing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was so crowded, and there was no room for us,\" said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. \"It was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany questions remain: Why was the ship -- with about 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- so close in to shore in an area where the seabed is pockmarked with rocks? What happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground? Why was no \"mayday\" distress signal sent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Looking at the pictures of the damage, it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute, and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss,\" said Chris McKesson, professor of naval architecture at the University of New Orleans.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever happened to cause the crash, what's happening now to deal with its aftermath -- and, ideally, get to those still on board -- is now the focus. Those rescue crews have to deal with not just myriad logistical difficulties, but also physical and mental challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency personnel in the open-air part of the ship need ropes to get around, because the floor has become the wall in most cases. Whether they are rappelling or swimming, doors may have to be opened upward, not the standard way, given the position of the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The doors are very heavy, and the windows are very thick, so it's quite difficult to break them,\" said Roncalli of the national fire service.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking one's way around without light and where everything is turned on its side can test even the toughest person's mental makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaird, of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group, notes that many cave diver deaths \"are attributed to panic.\" Even those not underwater face situations in which even a small slip-up can be life threatening, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite such challenges, Roncalli vowed that rescue personnel were prepared and intent on continuing their mission as long as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They keep on working until we are sure that no person is missing,\" he said. \"The conditions are very tough, but we can manage it.\"",

  "context": "Editor's note: Janet Tavakoli is president of Chicago-based Tavakoli Structured Finance and the author of \"Dear Mr. Buffett: What An Investor Learns 1,269 Miles From Wall Street\" (Wiley, 2009), a book about the causes of the global financial meltdown. Her company is a consulting firm for institutions and institutional investors on derivatives, the securitization of assets, and mergers and acquisitions. Her firm has done work for investment banks but not for Goldman Sachs; she worked for the company in the 1980s.\n\n\n\nJanet Tavakoli says Goldman Sachs' record profits were enabled by the taxpayer-funded bailout.\n\n\n\nCHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. announced record earnings Tuesday of $3.44 billion for the second quarter of 2009.\n\n\n\nGoldman's stock price leapt 77 percent for the first half of 2009, and closed Tuesday at $149.66 a share.\n\n\n\nWithout an ongoing series of front- and backdoor bailouts financed by U.S. taxpayers, most of Goldman's record profits would not have been possible.\n\n\n\nIn April 2009, Goldman Sachs' CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, who received record salary and bonus compensation of $68.5 million in 2007, said that bonus decisions made before the credit crisis looked \"self-serving and greedy in hindsight.\" Now, they look self-serving and greedy with foresight.\n\n\n\nGoldman set aside $11.4 billion for employee compensation and benefits, up 33 percent from last year. That's enough to pay each employee more than $390,000, just for the first six months of this year.\n\n\n\nIn June, Goldman bought back its preferred shares, repaying $10 billion it received from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and setting it free of limits on executive compensation and dividends.\n\n\n\nBut pay is not the key issue. U.S. taxpayers deserve a large cut of the profits, not the chump change -- less than a half-billion dollars -- they got from preferred shares in the company and the relatively small amount they could get from warrants in its stock.\n\n\n\nU.S. taxpayers should insist that a large part of Goldman's revenues and profits belong to the American public. TARP money was just part of a series of bailouts and concessions that allowed Goldman to prosper at the expense of a flawed regulatory system.\n\n\n\nIn March 2008, Goldman, a primary dealer in Treasury securities, was among the beneficiaries of a massive backdoor bailout by the Federal Reserve Bank. At the time, Henry Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, was treasury secretary.\n\n\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the Fed created a Term Securities Lending Facility, or TSLF, that allowed primary dealers like Goldman to give non-government-guaranteed \"triple-A\" rated assets to the Fed in exchange for loans. The trouble was that everyone knew the triple-A assets were not the safe securities they were advertised to be. Many were backed by mortgage loans that were failing at super speed.\n\n\n\nThe bailout of American International Group, or AIG, ballooned from $85 billion in September 2008 to $182.5 billion. Of that money, $90 billion was funneled as collateral payments to banks that traded with AIG. American taxpayers may never see a dime of their bailout money again, but Goldman saw plenty.\n\n\n\nGoldman may be the largest indirect beneficiary of AIG's bailout, receiving $12.9 billion in collateral, including securities lending transactions, from AIG after the government bailed out the insurance company.\n\n\n\nThe key question is whether Goldman asked AIG to insure products that were as dodgy as the doomed deal from Goldman Sachs Alternative Mortgage Products exposed by Fortune's Allan Sloan in his October 16, 2007, Loeb Award-winning article: \"Junk Mortgages Under the Microscope.\"\n\n\n\nIf the federal government had not intervened and if AIG had gone into bankruptcy, Goldman probably would not have received its $12.9 billion from AIG. U.S. taxpayers and the American economy are owed some of the bailout money passed directly through AIG to Goldman.\n\n\n\nWall Street firms also reaped trading windfalls when AIG needed to close out its derivative transactions. This was the most lucrative windfall business in the history of the derivatives markets. When AIG left money on the table, it was U.S. taxpayer money.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs was granted bank holding company status in the fall of 2008. It already had the temporary ability to borrow from the Fed through the TSLF, which would have expired in January 2009. Now it has permanent access to lending from the Fed.\n\n\n\nGoldman can now compete with the largest U.S. banks and borrow money at interest rates pushed as close to zero as possible by the Fed. Goldman gets a further benefit: favorable accounting rule changes. In addition, Goldman issued $30 billion of debt with a valuable government guarantee that remains outstanding.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the American public faces a rising unemployment rate, falling housing prices, rising unemployment, higher local taxes and a dismal economic outlook.\n\n\n\nInterested men with reputations and fortunes at stake rode roughshod over public interest. The American public is owed part of the profits Goldman was able to make because of the largesse of our Congress.\n\n\n\nWall Street's \"financial meth labs,\" including Goldman's, massively pumped out bad bonds and credit derivatives that have melted down savings accounts, pension funds, the municipal bond market and the American economy. Risky assets, leverage and fraud led to acute distress in the global financial markets.\n\n\n\nThe biggest crime on the American economy may go unpunished with no consequences to the perpetrators. The biggest crime was not predatory lending, but predatory securitizations, packages of loans that did not deserve the ratings or prices at the time they were sold. They ballooned what should have been a relatively small problem into a global crisis.\n\n\n\nWall Street owes the American public for its key role in bringing the global economy -- and in particular, the U.S. economy -- to its knees. Goldman is not alone in owing the American public. It is not the worst of all of the Wall Street firms. But among all of Wall Street's offenders, it is the most well-connected, and Goldman was the firm that cleaned up the most as the result of government bailouts.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Janet Tavakoli.",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday approved an agreement granting Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, permanent custody of his children.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson has accused the executors of her son Michael's estate of \"keeping her in the dark.\"\n\n\n\nA hearing is scheduled for October to look at some remaining issues.\n\n\n\nAn agreement between Katherine Jackson, 79, and Debbie Rowe, mother of Jackson's two eldest children, cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing.\n\n\n\nRowe, who was briefly married to Michael Jackson, agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson was in the courtroom along with her daughters LaToya and Rebbie and a son, Randy.\n\n\n\nRowe did not attend Monday's hearing, but her attorney, Eric George, spoke briefly outside the courthouse.\n\n\n\n\"She's faced difficulties and pressures none of us know, and today's agreement shows that she responded with heart, integrity and selflessness,\" George said of Rowe. He also praised Katherine Jackson's attorneys for their part in bringing about the agreement.\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson's two oldest children -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., 12, and Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, 11 -- signed consents to the agreement.\n\n\n\nHe also has a 7-year-old son, Michael Joseph Jackson II, known as Blanket, with an unidentified surrogate.\n\n\n\nThe custody agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe \"apart from the continuation of spousal support payments\" that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after the divorce, their lawyers said in a joint statement.  Watch Rowe's attorney talk about the decision \u00bb\n\n\n\nJackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death June 25.\n\n\n\nAlso at the hearing Monday, attorneys for Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, said he sought a role in the children's lives and wanted \"in some way to be involved\" in respect to their education and medical care, although he was not objecting to the custody agreement. But Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff denied Klein's request to be a party to the hearing.\n\n\n\nDetails of how the children were conceived and who was the biological father have been closely guarded amid much public speculation.\n\n\n\nIn an interview last month on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Klein did not rule out being the biological father of the children.\n\n\n\n\"Not to the best of my knowledge,\" he said when asked by Diane Sawyer whether he was the father. \"All I can tell you is, best of my knowledge, I am not the father of these children. But I am telling you, if push comes to shove, I can't say anything.\"\n\n\n\nAsked about Klein's attorneys saying he wants a role in the children's lives, George declined comment. Klein was not in the hearing Monday.\n\n\n\nRowe and Jackson divorced in 1999, with Rowe giving him full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support.\n\n\n\nRowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court ruled that her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door for a possible custody battle.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Beckloff awarded Katherine Jackson all of the family allowance funds she requested but gave only 83.5 percent of what she requested in support of the children.\n\n\n\nHe said he disallowed money for one item, which he described as \"quite a large amount\" that he was not sure was necessary. The allowance order is sealed.\n\n\n\nBeckloff set a hearing to revisit the allowance matter in January.\n\n\n\nAlso Monday, Beckloff ordered Katherine Jackson be given copies of her son's contracts in connection with a series of concerts that had been scheduled for this summer.\n\n\n\nShe sought the contracts between Michael Jackson and AEG, the company that was organizing and promoting the concerts, along with others involved in the tour. She has agreed to keep the contract provisions confidential.\n\n\n\nSharing of the contracts was a major point of contention between Katherine Jackson and the two men who control her son's estate: John Branca, Michael Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend.\n\n\n\nBranca's attorney argued in a court filing that his client had no choice but to request confidentiality from Katherine Jackson, since the contracts have a provision keeping them confidential.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson has also challenged the two men named as executors of her son's will. However, Beckloff did not rule on that matter Monday, saying he would like attorneys for the two sides to attempt to reach a resolution on their own.\n\n\n\nThe attorneys conferred on the estate dispute during a morning recess that stretched to more than 90 minutes without reaching an agreement.\n\n\n\nLawyers for Branca and McClain suggested Beckloff appoint them as executors of the will, but Beckloff instead extended their appointment as special administrators of Jackson's estate for another 60 days while he considers Katherine Jackson's objections.\n\n\n\n\"We believe the judge did the right thing,\" Branca's attorney, Howard Weitzman, told reporters after the hearing.\n\n\n\n\"We're quite pleased that the judge did what was appropriate.\" He took no questions.\n\n\n\nDuring Monday's hearing, Beckloff asked one of her attorneys, Burt Levitch, if there was any objection to admitting the will for probate -- without deciding who its executors will be. Beckloff noted that no one has come forward to object to the terms of the will itself. Levitch agreed, and Beckloff officially admitted the will for probate. The action starts a 120-day clock running for the will to be probated.\n\n\n\nThe will, written in 2002, places all of Michael Jackson's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson's attorneys filed a petition last week accusing the men who now control the estate of being \"intent on keeping her in the dark\" about deals they've made or are negotiating. Londell McMillan, Jackson's lead attorney, raised questions about \"a suspicious circle of relationships\" involving Branca and McClain.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson is asking the judge to order Branca, McClain and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are \"fit and able\" to administer the estate. The men also were served with a 19-page demand for documents, including the AEG contracts.\n\n\n\nBranca's lawyers argued that Katherine Jackson's demand for documents is too broad and burdensome. But, McMillan said, \"such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate.\"\n\n\n\nBeckloff expressed concern, however, about delaying the appointment of executors for too long, since they must deal with any creditors to the estate that come forward.\n\n\n\nMcMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million.\n\n\n\nThe next hearings in the matter are scheduled for August 10 and August 28 to deal with safe harbor motions. Katherine Jackson wants Beckloff to set aside a provision in her son's will that anyone who challenges its terms can be dropped from the will.",

She was seated or standing in the front of the vessel as it was traveling about 25 mph out of a channel, Pino said.\n\n\n\n\"The ray just actually popped up in front of the vessel,\" he said. \"The father had not even a second to react. It was too late. It happened instantly and the woman fell backwards and, unfortunately, died as a result of the collision.\"\n\n\n\nThe accident happened off the coast of Marathon Key, about 2\u00bd hours' drive south of Miami. Zagorski was taken to the Fishermen's Hospital in Marathon, where she was pronounced dead.  Watch marine officers work around dead ray on boat \u00bb\n\n\n\nPino said he had seen rays leap into the air, but added, \"it's very rare for them to collide with objects.\"  Watch experts explain why eagle rays leap \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe spotted-eagle ray weighed about 75 to 80 pounds and had a 6-foot wingspan, Pino said.  Watch officials investigate eagle ray collision \u00bb\n\n\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife said eagle rays \"are not an aggressive species, but they do tend to leap from the water.\" Spotted eagle rays can have a wingspan of up to 10 feet and can weigh 500 pounds, it said.

I pledge that the department has fixed the internal process that allowed this document to be released before it was ready.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report was an unclassified assessment sent to law enforcement agencies. It was titled \"Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mention of combat veterans surfaced on a conservative radio program earlier this month, and it drew the scorn of commentators and conservative members of Congress. Rep.

  "context": "(CNN) -- The man closest to Tiger Woods when he plays golf says he had no idea about the extramarital affairs that have sidelined Woods from the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Williams, Woods' caddy and confidant for nearly a decade, talked to New Zealand's TV3 about the scandal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I knew nothing,\" Williams said in an interview posted on the station's Web site Thursday. \"I don't need to clarify it, extend that answer. I knew nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams said he's heard the calls from some that he should be fired for not preventing Woods' downfall. \"In some people's perception, I'm involved with it, and I've committed a crime or done wrong,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the shoe was on somebody else, I would say the same thing, it would be very difficult for the caddy not to know,\" he said. \"But I'm 100 percent telling you, I knew nothing, and that's that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams' wife, Kirsty, defended her husband, insisting he would not have been able to keep the secret from her or Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The four of us are so close,\" she told TV3. \"Being so close, he couldn't know and not say something to Elin or myself. You know, it's just, that's the way it is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWoods, 34, apologized last month in a tightly controlled televised statement for his \"irresponsible and selfish\" behavior, which he said included infidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe February 19 statement was his first public appearance since he crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and a tree near his home in November. The crash and reports about why it happened sparked a barrage of infidelity allegations against the golfer, who has two children with his wife.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams, who gets 10 percent of the millions Woods wins on the golf tour every year, said he would not have kept it secret just to protect his job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm a straight up sort of person, if I had known something was going on, the whistle would have been blown,\" Williams said. \"He knows that I'm straight up, that's the way I operate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he is disappointed with Woods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of course, I'm mad at him,\" he said. \"Why would you not be? He's obviously let his family down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams said he and Woods will talk about the scandal eventually, but not now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When a guy's having a tough time, that's not the time,\" he said. \"It's not up to me to beat him with a stick right now. I mean, he's getting enough grilling from everybody else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams said his role now is to talk to Woods -- who he described as \"one of my closest friends\" -- about the future and help him get back on the golf tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you are friends with somebody, and you're a true friend to somebody, that's when somebody needs your support, and that's when they need you the most, that's when you don't walk away,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his February 19 statement, Woods left open the possibility of returning to professional golf this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams predicted that Woods would bounce back from his troubles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tiger's biggest asset is his mental strength,\" he said. \"So, he's going to need all his mental strength to get out of this, no question about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Woods not playing, Williams is spending more time with his personal passion: speedway racing in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I'm not working on the tour, I don't miss it one bit,\" he said.",

But faced with mounting chaos in a country already in economic free fall, the bank decided last week to raise that limit to 100 million dollars ($50 U.S.) per week.\n\n\n\nSoldiers were deployed to all banks in anticipation of throngs of people lining up to withdraw money Thursday, when the increase took effect. Wednesday, police chased depositors away and arrested union leaders who planned to protest the limits.\n\n\n\nZimbabwe's inflation rate of 231 million percent is the world's highest. In addition, the country is faced with a growing outbreak of cholera that its government declared a national emergency Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe outbreak has killed at least 565 people and sickened more than 11,000, the U.N. Humanitarian Affairs Office said. Medical professionals blame the resurgence of the water-borne disease on the lack of safe water in many parts of the country.\n\n\n\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said 69 people were arrested across the country during Wednesday's demonstrations. Amnesty International has demanded to know the whereabouts of human rights activist Jestina Mukoko, whom it said was abducted at dawn Wednesday by armed men in plainclothes posing as police.\n\n\n\nAnd angry, unpaid soldiers clashed with foreign currency exchangers and some civilians Monday, three days after troops who had failed to get cash from their banks looted shops they suspected to be illegally dealing in foreign currency.",

Last year, he edged out Chestnut by nearly two dogs, eating a then-record 53 and three-quarters to Chestnut's 52.\n\n\n\nChestnut, who hails from San Jose, California, set a record with Wednesday's feat of eating 66 hot dogs, the event's organizers said.\n\n\n\nNot since Joe Frazier defeated Muhammad Ali in the 1971 bout coined the \"Fight of the Century\" have two contestants battled so hard. Perhaps.\n\n\n\nAt one point, Kobayashi expelled some of his half-mashed hot dogs from his mouth; those did not count in his total.\n\n\n\nChestnut toiled beside him, a vein throbbing in his forehead and his face bright red.  Watch how the wiener-off went down \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"My body worked for me,\" Chestnut said in an interview after the contest.\n\n\n\nKobayashi, 29 years old and weighing in at 154 pounds, was listed as questionable prior to the event. He was receiving acupuncture treatment Wednesday morning to relieve pain in his jaw after wisdom tooth surgery.\n\n\n\nVideo from Tuesday's weigh-in showed that he could open his mouth only half way.\n\n\n\nChestnut, 23, weighing 215 pounds, had broken Kobayashi's 2006 record by downing 59\u00bd hot dogs at a qualifying contest in Phoenix last month.\n\n\n\nChestnut claims the \"Coveted Mustard Yellow International Belt\" and wins a one-year supply of hot dogs from Nathan's, the sponsor of the annual event, which has been held on the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn since 1916.\n\n\n\nOrganizers said 50,000 people attended Wednesday's contest.\n\n\n\nChestnut is a civil engineering student at San Jose University.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez revealed a deeply personal side in an interview Thursday night, saying he loves Jesus Christ and would have liked to play Major League baseball in Yankee Stadium.\n\n\n\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez spoke highly of President Obama at the United Nations on Thursday.\n\n\n\nHe also expressed a fondness for American people and culture, saying he likes the movie actor Charles Bronson and the poet Walt Whitman. He loves to sing, he said, though he does not do it well.\n\n\n\nAnd Chavez had kind words for the U.S. security detail protecting him during his visit to New York, saying he chatted with them while out walking and that they \"have been very gracious, very efficient and very attentive, very kind.\"\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN's Larry King, Chavez spoke at length about a host of issues: relations between Venezuela and the United States and his hopes for improved ties with President Barack Obama; Iran, Israel and those who deny that the Holocaust existed; efforts to overthrow him and have him assassinated; criticism that he is power hungry and trying to silence critics.\n\n\n\nChavez, a self-proclaimed socialist, spoke with King a few hours after giving a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, in which he praised Obama but criticized some U.S. policies.   Watch Chavez speak at the U.N. General Assembly \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen asked whether he is misunderstood in the United States, Chavez seemed to turn reflective.\n\n\n\n\"I'm a man with many defects,\" he said. \"I love. I sing. I dream. I was born in the poor countryside. I was raised in the countryside, planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother. My children, my two daughters are with me and I want a better world for my grandchildren, for your grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\"Now, they demonize me. But that's the start of these world campaigns to try to defend what you cannot defend -- a system that is destroying the world. ... I'm a Christian. I want the world of justice and equality. This is the only way to achieve peace.\"\n\n\n\nChavez then talked about his religious upbringing and current faith.\n\n\n\n\"I was an altar boy,\" he said. \"My mother wanted me to be a priest. I am very Christian and Catholic. ... I'm very faithful. I believe in God, in Jesus Christ. I love Jesus Christ. I am a Christian. ... I cry when I see injustice, children dying of hunger.\"\n\n\n\nHis comments were all the more remarkable because Chavez and the Catholic Church have been at odds since he came to power in 1999. The church has been one of his major critics, with Pope Benedict XVI and other church leaders expressing concern over what they see as attempts by Chavez to limit the church's influence. Chavez's efforts to change anti-abortion laws have been at the top of those concerns.\n\n\n\nChavez, in turn, has referred to church leadership as a \"tumor.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking of other matters, Chavez said he hopes for improved relations with Obama, but \"we want relations based on respect, relations of peoples where we are respected.\"\n\n\n\nThat has not been the case so far, he said.\n\n\n\n\"Most governments in the United States in a hundred years have not respected the peoples of Latin America,\" Chavez told King. \"They have sponsored coup d'etats, assassinations. It's enough. We want to be brothers and sisters. We want respect and equality.\"\n\n\n\nChavez particularly criticized former President George W. Bush, whom he accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt on the Venezuelan leader during a short-lived coup in 2002. Chavez regained power within days.  Watch Chavez discuss the alleged assassination attempt \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"The Bush government toppled me,\" he said. \"They asked for my assassination. They disrespected us. ... I saw my assassins. ... I was a prisoner in Venezuela, being a president. They took me to the seaside. I was debating with those who wanted murder me. They received the order to kill me. However, at this very moment, a group of soldiers refused. They did not kill me, but I saw those who wanted to kill me, and the order came from the White House.\"\n\n\n\nChavez also expressed concern that the United States, which he calls \"the empire,\" still would like to topple him. As he has numerous times in recent weeks, Chavez criticized U.S. plans to begin operating out of military bases in neighboring Colombia. The United States says it needs a presence in Colombia to fight drug traffickers. Chavez sees a sinister intent.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what country he fears would harm him, Chavez replied, \"The empire. The empire. Seven military bases ... in Colombia, that's a serious threat against Venezuela.\"\n\n\n\nChavez also defended his relationship with Iran but denied having said that Iran would help Venezuela obtain nuclear technology. Iran has embarked on a nuclear program that the United States and other nations think will lead it to develop nuclear weapons before long.\n\n\n\n\"They have fooled you,\" Chavez said. \"I've never said that Iran is going to help us to have nuclear technology. ... That's a strategy to attack Venezuela and say that we are building an atomic bomb. That's the next accusation. And I'm going to say this now: Please, come on. That's crazy. That's crazy.\"\n\n\n\nChavez said he does not agree with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contention that the Holocaust, in which 6 million European Jews were killed during World War II, never existed.\n\n\n\n\"But there also was another holocaust in South America,\" Chavez said. \"I do not deny the Jewish Holocaust. And I condemn it. But in South America, when the Europeans arrived, there were close to 90 million Indians; 200 years later, we only had four million remaining. That was a holocaust. And the Europeans denied this holocaust.\"\n\n\n\nIsrael came under criticism from Chavez, who called it a \"small country with atomic bombs, and very aggressive country. ... They have massacred entire families. It is a war-mongering country.\"\n\n\n\nTurning to the situation in his own country, Chavez denied that he is trying to shut down critical media, such as the independent Globovision TV station. Government officials have levied several charges against the station, saying that it is disseminating false information and trying to foment dissatisfaction against Chavez.\n\n\n\nThe Chavez government has repealed licenses for other independent TV and radio stations, and has threatened to do so against Globovision.\n\n\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter this week joined human rights groups and others who have expressed concern over what they see as Chavez becoming too authoritarian. Chavez dismissed the criticism.\n\n\n\n\"Never in Venezuela have we had so much freedom of speech as now,\" he said.\n\n\n\nPressed by King about whether he is going to shut down Globovision, Chavez answered, \"I do not know. It depends on them. If they keep on sponsoring coup d'etats, if they keep on calling for my assassination, if they keep on breaching the law even as well, it is not Chavez that's going to close them. I want to apply the law. We need to respect the law. It is the law. It's out of logic, and it's pure logic.\"\n\n\n\nAs to Carter, Chavez said, \"Yes, I read that and I regret for him, because I think he's totally confounded and lost. It's a long time since he visited us. I respect him enormously, but I think he is wrong. He's a victim of so much falsehood in the world.\"",

He also met with President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe negotiations over the natural gas supply had stalled for more than a year due to disagreements over price.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an agreement can be reached, the deal would see Russia supply China with up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The trade volume will increase significantly, and this will change the fact that the economic cooperation between the two countries lags behind the political cooperation,\" said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Together with cooperation in other economic fields, China and Russia will become real strategic partners in economic terms,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent years have seen a steady increase in trade between the two countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, bilateral trade volume in the year to July increased by 37.4% to a record $42.2 billion. The ministry forecasts that this will reach a new record in 2011-- possibly in excess of $70 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has reached to an unprecedented level,\" Putin said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut energy cooperation stands out as the main focus between Russia, a major energy exporter, and China, the world's biggest energy consumer, according to a 2010 report from the International Energy Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nPutin has also brought along a group of 160 Russian business leaders for the visit, including the CEOs of Russian energy giants Gazprom, Rosneft and aluminum producer UC RUSAL.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Putin's visit, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan also met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to discuss energy needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're discussing opening new energy transportation routes,\" explained Putin at the joint press conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 2011, China and Russia opened an oil pipeline from Daqing, northeast China, to Skovorodino in eastern Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line is 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and aims to provide 15 million metric tons of oil annually to China.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The tabloid-friendly tale of the so-called California \"Octomom\" continues to stir debate -- this time 2,000 miles away in the Georgia state capitol, where lawmakers say they're trying to prevent a repeat.\n\n\n\nProposed legislation regulating in-vitro practices came after Nadya Suleman gave birth to octuplets.\n\n\n\nA Georgia state senator introduced legislation to limit the number of embryos that can be implanted in a woman's uterus during in-vitro fertilization procedures.\n\n\n\nSen. Ralph Hudgens, a Republican from near Athens, Georgia, said his legislation was inspired by Nadya Suleman, the woman who said she gave birth to octuplets after being fertilized with six embryos -- an unusually high number.\n\n\n\n\"She is not married,\" said Hudgens. \"She is unemployed, she is on government assistance and now she is going to put those 14 children on the back of the taxpayers in the state of California.\"\n\n\n\nSuleman, 33, had six children before the procedure.\n\n\n\nHudgens' plan, which was co-sponsored by several other senators, would limit the number of embryos a doctor could implant to two for women under 40 years old and three for women 40 or older.\n\n\n\nThose numbers are slightly less than what's considered the norm in medical circles.\n\n\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40. The reason for allowing more embryos in women over 40 is that it is more difficult for them to get pregnant.\n\n\n\nState lawmakers in Missouri are considering a similar bill. And England and Italy have had similar limits on the books for years.\n\n\n\nAt least some fertility doctors say the limits in Hudgens' bill would hurt chances for women to get pregnant. They say that while three embryos are usually enough, there are special cases when they need more.\n\n\n\n\"What this bill will effectively do is shut us down,\" said Dr. Daniel Shapiro, a fertility doctor in Atlanta. \"Patients seeking reproductive care in Georgia will go to Tennessee or South Carolina or Alabama. They will just leave.\"\n\n\n\nBreaking the law would carry a fine of up to $1,000 under the legislation.\n\n\n\nSome critics of the plan also see another problem, calling it a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions in the state.\n\n\n\nThe bill, which Hudgens titled the \"Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act,\" contains language that says \"a living in vitro human embryo is a biological human being who is not the property of any person or entity.\"\n\n\n\nThe anti-abortion group Georgia Right to Life issued a news release in support of the bill on the day it was introduced.\n\n\n\n\"Georgia Right to Life supports Sen. Hudgens in this legislation and wants to see strong protections in place to stop the dangerous practice of implanting more embryos than is medically recommended,\" the group said, saying the plan would help avoid premature births and low birth weight in in-vitro fertilization cases.\n\n\n\nRealistically, the bill faces long odds of passing -- at least in the near future. Tuesday was Day 25 of the Georgia legislature's 40-day session. Legislators will meet 10 more days, then take a break until June, when lawmakers will consider how money flowing to the state from the federal economic-stimulus plan may help their ongoing budget woes.\n\n\n\nAccording the the Georgia legislature's Web site on Tuesday, Hudgens' bill had been read and assigned to a committee, but no other action had taken place.\n\n\n\nSome Georgians from the lawmaker's part of the state say they hope he has to keep waiting for a long time.\n\n\n\n\"Unless the senator is a physician, ethicist or other informed professional, he should step aside and let the medical professionals determine what is best in individual cases,\" Dorothy West wrote in a letter to the editor of the Athens Banner-Herald, Hudgens' hometown paper. \"There are other issues more important to the citizens of Georgia that should be addressed.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Doug Gross contributed to this report.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 16 year-old Australian schoolgirl is hoping to achieve a sailing feat that is so tough it has brought many experienced men and women to the brink of death.\n\n\n\nSixteen-year-old Jessica Watson of Australia plans to sail solo around the world\n\n\n\nJessica Watson, of Mooloolaba, Queensland, plans to set out on a solo round-the-world sailing mission in November -- and hopes to become the youngest person to ever sail non-stop around the world alone.\n\n\n\nBut with the impending weeks of solitary confinement, freeze-dried foods, changing conditions and threat of injury, illness or death -- why would she want to do it?\n\n\n\nWatson told CNN her inspiration had come from fellow Australian Kay Cottee, who became the first woman to sail the globe alone, without stopping; and German-born Australian Jesse Martin, who still holds the record as the youngest person to do it.\n\n\n\nMartin achieved his feat in 1999 aged 18 (at the finish), and subsequently wrote a book titled \"Lionheart: A Journey of the Human Spirit.\"\n\n\n\n\"I read Jesse's book and that was inspiring. If you had to put it down to one thing that encouraged me to do this that would be a good one,\" Watson said.\n\n\n\nSince deciding she wanted to take on what she describes as the \"Everest of the ocean\" about four years ago, Watson has been doing all she can to gain the best preparation for the adventure.\n\n\n\nShe has already sailed \"mock solo\" across the Tasman Sea, which flows between Australia and New Zealand, at 15 and has been sailing since she was 8 years-old.\n\n\n\n\"I've been talking to people [who have done it] about it all, and I'll get in some good solo miles before I go,\" she said.\n\n\n\nDespite the experience she has gained, Watson admits there are some aspects of the journey that remain unknown.\n\n\n\n\"There are definitely things I'm nervous about -- like the big waves and gear failure. But, it's amazing the detail of preparation we can get and what you can do with technology.\n\n\n\n\"Though, there's no telling how you'll handle yourself when you're out there for eight months until you're actually out there.\"\n\n\n\nWatson's journey around the globe is part of what seems to be an increasingly popular trend among young sailors.\n\n\n\nSeventeen year-old Briton, Mike Perham is currently part-way through his attempt to sail the world solo for charity.\n\n\n\nPerham is at present stuck in Tasmania, Australia, with gear problems and faces the daunting task of sailing around Cape Horn during the winter season.\n\n\n\nStill, he has come a long way when many people had raised concerns about the voyage before he departed.\n\n\n\nOn his daily blog, Perham writes about the challenges of being at sea alone, \"The first few days at sea are always the worst -- the lack of sleep leaves me feeling drained all the time but I know I just need to keep pushing on, knowing that I'll soon acclimatize and that things are going to get better and better.\"\n\n\n\nAnother teenager -- 16 year-old Zac Sunderland, who is from California -- is also on a mission to become the youngest sailor to achieve the feat. Sunderland has also progressed from his departure point in California, through the Panama Canal, and into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\nFor Perham, Sunderland and Watson it was the high level of communications technology at the teenagers disposal as they sail that has convinced their parents to allow them to attempt their journeys. Would you allow your teenage daughter or son to sail solo around the world? Tell us below in the SoundOff box\n\n\n\nOn Sunderland's Web site his father, Laurence, said, \"Although Zac is alone as he sails, he really has so much help.\n\n\n\nThere will always be people who will disagree with our decision to let Zac go on this trip. It was his idea and it is his desire to continue.\"\n\n\n\nWatson said her parents had also been supportive from the outset.\n\n\n\nFor the young sailor, the next big challenge is preparing the boat for departure and securing a final sponsor to help fund the journey.\n\n\n\nShe said her life is primarily geared towards the challenge this year.\n\n\n\n\"It might take a little bit longer to finish school ... this puts everything else on hold.\"",

  "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday discussed a \"general time horizon\" for any American troop withdrawals from Iraq, al-Maliki's office said.\n\n\n\nSen. Barack Obama rides in a helicopter Monday with Gen. David Petraeus in Baghdad, Iraq.\n\n\n\nObama -- who has made ending the Iraq war a cornerstone of his run for office -- engaged in what were described as productive talks with al-Maliki during a trip to Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe Iraqi government has been pushing for the United States to set a general timetable to spell out troop withdrawals.\n\n\n\nIraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi also met with Obama Monday and told reporters afterward they discussed the security agreement.\n\n\n\n\"I told Sen. Obama (that) Iraqi and American negotiations regarding this are ongoing, and today new Iraqi-American negotiations on this agreement have started with Iraqi written proposals and have a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration has opposed timetables for troop withdrawals. But al-Maliki and President Bush last week agreed to a \"general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals\" on troop cuts.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister reiterated that principle with Obama, according to a statement from al-Maliki's office.\n\n\n\n\"Developments of the situation and the circumstances is what will decide the presence of foreign troops in Iraq, but without keeping open-ended dates,\" al-Maliki said, according to a statement from his office.\n\n\n\n\"With the developments on the ground, we can set a vision and clear horizons regarding this issue, and this is a view both sides agree on in the ongoing negotiations.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Maliki's office quoted Obama as saying he is \"supportive and committed to preserving the gains achieved by the Iraqi government\" under al-Maliki's leadership and that he admires the prime minister's courage.\n\n\n\nObama has proposed withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office. Spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government's \"vision\" is that most U.S. combat troops would be out of Iraq by 2010. Asked if that stance is part of the current negotiations, al-Dabbagh said, \"No. This is the Iraqi vision.\" iReport.com: Tell us the most important thing the next president needs to know about Iraq\n\n\n\nA German magazine on Saturday quoted al-Maliki as saying he backed Obama's proposal, but al-Dabbagh has said that his remarks \"were misunderstood, mistranslated and not conveyed accurately.\"\n\n\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the magazine, Der Spiegel, said it \"stands by its version of this interview.\"\n\n\n\nIn the magazine interview, al-Maliki did not indicate that he was endorsing Obama over Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\n\n\nMcCain does not think American troops should return to the United States until Iraqi forces are capable of maintaining a safe, democratic state. He has been a strong advocate of the \"surge\" -- the 2007 escalation of U.S. troops -- and has said troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed.\n\n\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -- who's been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for McCain -- on Monday criticized Obama's push to remove troops in 16 months as an \"arbitrary timetable based on politics versus a plan based on the actual results on the ground.\"\n\n\n\n\"One of the reasons I'm supporting [McCain] -- he has made it clear he would rather lose an election than lose a war. He's made it very clear -- let's listen to the commanders on the ground,\" Jindal said on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\n\n\nMcCain last week chided Obama for laying out his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan before talking to Gen. David Petraeus, the head of U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\n\n\nObama met with Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, in Baghdad on Monday.\n\n\n\nHe also met with Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni Arab who is one of Iraq's two vice presidents; Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of Multi-National Corps-Iraq; British Maj. Gen. Barney White Spunner, commander of Multi-National Division South East; and Maj. General Abdul Aziz, the Iraqi army's 14th Division commander.\n\n\n\nObama's stop in Iraq marks his second visit to the country. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's trip abroad began in Kuwait and Afghanistan and will go on to Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, Germany, France and Britain. The senator from Illinois first visited Iraq in 2006.  See the stops on Obama's trip \u00bb\n\n\n\nObama arrived Monday afternoon in the southern city of Basra, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Armand Cucciniello.\n\n\n\nObama is traveling with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and is an outspoken critic of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nObama has said that if he's elected, he would commit more troops to Afghanistan and would order the military to end the war in Iraq, which he has called a \"dangerous distraction\" from the Afghan battle.\n\n\n\nObama spent Saturday and Sunday in Afghanistan, where he met with U.S. troops at three bases and with Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- a leader the Democratic senator has criticized for doing too little to rebuild the war-torn nation.  Watch Obama meet Karzai, U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe fight in Afghanistan recently has become a more pressing issue on the political radar. More coalition forces have died in Afghanistan than in Iraq in May, June and so far in July.\n\n\n\nLast week, in a major address laying out his foreign policy position, Obama said, \"As should have been apparent to President Bush and Sen. McCain, the central front in the war on terror is not Iraq, and it never was.\"\n\n\n\nHe said part of his strategy would be \"taking the fight to al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Frederik Pleitgen and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Jenson Button is relishing Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix, as the McLaren driver returns to the site of his first-ever victory for the 200th race of his Formula One career.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old withdrew from last weekend's German Grand Prix, won by his teammate Lewis Hamilton, after 35 laps with hydraulics problems, but Button is hoping for better luck at the track where he tasted success as a Honda driver in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's always fun coming back to Hungary as this is the track at which I won my first grand prix,\" the 2009 drivers' champion told McLaren's web site. \"After a premature end to my race at the Nurburgring, I'll be hoping for better luck at the Hungaroring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can't believe I've already knocked up a double-ton of F1 starts because I don't feel a day older than when I made my debut back in 2000!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nResurgent Hamilton triumphs in Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nButton made his first appearance in the elite division of motorsport at the Australian Grand Prix in 2000 with Williams, and has since gone on to represent Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda, Brawn GP and now McLaren in an 11-year career.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Briton has notched up 10 grand prix triumphs and secured his only world crown to date in 2009, while racing for Brawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nButton is hopeful of a strong showing on Sunday and is taking encouragement from his third-place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix -- a circuit he feels presents a very similar challenge to the Hungaroring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The MP4-26 [McLaren's car] was very competitive in Monaco a couple of months ago and I hope it will be a similar situation this weekend because the Hungaroring has many of the same performance criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest F1 standings after the German GP\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cockpit temperatures regularly exceed 50 degrees and we're always pulling g-force in the car because there are so many corners. It's tough, but this is definitely a circuit when all the training pays dividends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton is also a previous winner in Hungary having triumphed at the venue in 2007 and the 26-year-old is eager to build on his success at the Nurburgring last time out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've always gone well in Hungary,\" said the 2008 world champion. \"I like the circuit because it's old school. It has a very historic feel to it, with hills and bumps and cambers changes, and it has massive character.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton beat off fierce competition from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber of Red Bull to earn a hard-fought win in Germany and he is anticipating another close contest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There wasn't much between McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull in Germany. It's going to be fascinating to see which team holds the advantage next weekend.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Hamilton, Alonso and Webber finishing on the podium last time out, all three drivers trail reigning world champion and current standings leader Sebastian Vettel.\n\n\n\n\n\nVettel, 24, holds a 77-point lead over his colleague Webber at the top of the championship heading into the 11th race of the season.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Do not go backstage at Cirque Du Soleil. It will only hurt your self-esteem.\n\n\n\nAnthony Gatto says he's been in training since he was 3 years old and performing since he was 8.\n\n\n\nIn the performers' tent for the touring show \"Kooza,\" there are the chiseled men catapulting their partners onto each other's shoulders from a giant see-saw and the woman doing contortions on children's-sized blocks.\n\n\n\nYou can only take so much of this before your ego needs normal.\n\n\n\nNormal might be that man in the corner, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers throwing balls in the air. How hard can that be?\n\n\n\nYour self-worth will be quickly dashed again when the man picks up a soccer ball, bounces it on his head and jumps rope at the same time. Moments later, he's juggling six or seven orange rings (they move so fast, it looks like a blur) and then does a pirouette -- while all the rings are in the air -- and then catches them on his arm.  Watch the juggler in action \u00bb\n\n\n\nYou could say Anthony Gatto went into the family business. But his stepfather wasn't a farmer or a doctor. He was a juggler.\n\n\n\n\"By the time I was 8, I was entered into a juggling competition, and incidentally, that was the same competition that Patrick Dempsey, the actor, was in,\" Gatto said. \"He used to be a juggler. We competed against each other. I took first, he took second. Now he's a big actor and here I am, juggling.\"\n\n\n\nGatto is being modest. In fact, he didn't audition for \"Kooza.\" The show went looking for him.\n\n\n\n\"I have right now 11 juggling world records,\" he said. \"Some of them I've held since I was 16 years old and they have yet to be beaten.\"\n\n\n\nImagine a wearable disco ball. That's not too different from the form-fitting outfit Gatto wears onstage. Backstage, it's a long-sleeve T-shirt, gym shorts and sneakers.\n\n\n\nBut there's nothing casual about his daily routine. He typically works out and practices six to seven hours a day to prepare for his 10 minutes in the spotlight. In fact, he is practicing until moments before he runs on stage.\n\n\n\n\"Juggling is something that is so delicate, you have to have a really good feel, you can lose that in minutes,\" he said. \"There are so many variables that can affect you. If it's a humid day, it's a very difficult task to get through the number that I do. The wind, if there's any air current in there and you're expecting to catch a ring and it blows an inch, you miss it.\"\n\n\n\nBut he rarely misses -- at least not in his act. This performer, who relies on coordination and concentration 350 shows a year, admits his most embarrassing moment has nothing to do with balls, clubs or rings. It's acting that trips him up.\n\n\n\n\"I have fallen as the delivery-man character in the show. In fact, I have done this a few times,\" he said. \"I like to think it's because I put my heart and soul into the characters I'm portraying.\"\n\n\n\nSurrounded by all this talent and precision, there is some comfort in knowing one of the best -- maybe the best juggler in the world -- is also a klutz.",

  "context": "RICHMOND, Virginia (CNN) -- Lawyers for convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui urged an appeals court panel Monday to throw out his guilty plea and grant their client a new trial. They argued Moussaoui did not have an adequate defense and lacked key information to defend himself.\n\nZacarias Moussaoui is serving a life sentence at the federal prison in Colorado known as Supermax.\n\nLegal analysts believe the appeal has only a slim chance of success.\n\nIn arguments before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for Moussaoui said he was confused about the charges he was pleading guilty to, and he did not have access to information that would have shown he was not supposed to be part of the 9/11 plot.\n\nOne defense lawyer characterized Moussaoui as \"unknowing.\" Defense lawyers point to statements, later made public, from the man who plotted the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who said Moussaoui was not intended to be a participant. Moussaoui did not know what Mohammed had said because it had been classified.\n\n\"A guilty plea that is invalid is invalid,\" defense attorney Justin Antonipillai told the three-judge panel.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer strongly countered, telling the court Moussaoui's plea was voluntary and unconditional. Referring to a letter Moussaoui sent the district court at the time of the plea, Justice Department attorney Kevin Gingras said, \"He understands what he is pleading guilty to.\"\n\nGingras told the court Moussaoui knew in general that there was information that could help his defense but chose to plead guilty anyway, thereby waiving any right to now challenge that decision.\n\n\"He understood there was stuff out there,\" Gingras said. \"He knew the gist,\" referring to redacted copies of appeal court rulings about what detainees might testify to and the 9/11 commission report.\n\nIn April of 2005, Moussaoui pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges, and in May of 2006 he was sentenced to life in prison after a jury decided not to impose a death sentence.\n\nMoussaoui, who is being held at the maximum security federal prison in Colorado known as Supermax, was not in the courtroom for the hearing. It's expected to be several months before a ruling is issued.\n\nHis attorney was met with mostly skeptical questioning by the judges.\n\n\"He insisted on pleading guilty and was allowed to do so only after extensive efforts to assure that it was knowing and voluntary,\" said former U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey, adding the district judge presiding over the case tried to make sure Moussaoui's rights were protected.\n\nMoussaoui's attorneys argued his original defense team, which vehemently tried to dissuade him from pleading guilty, should have been able in an unclassified way to brief their client on the contents of the classified information so he knew the full scope of the evidence.\n\nThey had \"one hand tied behind their backs,\" Antonipillai said.\n\nThe judges hearing the case and the Justice Department attorney pointed out he probably would have received some of that material if he had gone to trial instead of pleading guilty.\n\n\"It is his choice to pull the plug\" on the process and plead guilty, Gingras said.\n\nAnother argument made by Moussaoui's team was that he was denied the right of counsel because he could not hire a lawyer he wanted. After telling the court he did not want the court-appointed attorneys to represent him, Moussaoui tried to be his own attorney. But after constant outbursts the judge ended that effort.\n\nThe court-appointed lawyers then took over the defense, but Moussaoui never had a good relationship with them. He wanted a Muslim lawyer from Texas, Charles Freeman, to be his attorney, but Freeman did not have security clearance.\n\nMoussaoui was arrested in August of 2001 in Minnesota after instructors at the flight school he was attending reported he was acting suspiciously and did not have much flying experience. Throughout his legal proceedings he changed his story -- at first claiming he was not supposed to be part of the September 11 attacks and then saying he was scheduled to fly a fifth plane that day and then reversing himself back to his original claim of non-involvement.\n\nHis sentencing trial, which included evidence collected by the FBI relating to the 9/11 attacks, was supposed to showcase how a high-profile terrorism suspect could be tried in federal civilian court. But his trial ended up delayed for several years over a series of legal fights, including his attempt to defend himself, which included rants in the courtroom and the defense trying to gain testimony from some of the high-ranking al Qaeda detainees in U.S. custody.\n\nSeveral relatives of those who died in the 9/11 attacks traveled to Richmond for the hearing. Rosemary Dillard, whose husband was on the plane that went into the Pentagon, told CNN, \"People need to know this process works.\" Abraham Scott, whose wife worked in the Pentagon, said attending the hearing shows \"we are still interested. ... We are still supporting the legal process.\" Both Dillard and Scott attended every day of the 2006 sentencing trial.\n\nWith the prospect that more terrorism suspects could be tried in federal courts with the promised closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Dillard and Scott say Moussaoui's case shows the civilian trials can work.\n\nHowever, the appeal judges grappled with such key questions as how to guarantee a terrorism detainee access to classified information without compromising national security, and how to determine what degree of involvement in a terrorist plot is needed to justify a death sentence.\n\nAnalysts say some detainees, because of evidence and other reasons, should be brought to trial in other systems.\n\n\"The extraordinary challenges of balancing national security with the rights of a terrorism defendant in a civilian trial vividly illustrate why the new administration should consider the use of military tribunals for at least some of the Guantanamo detainees,\" said former U.S. attorney Coffey.",

  "context": "New York (CNN) -- As snow fell across New York Harbor, Isabel Belarsky clutched her mother, Clara, aboard a passenger ship that puttered toward Ellis Island and wondered what their new lives would bring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year was 1930. About a week earlier, the 10-year-old girl from what is now called St. Petersburg, Russia, had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her Ukrainian parents from the French port city of Cherbourg, escaping what she described as Jewish persecution at the start of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an island near Manhattan stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a wonderful sight,\" she said of the Statue of Liberty, which marked its 125th anniversary Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea for the monument is thought to have been conceived at a 19th-century dinner party among French aristocrats, historians say, who sought to pay tribute to American liberty.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while the French gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics, for many, it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in America's post- Civil War period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The arrival on Ellis Island is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you,\" said Belarksy, now a 91-year-old widow living in a Russian enclave of Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, according to the U.S. National Park Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjacent to Ellis towers Lady Liberty, measuring more than 305 feet from base to torch.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally, the statue was supposed to be an Egyptian peasant girl that would have stood at the entrance of Egypt's then-new Suez Canal, but plans would evolve into the Roman goddess who would instead adorn New York Harbor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sculptor, (Frederic) Bartholdi, was very clever,\" said Edward Berenson, professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He put (the statue) where he did because it's right at the narrows of New York Harbor, so he knew that every boat that came into New York would have to come really close to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople felt like they could reach out and touch it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired perhaps by Egypt's colossal statues during his own travels to Cairo, Berenson noted, Bartholdi sought to build a monument of his own in a tribute to American liberty and its newfound emancipation of the slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statue rests atop a sculpted wrangling of broken chains on New York's Liberty Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly years later, Berenson argues, did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public, despite the structure's engraved plaque bearing the now-famous poem by Emma Lazarus, asking for the \"huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many who made the perilous journey, Belarsky said, she had often wondered what kind of life was waiting for her on the shores behind the monument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was quite frightening,\" she recalled. \"The three of us, my father, my mother and I, wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us what's next.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd though a U.S. law passed six years earlier had largely restricted immigration, her father, Sidor, had managed to secure three tickets to America by way of a talent scout who visited the Leningrad conservatory where he had performed as an opera singer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He had such a beautiful voice,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir travel permit, however, was only temporary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSidor had acquired a six-month visa to teach at Brigham Young University, Belarsky said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young family would nonetheless settle more permanently in a west Manhattan apartment. And unlike many who eventually returned to their homelands in Europe, the Belarskys decided to leave St. Petersburg -- then known as Leningrad -- behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Authorities were starting to clamp down and consolidate the social state and Soviet power around Stalin,\" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \"As an opera singer, you might not have wanted to start singing Soviet anthems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the young family left Russia without plans to return, Belarsky added.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd though many immigrants entered the United States through Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami, historians say steamship companies most often cruised into New York Harbor, commonly making the Statue of Liberty the first land sighting for new arrivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody spoke of the golden land,\" Belarksy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" 'Come to America, where there's gold on the streets,' until they came here and they had to live in walk-up tenement houses,\" she said, referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as America's need for industrial labor grew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you think immigration is unpopular now,\" Berenson said, \"if anything, it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessive immigrant waves, however, still rushed to America's shores through Ellis Island and past the Statue of Liberty, often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it took a while for people to think of themselves as Americans,\" Berenson said. \"For an awful lot of people, what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally and as Americans too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnniversary celebrations of the Statue of Liberty were marked Friday by a series of official speeches and an array of webcams, provided by Earthcam, that streamed video footage from the torch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statue will close for renovations starting Saturday, though Liberty Island will remain open, according to the National Park Service.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Supreme Court justices on opposite sides of the ideological aisle exchanged tough words Monday over the fate of a Florida murderer who has been on death row for 32 years.\n\n\n\nSiding with the court's majority, Justice Clarence Thomas described brutal details of a Florida slaying.\n\n\n\nThe high court has refused to hear the appeal of William Thompson, who had plead guilty twice in the March 1976 kidnapping and torture-murder of a woman. His case and subsequent appeals have been litigated since, but a new execution date has not been set.\n\n\n\nA key part of his request to be spared lethal injection is that three decades as a capital inmate constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\n\n\"Our experience during the past three decades has demonstrated that delays in state-sponsored killings are inescapable and that executing defendants after such is unacceptably cruel,\" said Justice John Paul Stevens, who disagreed with the court's decision to allow the execution to proceed. He was supported by Justice Stephen Breyer in his objection to the court's ruling on Monday in the case, Thompson v. McNeil (08-7369).\n\n\n\nBut Justice Clarence Thomas took issue with his colleagues' conclusions. \"It is the crime and not the punishment imposed by the jury or the delay in execution that was 'unacceptably cruel,'\" he responded.\n\n\n\nThomas took time in his concurrence to detail the graphic crime that led to the conviction of Thompson and his co-defendant.\n\n\n\nThe men had held Sally Ivester and another woman in a motel room and were demanding money from the victim's families. Ivester had promised she could raise hundreds of dollars but was only able to secure $25. That enraged the men who savagely beat the woman with a belt, chair leg and nightstick, causing internal injuries. She was also burned with cigarettes.\n\n\n\nThe other woman witnessed the murder and said she feared for her life if she tried to leave.\n\n\n\nThompson and his co-defendant both pleaded guilty but the state's high court initially tossed out Thompson's sentence. The man's lawyer had told the defendant if he accepted responsibility for the crime, he would not get the death penalty, a crucial mistake.\n\n\n\nThompson later pleaded guilty a second time and again received a capital sentence. Then he began a series of appeals, claiming ineffective counsel, trial errors, limited mental capacity and a dysfunctional childhood. All those factors were ultimately rejected by state and federal courts.\n\n\n\nStevens noted that during a third penalty hearing, five members of a state advisory jury recommended against lethal injection, but the court again imposed death.\n\n\n\nThe circumstances of his current imprisonment, said Stevens, no longer justify such a sentence.\n\n\n\n\"As he awaits execution, petitioner has endured especially severe conditions of confinement,\" said Stevens, \"spending up to 23 hours per day in isolation in a 6- by 9-foot cell. Two death warrants have been signed against him and stayed only shortly before he was scheduled to die. The dehumanizing effects of such treatment are undeniable.\"\n\n\n\nBut Thomas said all such inmates are subjected to a \"restricted confinement\" because of the security risks they pose. And the prisoner had only himself to blame for his prolonged imprisonment on death row.\n\n\n\nQuoting his conclusions from a similar 1999 capital case, Thomas said, \"I remain unaware of any support in the American constitutional tradition of this Court's precedence for the proposition that a defendant can avail himself of the panoply of appellate and collateral procedures and then complain when his execution is delayed.\"\n\n\n\nThomas has long backed the right of states to impose death sentences. Stevens, who as a newly seated justice cast a key 1976 vote upholding the death penalty, has since grown increasingly frustrated with how it its carried out. Last April, he declared his open opposition to it.\n\n\n\n\"I have relied on my own experience in reaching the conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty represents the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes,\" he wrote. \"A penalty with such negligible returns to the state (is) patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\n\n\nThe 88-year-old justice was supported by three of his more liberal colleagues. But Stevens also said he would respect court precedents in favor of capital punishment.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Peruvian authorities say they have arrested four members of a gang that specialized in selling to European labs fat obtained from dead humans.\n\n\n\nOfficials are investigating the disappearance of at least 60 people they believe were killed by gang members in two mountainous states in central Peru, lead prosecutor Jorge Sanz Quiroz said Friday.\n\n\n\nThe four suspects have been charged with murder in the September slaying of a Peruvian man, the prosecutor said.\n\n\n\n\"They killed to obtain human fat because there were European laboratories that would pay them,\" Sanz Quiroz said.\n\n\n\nThe suspects told authorities they were paid $15,000 for a liter (about 1 quart) of human fat.\n\n\n\nOfficials did not disclose what possible use laboratories could have for the human fat, but fat can be a component of cosmetics and is used in reconstructive or cosmetic surgery. The use of human fat for any purpose is extremely rare, however, physicians say.\n\n\n\nOther suspects, including the Peruvian ringleader, have eluded capture, Sanz Quiroz said.\n\n\n\nAuthorities have the names of two Italian suspects who are being sought by Interpol, the 188-nation worldwide police agency, the prosecutor said. He declined to reveal their identities.\n\n\n\nSanz Quiroz acknowledged the uniqueness of the allegations.\n\n\n\n\"We are not making this up,\" he said. \"They have confessed to this. That's what's coming out now.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the suspects told officials he had been committing the murders for five years.\n\n\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint Sanz Quiroz filed November 18, officials discovered on September 22 a small container containing a fat-like substance that had been stored at the Bella Durmiente bus station in Lima, Peru's capital.\n\n\n\nOn November 3, the complaint says, suspect Serapio Marcos Veramendi Principe was arrested after he retrieved three bottles from the Estrella Polar bus station. The bottles contained a substance authorities believe is human fat, the complaint says. Lab tests are being performed to determine what the substance is.\n\n\n\nAuthorities identified the three other suspects as Elmer Segundo Castillejos Aguero, Hilario Cudena Simon and Enedina Estela Claudio. The suspects identified each other for police in photo lineups, the complaint says.\n\n\n\nIn addition to murder, Veramendi Principe and Castillejos Aguero face weapons charges. Castillejos Aguero, Veramendi Principe and Estela Claudio also face drug charges, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThey are accused in the September 16 killing of Abel Matos Aranda, the criminal complaint says. Authorities believe the substance found at the bus stations is body fat obtained from Matos Aranda.\n\n\n\nOfficials unearthed a partially buried male body November 13 in Huanuco state. They believe it was Matos Aranda.\n\n\n\nSanz Quiroz referred to the suspects as \"brujos,\" the Spanish word for witches. He noted that the suspects are part of an Andean mountain culture that believes bodies can be used to ward off evil and prevent disasters.\n\n\n\nFor example, he said, bodies are often buried at the entrances to mine shafts and bridges in the belief they will keep the structures from collapsing.\n\n\n\nAuthorities are calling the suspects \"pishtacos,\" which are Andean mythological creatures.\n\n\n\nIn his 1996 book \"Death in the Andes,\" Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa mentions pishtacos extensively, saying they are half-white ghouls who live in caves, lurk along dark isolated roads and suck the fat out of anyone careless enough to travel Andean roads at night. Andean myth holds that the fat is used to make soaps, lubricants, healing potions and cosmetic creams.\n\n\n\nUntil the arrests, few believed that anything resembling pishtacos existed.\n\n\n\n\"It's an Andean myth that we've now been able to prove,\" said Miguel Jimenez Torres, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.\n\n\n\nSome physicians say human fat is used in some medical procedures, but a few products were taken off the market because they were considered unsafe.\n\n\n\nThe longevity of implants that use human tissue often is not as good, said Atlanta cosmetic surgeon Harold Brody. Nor is there any advantage, he said, to using human fat in cosmetic creams or lotions.\n\n\n\n\"They're a little behind the times,\" Brody said. \"It makes a great moisturizer, but it has no advantages over good moisturizers that don't use human fat.\"\n\n\n\nNew York dermatologist Barry Goldman said he had never heard of human fat being sold on the black market.\n\n\n\n\"The idea that anybody would use an injectable where you didn't know where it came from would be laughable if it weren't unethical and potentially dangerous,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStill, the notion of black market human fat seemed possible to him.\n\n\n\n\"They steal kidneys, so why not this?\" he asked. \"It is sick, but in the Holocaust they did use skin for lamps.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- For most of American history, a Supreme Court with no Protestant Christian judges would have been unthinkable. Nearly three quarters of all justices who've ever served on the nation's high court have been Protestant. And roughly half of all Americans identify themselves as Protestant today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since John Paul Stevens announced his retirement last month, legal and religious scholars have begun entertaining the unprecedented prospect of a Supreme Court without a single Protestant justice.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides Stevens, who is Protestant, the current Supreme Court counts six Catholics and two Jews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an amazing irony given how central Protestantism has been to American culture,\" said Stephen Prothero, a religion scholar at Boston University. \"For most of the 19th century, Protestants were trying to turn America into their own heaven on Earth, which included keeping Jews and Catholics from virtually all positions of power.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany religion scholars attribute the decline of Protestants on the high court to the breakdown of a mainline Protestant identity and to the absence of a strong tradition of lawyering among evangelical Protestants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mainline Protestantism isn't a pressure group,\" said Prothero, \"It's not like the National Council of Churches is lobbying Obama to get a Lutheran appointed to the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while Judaism and Catholicism have their own sets of religious laws that date back millennia, many branches of Protestant Christianity do not. For much of the last 150 years, evangelical Christianity has stressed an emotional theology of \"heart\" over \"head\" -- not a recipe for producing legal scholars with eyes fixed on the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Evangelicals have put more effort into getting elected than in getting onto the bench,\" said Michael Lindsay, a Rice University professor who has studied evangelical elites. \"Electoral politics is more similar to the style of rallying of around revival campaign than it is to the arduous journey of producing intellectual giants that could be eligible for the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama is expected to nominate Stevens' replacement early this month. Of the three candidates who are reported to lead Obama's short list, two -- Solicitor General Elena Kagan and federal appeals judge Merrick Garland -- are Jewish, while one, federal appeals judge Diane Wood, is a Protestant.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama's first Supreme Court appointee, Sonia Sotomayor, is Catholic.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne explanation of Catholics' and Jews' high court hegemony is that members of both traditions have long pursued legal degrees as a way to assimilate into a majority Protestant country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most American Catholic law schools were not formed to be elite institutions of lofty legal scholarship, but as way to respond to the fact that other law schools were excluding Catholics,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. \"It was a vehicle to get Catholics into the middle class.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Early on, those schools admitted a lot of Jewish students who were being discriminated against,\" Garnett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Catholic law schools at Georgetown University, Fordham University, and Notre Dame are considered among the best in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvangelical Protestant colleges, meanwhile -- including Regent University and Liberty University, founded by Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, respectively -- have opened law schools only since the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd law schools with Protestant roots -- like Harvard and Yale -- shed their religious identities a long time ago, part of the broader fading of a distinct mainline Protestant identity in the U.S..\n\n\n\n\n\nSome legal and religious scholars say the dearth of qualified evangelical candidates for the Supreme Court came into sharp relief in 2005, when President George W. Bush nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to the high court.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn evangelical Christian who the White House promoted strenuously among evangelicals, Miers' nomination was brought down largely by conservatives -- nonevangelicals, mostly -- who said she was not qualified for the position.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last couple of decades, however, more evangelicals have begun pursuing legal degrees, including at elite colleges. \"There are now vibrant Christian fellowships at Harvard and Yale,\" said Lindsay. \"Ten years from now, it will be entirely possible to see an evangelical Protestant on the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel Heflin, a senior at Patrick Henry College -- a Virginia school whose students are mostly evangelicals from homeschooling backgrounds -- said many of her friends are heading to law school next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When your circle of friends is comprised of aspiring lawyers, the joke is about who's going to make it to the high court first,\" said Heflin, an evangelical Christian who will be attending George Washington University Law School on scholarship.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich means that a Protestant Supreme Court resurgence may not be too far off.",

Rod Blagojevich tops new CNN poll of which politician has been the naughtiest of 2008.\n\n\n\nFifty-six percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday said Blagojevich, who has been arrested on corruption charges, was the naughtiest politician in 2008.\n\n\n\nBlagojevich, accused of attempting to sell President-elect Barack Obama's former Senate seat, has said he has done nothing wrong and plans to fight the allegations.\n\n\n\nThe poll also found 23 percent believed former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer should get the nod, followed by 19 percent for former presidential candidate John Edwards.\n\n\n\nSpitzer resigned in March after it was revealed he was Client No. 9 in a high-end prostitution ring. In November, prosecutors announced they would not be bringing criminal charges against Spitzer.\n\n\n\nEdwards, who had been considered a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, admitted in August to having an extramarital affair with former campaign staffer Rielle Hunter. The former North Carolina senator also denied he was the father of Hunter's then-newborn baby.\n\n\n\nCNN polling director Keating Holland said while Blagojevich's top spot in the survey may be due to his arrest occurring more recently than the transgressions of the others, there may be another reason. iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders?\n\n\n\n\"Americans typically take a much dimmer view of corruption than of sex scandals, since the former is a violation of the public trust and the latter is usually considered more of a private matter,\" he said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Age has slowed Sonic, the beloved blue hero from an earlier generation of video games, but Sega may have finally rehabilitated the venerable hedgehog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sonic Generations,\" which arrives in stores Tuesday for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, comes at an opportune time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a crucial holiday season imminent, Sega Sammy Holdings hasn't produced a stellar Sonic game in about a decade, and the company's game division has performed especially sluggishly this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut \"Sonic Generations,\" coming on the 20th anniversary of the franchise, looks like a promising candidate to buck these trends. The first batch of reviews have been positive, and the game has received more preorders than any previous Sonic game, which is an early barometer for success.\n\n\n\n\n\nSega also managed to build some buzz for the game at video game expos like E3, although those conventions have not been particularly kind to other Sonic games.\n\n\n\n\n\nEncouraged by the favorable feedback, Sega is throwing its marketing weight behind the game. These initiatives include traditional advertising, constructing a Sonic-themed playground in East Oakland, California, and a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" debuted on Sega's Genesis game system in 1991. Since the heydays of Sega going head-to-head with Nintendo for home console domination, the company has ceased selling hardware, started developing\u00c2\u00a0for multiple systems and merged with Sammy, which makes pachinko slot machines in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps as a result, Sega's flagship franchise, which is developed by the aptly named Sonic Team, has slumped. Sonic's and Mario's \"platformer\" genre -- in which cartoonish characters navigate increasingly challenging maze-like levels -- was once a blockbuster seller, but it's been surpassed by first-person shooters such as \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield.\" Nintendo has managed to maintain the high quality of Mario games over the years, but Sega has struggled to remake Sonic for the fast-paced 21st-century game industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sonic Generations\" is designed to \"take Sonic back to the pure elements,\" Yasuhiro Noguchi, a senior producer who led development on the Western version of the game, said in an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome previous games in the series became preoccupied with elaborate story lines and slower-paced exploration. American and European players may have been put off by elements of the plots that were geared toward audiences in Japan, where Sonic Team is based.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The team tries very hard not to bias it for a particular territory,\" Noguchi said. \"They don't necessarily do stuff that is very, very specific to, say, their home territory. That's one of the learnings that has kind of informed their development DNA in the last 20 years -- that Sonic is loved internationally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \"Sonic Generations\" and its predecessor, \"Sonic Colors\" for the Wii, Sega recruited writers from the television show \"Happy Tree Friends.\" They pen straightforward scripts that they hope will resonate with players outside of Asia, where Sonic's market is bigger. However, the writers must also adhere to standards set by Sega's Japan-based Sonic Committee, which is tasked with upholding the integrity of the Sonic brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sonic is a beloved franchise,\" Noguchi said. \"Disney has Mickey, and we have Sonic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sonic Generations\" is looking to polish the franchise's legacy and reverse the recent decline of Sonic's popularity, said Patrick Riley, a U.S.-based development director for the company. \"I think that fans recognize that as far as the quality, Sonic is moving in the right direction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game melds the classic two-dimensional action with three-dimensional exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're truly bringing the 'A game' on 'Sonic Generations,' \" Noguchi said. \"In some ways, it is sort of a celebration and a sendoff for the first generation of Sonic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sonic Generations\" will dip into past successes in its attempt to rebuild the franchise. Levels from classic Sonic games, such as the memorable Green Hill Zone, have been remade in 3-D. A dash of nostalgia may be just what Sega needs to reinvigorate its aging hedgehog.",

About 7,500 troops will remain in Juarez at least for another six months at the mayor's request, officials said.\n\n\n\nThe army presence has helped curb the violent daylight shootouts that damaged the city's image and threatened its economy, but killings and reprisals among street-level dealers continue to mount, Belmonte said.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, 635 new police officers graduated from the police academy and joined the ranks of a force that had been thinned by about 700 in the city's effort to root out corrupt cops.\n\n\n\nThe police department is now up to more than 2,600 officers, Belmonte said. Another 400 cadets are expected to join the force in October.\n\n\n\nOfficials hope that the larger police force, together with investments in police equipment and a new crime-stoppers phone system, will turn things around for the city.\n\n\n\nMore than 5,100 have been killed in drug-cartel violence across Mexico this year, according to a tally by the newspaper El Universal.",

  "context": "ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- Amanda Knox will testify Friday in an Italian courtroom to defend herself against charges that she took part in the killing of her roommate two years ago, her lawyer said.\n\n\n\nAmerican college student Amanda Knox, 21, is expected to take the witness stand Friday at her Italian murder trial.\n\n\n\nKnox, 21, an American college student from Seattle, Washington, will be questioned by her attorneys first and her testimony could continue Saturday, said Luciano Ghriga, one of her lawyers.\n\n\n\nThe trial against Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 24, began January 16 in Perugia, a university town about 185 kilometers (115 miles) north of Rome.\n\n\n\nThey are charged with murder and sexual assault in the November 2007 slaying of Knox's roommate, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, who died in what prosecutors called a \"drug-fueled sex game\" with the couple.\n\n\n\nA third person, Rudy Hermann Guede, from the Ivory Coast, was convicted of murder in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\n\n\nKercher was found dead in her bed, half-naked, with a knife wound to her neck. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her.\n\n\n\nProsecutors say they have physical evidence placing the defendants at the scene, and that they gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died.\n\n\n\nKnox first said she was at the house she shared with Kercher, then changed her story, according to court records. Sollecito, meanwhile, said he was never at the house, but was at his apartment, watching a movie on his computer with Knox. Later, he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night.\n\n\n\nDefense lawyers are expected to argue that the physical evidence was tainted by sloppy police work.\n\n\n\nThe case is being heard by a panel of eight judges. The trial has drawn more than 140 journalists from 86 news outlets to the courthouse in Perugia, Italy.\n\n\n\nThe presiding judge in the case, Giancarlo Massei, has barred cameras from the courtroom and said he could completely close portions of the trial dealing with the most graphic sexual assault allegations.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- He has been at the center of Asia's biggest sex scandal, but now actor Edison Chen has broken his silence on the public episode that has ended careers and caused him to face at least one reported death threat.\n\n\n\nInternet sex photos of Edison Chen and starlets caused a huge media storm and fall from grace for many.\n\n\n\nTalking exclusively to CNN on his return to Hong Kong, where he had been forging a career in the movies, Chen reveals his side of the scandal that broke in early last year when hundreds of sexually explicit photos of Chen with other celebrities turned up on the Internet.\n\n\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk through the past year and a half about this or that and a lot of rumors, a lot of hearsay, and I feel, you know, I've kept quiet just to kind of respect everyone and respect the law,\" Chen told CNN.\n\n\n\nA Hong Kong computer technician was sentenced to more than eight-and-a-half months in jail for dishonestly obtaining access to the intimate photos when Chen sent his computer in for repairs. But it is still unclear exactly how the images made their way to the web.\n\n\n\nWatch the full exclusive TV interview with Edison Chen online \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe photographs caused shock in Hong Kong and across Asia, with around 1,300 salacious images fueling front page news for tabloids for weeks.\n\n\n\nThere was also a huge public backlash against the 28-year-old who has been one of the rising young stars of Asia cinema. After the scandal broke, Chen, who admitted taking the photos, announced his retirement from Hong Kong's entertainment business and fled to his native Canada.\n\n\n\nAdded to the media attention, Chen says he faced death threats. A bullet was sent to a TV station in Hong Kong earlier this year warning the entertainer to stay out of the limelight. While Chen issued his own apology for any hurt or embarrassment caused soon after the photos surfaced, he maintains he suffered as well.\n\n\n\n\"I believed I was a victim. I believed that I was hurt by this a lot. I believed that...I knew that I had nothing to do with the spreading of these photos,\" he told CNN in the exclusive interview.\n\n\n\n\"I can't say I didn't do anything wrong. I've admitted that I was wrong, and I wouldn't say sorry if I wasn't wrong. But I also believe that at the same time that I wasn't the perpetrator, and I had suffered a lot from this as well.\"\n\n\n\nChen has suffered a spectacular fall from grace and some of the starlets in the photos have endured public disgrace in this culturally conservative region. For some, careers have been left in ruins.\n\n\n\nChen says he has not spoken to any of the women identified in the photos since the scandal broke. \"Initially it was because I couldn't find them. Secondly, it was because I didn't really know how to approach and really what to say to be honest with you,\" Chen told CNN.\n\n\n\nCecilia Cheung was one of the actresses identified in the photos and in a recent interview, she had strong criticism for Chen.\n\n\n\n\"I wasn't allowed to talk to her in the initial because of the police request and they were investigating me...I had so much things on my mind,\" said Chen.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not trying to say that that justifies any wrongdoing that she thinks I've done to her. But I hope that she can understand, and I hope that she can forgive me either today or one day, and she'll understand that I had my difficulties, and I really, really never wished this to happen upon anyone, and I still respect her.\"\n\n\n\nWatch the full exclusive TV interview with Edison Chen online. \u00bb Chen talks at length to CNN's Anjali Rao about the women involved in the photographs, why he took the images, the effect the scandal had on his health, his family and others.",

  "context": "Editor's note: CNN executive producer Suzanne Simons is the author of \"Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War.\"\n\n\n\nPrivate contractor Xe flies military personnel in Afghanistan and helps train Afghan border police.\n\n\n\nThe company formerly known as Blackwater, now called Xe much to its chagrin, has been at the center of the contractor debate for years.\n\n\n\nFrom the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, to a shooting involving a team of its men in a Baghdad neighborhood in which at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in 2007, the company has drawn unwanted headlines.\n\n\n\nBlackwater owner Erik Prince downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment. He changed the company's name after the Iraqi government banned it from doing business there. But those who thought contractors were going away under President Obama's administration couldn't be more wrong.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Defense, there are some 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan today and more than 132,000 in Iraq. But those numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they don't include those working for other government agencies such as the Department of State.\n\n\n\nMany of those tens of thousands are third-country nationals, meaning they were hired from a third country to go to Iraq. Many earn between $400 and $700 a month; while Americans, particularly those performing dangerous security duties, can earn as much in a day.\n\n\n\nDespite being kicked out of Iraq, Xe still does a healthy business in Afghanistan, flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train Afghan border police charged with making the country's massive, porous borders more secure. It's one of the many jobs that the U.S. military just isn't staffed to tackle on its own.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the U.S. military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors. There are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors. And that's the problem. The U.S. has come to rely on them so heavily, in such a short period of time, that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately.\n\n\n\nEven among the eight-member team that makes up the Wartime Contracting Commission, a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in Iraq and Afghanistan, the question of whether the United States needs the contractors isn't even an issue. The issue, rather, is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in Iraq.\n\n\n\nIn its interim report released this month, the Commission found that \"neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts.\" The report also said, \"the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions. The decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed-security and life-support tasks for military units.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern-day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur. That has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the FBI, as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas.\n\n\n\nDoug Brooks, head of the IPOA, an industry-friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies, spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards. \"We have the power to kick people out of the association,\" Brooks said, but that's about where it ends. They can't prosecute anyone.  But to say that there has been no progress on the legal front wouldn't be fair. Legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, but with everything in this business, there was a hang-up with that, too.  The legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the Department of Defense, but there are even more contractors working in support of the State Department and other U.S. agencies.\n\n\n\nThe Special Inspector General for Iraq, Stuart W. Bowen Jr. produced a report in February titled Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience. He then testified before Congress that \"the United States government was unprepared and ill-equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in Iraq in 2003. For the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve.\"\n\n\n\nHe also told members of Congress that the United States relies too heavily on the hired help, testifying that \"outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations.\" Something that retired Lt. Gen. Richard Sanchez would undoubtedly agree with.   Sanchez, who led the U.S. military operation in the early days of the Iraq war, has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate. He's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees.   Guess what. Contractors were involved in that scandal, too.\n\n\n\nAs for Blackwater, scandal, or the suspicion of it, played a significant role in its downturn. Plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations, the company now called Xe is a shell of what Blackwater was five years ago. Most of Prince's top executives are gone, budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots, as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces.   Is Blackwater's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry? Hardly.\n\n\n\nAs IPOA's Brooks puts it, they're here to stay, its about time we made it work. \"I think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we're going to be working with the private sector. Nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs, guarding gates, that kind of thing.\"",

  "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Three of five Americans contractors detained in Baghdad have been ordered released by an Iraqi judge, because of insufficient evidence, a court spokesman said Thursday.\n\n\n\nIn a CNN exclusive, video shows U.S. contractors taken into custody by Iraqi authorities.\n\n\n\nThe other two other contractors remain in custody, according to Judge Abdul Sattar al-Beeraqdar, a spokesman for Iraq's Higher Judicial Council.\n\n\n\nOne of the men has been released on bond, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad confirmed Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe embassy did not identify the man, who was released Wednesday. However, a spokesman for his employer, Corporate Training Unlimited, said it was Donald Feeney. Judy Feeney, Donald's wife, also confirmed his release.\n\n\n\nThe contracting company said the release of the others has been delayed because of a procedural issue.\n\n\n\nJudy Feeney said her son, Donald Feeney III, and Mark Bridges were to be released Thursday morning, but it may take more time to release the other two, Jason Jones and Micah Milligan.\n\n\n\nBut al-Beeraqdar said, without naming names, that two contractors were being held on charges involving \"illegal substances\" found on the men when they were taken into custody.\n\n\n\nThose who have been released are not allowed to leave the country because of an ongoing investigation and the judge may want to question them again, according to al-Beeraqdar.\n\n\n\nExcept for Jones, the detained contractors work for the Fayetteville, North Carolina-based CTU, a security firm headed by the elder Feeney.\n\n\n\nAn Iraqi judge decided earlier on Wednesday that charges against the five contractors were not warranted and that they could be released, according to an Iraqi security source and a source close to the five.\n\n\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, in which the contractors have been detained since last week for reasons that remain unclear.\n\n\n\nThe contractors initially had been told they were being held in connection with the May death of another contractor, James Kitterman, said the source close to the five.\n\n\n\nBut on Monday, according to a judicial source, the men were told they were being held on suspicion of having unregistered weapons.\n\n\n\nStill, they were asked about their activities around the time Kitterman was killed, and Iraqi government officials told CNN Monday the five were detained as suspects in connection with Kitterman's slaying.\n\n\n\nKitterman was found bound, blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in Baghdad's Green Zone on May 22. The 60-year-old Houston, Texas, resident owned a construction company that operated in Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe Green Zone is the high-security area in central Baghdad that contains the U.S. Embassy and key Iraqi government buildings. Access to the area, formally known as the International Zone, is tightly controlled.\n\n\n\nThe five contractors were taken into custody on June 3 in a pre-dawn Green Zone raid by Iraqi and U.S. personnel, the security source told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\n\nDuring the raid, troops also confiscated weapons, the Iraqi security source said. Three of the contractors were suspected of being directly involved in Kitterman's death, the Iraqi source said.\n\n\n\nA U.S. Embassy spokesman said the search was an Iraqi operation, but FBI representatives were present at the request of Iraqi authorities.\n\n\n\nThe five were transferred to a prison within the Green Zone on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"After this murder inside the Green Zone, a joint investigation committee from U.S. and Iraq sides has been formed to investigate this incident,\" Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Karim Khalaf told CNN, \"and this committee managed to collect a number of indications that those five are linked to this murder.\"\n\n\n\nIraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh also said the men were detained based on information linking them to the Kitterman slaying.\n\n\n\nUnder Iraqi law, after a person is detained, an investigative judge questions the accused and assesses the evidence. The judge then decides whether there is sufficient evidence, and either refers the case to trial or dismisses it.\n\n\n\nThe Iraqi source said the five had been held in a separate holding area and not with other Iraqi detainees, but spent time in a courtyard with other Iraqi detainees. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said consular officials had visited with them and \"they appeared well.\"\n\n\n\nThe source close to the suspects said Sunday that each of the five men insisted they had alibis that will clear them and they were eager to tell their stories to a judge.\n\n\n\nThe Feeneys had known Kitterman for six years from their time in the Green Zone and \"respected him,\" Corporate Training Unlimited spokeswoman Sarah Smith told CNN.\n\n\n\nCNN's Alan Duke in Los Angeles and Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN Traveller) -- When the Roman Emperor Hadrian came to power in 117AD he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams.\n\n\n\nA massive bust of Hadrian's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the British Museum.\n\n\n\nOne of his first acts was to pull the troops out of Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the British Museum\"s superb exhibition \"Hadrian: Empire and Conflict\" which opens on 24 July under the imposing classical dome of the Reading Room.\n\n\n\nCurator Torsten Opper says: \"No matter what our take is on the conflict in Iraq today, we can relate to Hadrian's decision. Maybe 10 or 15 years ago, it wouldn't have mattered so much. Now it does.\"\n\n\n\nHadrian was born in Rome to a noble family whose origins lay in Spain.\n\n\n\nOne of the greatest of Rome's emperors, he consolidated imperial power, was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands.\n\n\n\nThough married, he also took a homosexual lover, Antinous, whose drowning in the river Nile on the very day Egyptians were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god Osiris remains one of ancient history's great unsolved mysteries.\n\n\n\nThe range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well-attended. Visitors will, for example, be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at Sagalassos in central Turkey and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high.\n\n\n\n\"A year ago, this was still lying buried in the ground,\" says Opper. \"It\"s proof that Roman history isn't done and dusted; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it.\"\n\n\n\nThe exhibition brings together 180 objects, from 31 sources in 11 different countries.\n\n\n\n\"It hasn't been an easy thing to do,\" adds Opper.\n\n\n\n\"Many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate. This isn't an exhibition that can travel. People will only be able to view it for these three months.\"\n\n\n\nMany of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into Hadrian's reign. Between 132AD and 135/6AD the Jews of Judea rebelled against Roman rule. Some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert, called the cave of letters, in which they were trapped by Roman troops. Few made it out alive.\n\n\n\nThe climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition. There is a letter written by Jewish leader Simon Bar Kokhba (enquiring about a delivery of supplies), as well as mirrors, a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate, probably made in Alexandria, that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave.\n\n\n\nThen there are three house keys, their wooden handles preserved, looking as if they would still open the locks for which they were made.\n\n\n\nOpper says: \"They\"re immediately touching -- these were used by people to lock their homes thinking they\"d be back in a week or two, but of course they weren't -- they all perished. And there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in. It\"s a potent symbol of conflict.\"\n\n\n\nTo the British Hadrian will always be associated with the wall that was built across northern England, an 117km rampart with a fortification every 1.6km. In schoolroom history this has traditionally been seen as a defence against the barbarian tribes to the north, but it wasn't necessarily so.\n\n\n\n\"The wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes,\" says Opper.\n\n\n\nConfirmation of this, perhaps, comes from two small writing tablets from the fortress of Vindolanda, the oldest surviving hand-written documents in the British Isles.\n\n\n\nIn one an officer, presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post, derides the locals as the \"little British,\" not worthy of worrying about very much - brief, battered and faded the letter may be, but as an example of high-handed imperialism it is hard to beat.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to subscribe to CNN Traveller\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2008 INK PUBLISHING AND CABLE NEWS NETWORK, LP, LLLP, A TIME WARNER COMPANY.

The quake's epicenter was 10 km (6 miles) deep in the Pacific Ocean about 121 miles (194 km) from the city of Apia, Samoa.\n\n\n\nThe quake did not trigger a tsunami warning, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\n\n\nIt followed an 8.0-magnitude earthquake which hit the small cluster of Samoan islands early Tuesday triggering a tsunami.\n\n\n\nAt least 139 people are confirmed dead as a consequence of Tuesday's quake and tsunami. They include 22 people killed in American Samoa, 110 in Samoa and seven in Tonga, according to officials on the islands.\n\n\n\nA huge emergency effort was continuing late Wednesday in the Samoan islands and officials warned that the death toll could rise as rescue workers start to reach outlying villages and discover new casualties. Watch the tsunami take over the street \u00bb\n\n\n\nSurvivors like Ropati Opa were trying to find ways to cope. The massive waves had destroyed his home, store and gas station in the village of Leone on the southwest coast of American Samoa.\n\n\n\nWith tears in his eyes, he said \"I don't have a house. I don't have a car. I don't have money. I lost everything yesterday. But thank God I am alive.\" iReport.com: Witness describes tsunami hitting land\n\n\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama addressed the disaster at an event Wednesday in Washington.\n\n\n\n\"To aid in the response,\" he said, \"I've declared this a major disaster to speed the deployment of resources and FEMA ... is working closely with emergency responders on the ground, and the Coast Guard is working to provide immediate help to those in need.\n\n\n\n\"We also stand ready to help our friends in neighboring Samoa and throughout the region, and we'll continue to monitor this situation closely as we keep the many people who have been touched by this tragedy in our thoughts and in our prayers,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nJournalist Jeff DePonte contributed to this report.",

A red line was crossed for every athlete in the world -- politics should be kept separate from sports.\"\n\n\n\nThe governing body of women's tennis said it was \"deeply disappointed\" that Peer was being denied entry to the country hosting the tournament, but it did not cancel the competition, which began Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe move runs counter to WTA policy, which says no player should be barred from competing in a tournament for which she has qualified.\n\n\n\nDubai could lose its membership in the WTA tour next year over the ban on Peer, according to WTA rules. That would mean professional players could compete only in exhibition matches in Dubai, the results of which would not count in pro rankings.\n\n\n\nGovernment officials in Dubai have not responded to CNN's request to comment over their refusal to allow Peer to compete in the event.\n\n\n\n\"Ms. Peer has earned the right to play in the tournament, and it is regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right,\" said Larry Scott, chairman and chief executive of the tour.  Watch Scott express disappointment \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Following various consultations, the tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the tour's board of directors.\"\n\n\n\nThe patron of the Dubai Tennis Championships is Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Makhtoum. Two million dollars in prize money is on the line.\n\n\n\nAl-Makhtoum told CNN in 2004 that Dubai would accept Israeli students to a school dedicated to students from the Middle East who are talented at sports.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Dubai hosted World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, which Israeli government officials attended. The Israeli flag -- among other member states' flags -- is still part of a globe monument in Dubai.\n\n\n\nPeer, 21, is ranked 48th in the world among female tennis players. She was allowed to compete at the Doha tournament in Qatar last year, where she received a warm welcome, according to Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz.\n\n\n\nQatar, another Gulf Arab state, froze diplomatic ties with Israel after Israel's military offensive in Gaza last month.\n\n\n\nPeer downplayed the political undertones of her participation in last year's Doha tournament, telling Haaretz that she didn't come to Qatar \"to help the politics of course.\" But she added that if her playing in the tournament \"can help for peace or anything, I'd be really happy.\"\n\n\n\nScott said the tour will \"review appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer\" as well as \"appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament.\"\n\n\n\nPeer was advised Saturday by tournament and WTA officials of the denial of her visa while she was participating in a tournament in Pattaya, Thailand, according to a WTA statement.\n\n\n\nThe Dubai Tennis Championships runs through February 28.",

  "context": "(PEOPLE.com) -- Nearly two years after falling in love, \"American Idol\" alumni Ace Young and Diana DeGarmo are opening up about their relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 5 heartthrob Young, 31, and season 3's runner-up DeGarmo, 24, met in the spring of 2010 when both signed on to costar in the Broadway revival of the musical \"Hair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We became best friends through 'Hair,' ironically not through 'Idol,' \" says DeGarmo, who now plays as a New Jersey Mob boss's daughter on the CBS soap \"The Young and the Restless.\" \"It just blossomed into a beautiful relationship.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attraction was immediate for Young, who, along with DeGarmo, had to get naked onstage for each performance of \"Hair.\" \"She said, 'You're not looking, right?' \" Young says of the first time they disrobed in rehearsals. \"And I was like, 'Oh no, not at all.' But I was looking, and I was like -- sold!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Young had his eye on DeGarmo before that moment. \"I was already interested in her as a person before I got to see her with no clothes on,\" he said. \"But [that] sealed the deal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the musical closed in June 2010, Young, 31, returned to L.A. while DeGarmo, 24, went on tour with the musical \"9 to 5.\" The time apart was difficult, Young says: \"If you love somebody, whenever they're not around, it sucks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when DeGarmo's tour ended last summer, Young found a way to keep her close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She came to California and kept saying, 'I'm looking [at] apartments,' \" he recalls. \"And I was like, 'Why don't you just stay with me?' The moment she got here, she realized I wasn't going to let her get an apartment. It was like, either we're doing this or we're not. And, thankfully, she was all in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdds DeGarmo: \"I crashed on the couch -- more like, I crashed in his bed -- and just didn't leave.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese days, the couple's not only living under the same roof, but working together. They recently formed a music group with two friends called All Access, and Young, who earned a Grammy nomination for co-writing \"Idol\" pal Chris Daughtry's hit \"It's Not Over,\" is also producing country songs for DeGarmo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's my best friend,\" he says. \"To be able to dive in with Diana and help create songs that [tell] her story is amazing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the full article at PEOPLE.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2011 People and Time Inc.

Among the guests were politicians, mountaineers and friends.\n\n\n\nLady Hillary sat with family and Prime Minister Helen Clark. In the congregation were members of Nepal's Sherpa community and Buddhist monks.\n\n\n\nIn front of them, Hillary's coffin was draped in a New Zealand flag and covered in wreaths.  See photos of the funeral service \u00bb\n\n\n\nAs the service began, Sherpas laid Tibetan prayer scarves on the coffin. In Nepal, schools were due to ring bells as the service started.\n\n\n\nHillary's son, Peter, told the congregation: \"Adventure was compulsory growing up in the Hillary household. He took us to the most extraordinary places.\"\n\n\n\nHis daughter, Sarah spoke of a childhood where Sir Edmund was planning expeditions, and coming home to a family eager to see him again. \"When asked at primary school what my father did, I was unable to find an answer.\"\n\n\n\nClark said: \"He was a role model for a generation of New Zealanders... We mourn as a nation because we know we are saying goodbye to a friend.\"\n\n\n\nOn Monday, New Zealanders filed past Hillary's casket as they paid final respects in Auckland's Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral.\n\n\n\nFour soldiers, rifles at rest, stood guard as ordinary New Zealanders said goodbye to a national hero, whose achievements are known around the world.\n\n\n\nHillary's widow attended the tribute, which featured Maori song and dance. Clark, called it a celebration of a \"very great\" life.\n\n\n\nHillary, who was 88, died at Auckland City Hospital on January 11.\n\n\n\nOn May 29, 1953, Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa guide, became the first men to climb the 29,035 feet to the top of Everest and safely return.\n\n\n\nHillary, who served during World War II in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, began climbing while in high school and traveled to the central Himalayas to join a British party exploring the southern face of Everest in 1951.\n\n\n\nHe returned in 1953, when he and Norgay made their ascent -- spending 15-30 minutes at the summit.\n\n\n\nHe was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on his return to England, but continued exploring -- reaching the South Pole by tractor in 1958, joining the first group to climb Antarctica's Mount Herschel in 1967 and boating east Himalayan rivers and the Ganges.\n\n\n\nHis Himalayan Trust has helped build schools, hospitals and airstrips in Nepal since 1961. He was also a strong supporter of environmental causes and worked to improve the lives of Nepal's Sherpas. E-mail to a friend",

Korean army soldiers, back, look at a S. Korean soldier, center, in the demilitarized zone in June.\n\n\n\nPyongyang fired six short-range missiles in less than seven hours, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said.\n\n\n\nThe missiles were apparently Scud-type, estimated to have a range of about 500 kilometers (310 miles), according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.\n\n\n\nSouth Korean intelligence estimates that North Korea has about 700 such missiles in its arsenal.\n\n\n\nPyongyang test-fired four such missiles off the east coast Thursday, Yonhap reported.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea called the launches a provocative act, according to a government statement.\n\n\n\nNorth Korea had issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a \"military firing exercise,\" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN.\n\n\n\nThe recent firings come amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters.  Watch S. Korea confirm firing of missiles \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe first two missiles were fired about 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Yonhap reported. Another missile was launched about 10:45 a.m., the agency reported. A fourth one came some time after that.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Navy and other U.S. officials said they are ready to track any missiles.\n\n\n\n\"The United States is aware of possible missile launches by North Korea. We are closely monitoring North Korea's activities and intentions,\" a U.S. official said.\n\n\n\n\"This type of North Korea behavior is not helpful. What North Korea needs to do is fulfill its international obligations and commitments.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier this week analyst Daniel Pinkston said the reported test might be training for a future test but it could also just be a routine military exercise.\n\n\n\n\"It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch,\" said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n\n\n\"It's part of military training, but there seem to be no movements of troops or anything that would suggest preparations for military operations.\n\n\n\n\"So yes, people are watching it, the military is watching it here, but I don't think it's related to any plans or operations to attack anyone.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Sohn Jie-Ah in Seoul, Korea, and Charley Keyes in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report",

  "context": "Only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their employer-sponsored health insurance through the safety-net program COBRA, most likely because the premiums are too expensive, according to an analysis released Friday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that supports independent research on health care issues.\n\n\n\nOnly about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their insurance through the COBRA program.\n\n\n\nExperts worry that the highest unemployment rate in 16 years, combined with a health care system dependent on employer-sponsored health insurance, is a recipe for disaster, and will swell the ranks of the uninsured particularly if people aren't using COBRA. About 46 million people in the United States (18 percent of those under 65) lacked health insurance in 2007. Health.com: Laid off? The healthiest ways to spend your time\n\n\n\nThe new report is based on a 2007 survey of 3,501 people. The researchers found that two-thirds of workers, if they were laid off, would be eligible for COBRA. Data from 2006 data suggest that only 9 percent would opt into the program. Health care insurance premiums have risen since then, so it's likely that the problem is getting worse not better, they say.\n\n\n\n\"The affordability issue gets worse every year, that's the big concern,\" says Meredith Rosenthal, PhD., an associate professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. \"Of course [some people can] still get an offer of coverage through a spouse, but we're still talking about very, very serious increases in the number of uninsured.\" Health.com: Natural cold and flu remedies\n\n\n\nCOBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) was passed in 1985 to allow laid-off workers to continue their health insurance if they lose their job. (COBRA only covers workers in companies that offer health insurance, have 20 or more employees, and are still in business.)\n\n\n\nBut there's a catch. Most employers pick up 75 percent to 85 percent of the tab for their workers' health insurance, and once a person has been laid off, the entire bill falls on the ex-employee's shoulders. That means that health insurance costs dramatically escalate at a time when people have little or no money to burn.\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund estimates that the cost of COBRA is four to six times higher than what people pay when they are employed; $4,704 per year for an individual and $12,680 for a family. Health.com: Live healthy for way less\n\n\n\nErin McCullar, 26, of Birmingham, Alabama, has type 1 diabetes and was laid off from her job as an interior designer in October. At the time, she didn't sign up for COBRA, a decision she now seriously regrets. Overwhelmed, she didn't realize she had a 60 days to sign up for the program and missed the deadline by a couple of days.\n\n\n\n\"On the day I got laid off I got a packet slapped in front of my face and that was it,\" she says. \"I was just totally in the dark.\"\n\n\n\nShe quickly found out that she couldn't get health insurance that would cover her type 1 diabetes, at least without a six-month or year-long waiting period, because it is considered a preexisting condition.\n\n\n\nShe stockpiled a six-month supply of lifesaving insulin in the two-week period before she lost her job, but since then has scrimped on the drug to make it last longer. At one point, she even disconnected her pump, which delivers a continuous dose of insulin, for about three weeks. She used only a couple of insulin injections in that time to control high blood sugar, a potentially serious threat to her health.\n\n\n\nEven if she did sign up, she's not sure she could afford the premiums, which would have cost about $8,000 a year. Health.com: Healthy meals for under $10\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, yes, I need it, but cost did factor into it,\" she says. \"I don't know that I would have been able to keep up my payments because I was barely able to keep up on my rent.\"\n\n\n\nCost is clearly a major issue for most laid-off workers, says Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. Only 3 percent of workers near the poverty level who are eligible for COBRA opt to keep their insurance, compared to 14 percent of workers who made more money before they lost their job.\n\n\n\nIt's a problem that \"is not going away,\" says Davis, \"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that we're going to go to 8.3 percent unemployed in 2009 and 9 percent in 2010,\" says Davis. (The unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in December.)\n\n\n\nShe notes that each percentage point increase in the unemployment rate leads to a 1.1 million increase in the number of uninsured.\n\n\n\n\"So it's pretty urgent that the economic stimulus bill not only address the job situation, but address health insurance coverage too,\" she says.\n\n\n\nWhile some laid-off workers may get health insurance coverage though a spouse or partner, their research suggests that only about 14 percent of people who are not eligible for COBRA could get coverage through a partner or some other source after losing their job, she says.\n\n\n\nRosenthal and other experts hope that if there is a silver lining, it's that there may be more political will to change the current health care coverage system.\n\n\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges to health care coverage reform has been that the status quo is okay for many people, particularly for many people who vote,\" she says. \"If that is no longer true, and if the people who have coverage now are insecure enough, they may be willing to give up something to get coverage security.\"\n\n\n\nMcCullar just hopes she can get health insurance soon.\n\n\n\n\"It sounds just colossally stupid to not have heath insurance, but I luckily had enough vials and insulin so I'm not near running out now, but I have to get health insurance in the near future,\" she says. \"God forbid I had to go to the hospital during this; that would be a nightmare.\"\n\n\n\nEnter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com",

  "context": "Atlanta (CNN) -- A woman charged with sending threatening packages to two lawmakers, including a U.S. representative, was killed Sunday after she tried to attack a police officer at her home near Atlanta, police and the lawmakers said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJameela Barnette, 53, was armed with a knife and handgun when a police officer knocked on her door on Christmas morning as he responded to reports of an alarm inside, Cobb County Police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe opened the door and started assaulting the officer with the weapons, police said. The officer shot her, and Barnette died at the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnette was the same woman who sent threatening packages earlier this year to U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York and New York State Sen. Greg Ball, their offices said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnette was indicted in U.S. District Court in Atlanta in October on two counts of sending threatening packages. She pleaded not guilty in November and was released on $20,000 bond, according to court records.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the court also ordered Barnette to undergo a mental evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package sent to Ball contained a hoax weapon of mass destruction, said Ball spokeswoman Brittany Oat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indictment said it contained threatening messages and a vial of an unknown liquid, labeled \"Zyklon B,\" which Barnette indicated was a biological agent or toxin. The vial of liquid was in fact perfume oil, according to CNN affiliate WXXA-TV in Albany, the New York state capital, which spoke to Barnette in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package also contained a toy monkey wearing the Star of David, as shown in photos released by Ball's office.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnette told WXXA-TV she was a grandmother and a Muslim upset with Ball for holding hearings earlier this year on New York City's vulnerability to terrorism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He keeps messing with Muslims,\" Barnette told the station in April. \"Muslims have not been harassing anyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnette said she was not a threat and did not want people to think she was a dangerous person for sending the package.\n\n\n\n\n\nA representative for Barnette could not be reached Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in April, Barnette sent a bloody severed pig's foot and note to King's office on Capitol Hill, King said Monday. The package never reached King or his staffers because all mail to the U.S. Capitol is screened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe note was laced with anti-Semitic rants, including statements such as \"evil Jews will return this hoof to Palestine,\" a congressional source familiar with the situation said at the time. King is not Jewish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The woman, who called me a 'Muslim basher,' wrote 'kiss my black Muslim ass,'\" King said in a statement Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe this was all a result of the blind and false hysteria stirred up by opponents of the radicalization hearings I convened in March,\" King said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe officer who fired on Barnette on Sunday was treated for his injury and released at the scene, and is now on administrative leave pending investigation, according to the police department in suburbuan Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ashley Corum, Carol Cratty, Sara Pratley, and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- There are many reasons why Roz Savage is an extraordinary woman -- she has rowed single-handed across the Atlantic and is now tackling the Pacific, after all.\n\n\n\nLife changer: From successful career to ocean rower, Savage has been an inspiration for many.\n\n\n\nBut her response to everyday commuter ennui is perhaps of the most remarkable things about her. Back in 2000 a 33-year-old Roz was facing another dreary journey by train to the office.\n\n\n\nShe had a great job as a management consultant, money and a husband; but deep down she knew something was missing. So, instead of just burying her feelings, she wrote two obituaries of herself. In one she kept going with life as it was. In the other she took a jump into the unknown and did the things she'd always wanted to. From that moment on her life has never been the same.\n\n\n\n\"One-by-one, I shed the trappings of my old life,\" she writes on her web site.\n\n\n\n\"The job, the husband, the home, the little red sports car. I moved house with increasing regularity, wherever I could find cheap or preferably free accommodation.\n\n\n\n\"Little by little I began to realign my life, to put myself on track for the obituary I really wanted.\"\n\n\n\nEventually she settled on the challenge that would in many ways define her: rowing the Atlantic single handed.\n\n\n\nIt was, of course, incredibly hard, both physically and mentally. She had done some rowing while at the University of Oxford -- but the open ocean was a different challenge altogether. But she emerged a tougher, happier person on the other side, and is now deep into her new attempt to row the Pacific, a journey she hopes to use to raise awareness of environmental issues.\n\n\n\nThe courage she has found, both to take on the might of the open ocean and give up safe, conventional notions of success to pursue her dreams has made Roz a hero to many people that hope to find inspiration in her life -- including a large number of CNN.com readers who have nominated her as a \"Green Inspiration\".\n\n\n\n\"I feel a little embarrassed about it -- that must be the British in me!\" she told CNN from the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n\"I certainly don't see myself as any kind of hero, just a human being trying to be the best human she can be. But at the same time I want to reach out to as many people as I can, because I wish I'd had more positive role models to show me how good life can be, and if I can inspire just a few people to change their lives for the better, I'll feel I've lived a very blessed life.\"\n\n\n\nRowing across the Pacific Ocean\n\n\n\nOn her journey she keeps the many people following her up to date with regular blog posts on her website.\n\n\n\nPosts range from the personal to the global, the reality of life on the open waves to plastic pollution, the North Pacific Garbage Patch, and how people could reduce the amount of waste they generate.\n\n\n\n\"I try to offer my life as an example of what can be done when a very ordinary person decides to do something out of the ordinary,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"I love my life, and want to show people how much fun it can be when you get out there and grab life by the horns. It would be very selfish of me to keep this fantastic discovery to myself!\n\n\n\n\"Every time I get a comment on my blog from someone who says they have changed their life as a result of reading about me and my adventures -- anything from composting their kitchen scraps to quitting their job to start out on an adventure of their own -- it gives me a huge warm glow of accomplishment. And it makes me feel even better when they tell me how much fun they are having doing it. Because that is what life is all about.\"\n\n\n\nBut adventure doesn't have to involve months alone in a rowing boat, with only sea birds, the sun and the wind for company.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is different, and will find their own way,\" she said. \"For me, at the time when I decided to row oceans, I felt the need for a dramatic contrast to the very conventional life I'd had before, and ocean rowing seemed to fit the bill. I do think that you learn things about yourself in extreme situations that you wouldn't learn in less testing circumstances.\n\n\n\n\"But the situation doesn't have to be physically extreme. Parenthood, starting a new business, moving to a new town or a new country -- these are all ways to put yourself in a challenging new environment where you have to throw away your old preconceptions about what is or is not possible, and try out new approaches.\"\n\n\n\nEver action has an effect\n\n\n\nRoz's advice for anyone stuck in a rut is don't be afraid to fail. If you know what you want to do, then don't be intimidated. Write a list of what you can do to achieve your goals. If there seems to be things on it you can't do yet, then Roz says it isn't detailed enough -- any task can be broken down into achievable steps.\n\n\n\n\"Everything is a learning experience if you allow it to be. I keep a journal -- on land and at sea -- and this really helps me to learn from my experiences,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAt the core of her mission in the Pacific is a belief that we can not only transform our own lives through our actions, but our relationship to the natural world around us as well.\n\n\n\n\"There has been so much bad news about environmental issues that I think some people feel overwhelmed,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"But there is something we can all do to make a difference -- and it all adds up.\n\n\n\n\"It's about more than just using a re-usable bag, or picking up a piece of trash from a beach. It's about an attitude and a way of thinking.\n\n\n\n\"Every action has effects beyond the action itself -- other people will see what you are doing and follow your example. It's the ripple effect. And if we all pull together, we can make a world of difference.\"\n\n\n\nFundamentally, her message is that life is for living and we learn as much from failure as success if we are open-minded and positive.\n\n\n\n\"My life now is so much more fulfilling and fun, and I'm incredibly glad I took that leap of faith. There is nothing special about me that made me able to do it. If I can do it, anybody can -- if they want to.\n\n\n\n\"Get out there, live life large, make the world a better place -- and have fun!\"\n\n\n\nSend us an email and tell us who you think deserves to be recognized as a Green Inspiration",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Michael Jackson collapsed at his rented mansion last month, the singer's arms were riddled with marks and their veins had collapsed -- both characteristics found in intravenous drug users, sources told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nA source says Michael Jackson had \"paper white skin. As white as a white T-shirt.\"\n\n\n\nThe revelations add to the speculation that prescription drugs played a part in Jackson's death on June 25. The exact cause is pending toxicology results that aren't due for at least another week.\n\n\n\nA source involved with the investigation into Jackson's death told CNN that Jackson had \"numerous track marks\" on his arms -- and that those marks \"could certainly be consistent with the regular IV use of a drug, like Diprivan.\"\n\n\n\nThe sources did not want to be identified because the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\n\nThe source said investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in the singer's $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, but he would not confirm whether Diprivan was among them.  Watch what sources say on condition of Jackson's body \u00bb\n\n\n\nHe also cautioned that it was too soon to say whether an intravenous drip of Diprivan caused the track marks. Some appeared fresh; others older, he said. The new ones could have resulted from the IVs that paramedics used when they tried to revive Jackson after he was found unconscious.\n\n\n\nAnother source with knowledge of the case said Jackson's veins were collapsed in both arms, suggesting frequent intravenous drug use.\n\n\n\nThe first source said Jackson's body was \"lily white from head to toe,\" perhaps the result of vitiligo -- a condition that causes the skin to lose melanin and produce slowly enlarging white patches.\n\n\n\nThe second source said Jackson had \"paper white skin. As white as a white T-shirt.\"\n\n\n\nThe singer also did not have any hair -- a lingering effect, possibly, of an accident in 1984 when Jackson suffered burns to his scalp while shooting a commercial for Pepsi.\n\n\n\nAlso, said the second source, Jackson was emaciated -- despite the vigor he's seen displaying in a taped rehearsal clip shot two nights before his death.\n\n\n\nThe drug Diprivan, known by its generic name Propofol, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a general anesthetic.\n\n\n\nLast week, a nutritionist -- Cherilyn Lee -- said Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects, because he had difficulty falling asleep.\n\n\n\nSources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would \"take him down\" at night and \"bring him back up\" during a world tour in the mid-'90s.\n\n\n\nThe California state attorney general's office is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in Jackson's death investigation. The office confirmed it is investigating some doctors who treated Jackson over the years.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is also looking into the role of drugs.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles police have interviewed Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They impounded Murray's car, saying it might contain evidence, possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything.\n\n\n\nThrough his lawyers, Murray has released several statements, saying he would not be commenting until the toxicology results from Jackson's autopsy are released.\n\n\n\nDr. Neil Ratner, the anesthesiologist who accompanied Jackson during the HIStory tour in the mid-'90s, also refused to comment, although he acknowledged Jackson suffered from a sleep disorder.\n\n\n\nCNN's Susan Chun contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Double world champion Sebastian Vettel suffered a disrupted second practice session ahead of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton setting the pace on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Bull driver Vettel was back at the track where he claimed the first of his two world championships 12 months ago -- the youngest driver to achieve the feat -- but the German spun out on the first corner of the Yas Marina Circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nVettel, who has won 11 of 17 races in 2011, recovered to rejoin practice with 10 minutes remaining, but finished in sixth position on a track where he has won for the past two years. He ended the day half a second behind Hamilton's leading time of one minute 39.586 secs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton, world champion in 2008 but only fifth overall after a disappointing season, led second-placed teammate Jenson Button ahead of Saturday's qualifying.\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest F1 standings after Indian GP\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I lost the car on the entrance to turn one,\" Vettel, who clinched the 2011 championship with third place in Japan last month, told the sport's official website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think I was too wide and too far on to the kerb, so I lost the rear and couldn't catch the car anymore. I was lucky to get out again at the end of P2; there wasn't much damage apart from the front wing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish racer Hamilton was pleased with his form and was confident ahead of this season's penultimate race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a really positive day for me,\" the 26-year-old said. \"The track just got better and better today, so I slowly chipped away at the set-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tires are behaving well -- at the last race I had degradation and didn't have the pace, so it feels much better this weekend. That's a real positive for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you come through a Friday without any problems, it definitely makes you feel confident for the rest of the weekend.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nButton, the 2009 world champion and running second this year, admitted to experimenting during his practice run on a track where passing has traditionally been difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was playing around with overtaking on my long run,\" the 31-year-old said. \"But I still reckon it'll be difficult to overtake people in the DRS zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I think it's going to be a bit of a struggle to make moves stick in the race -- which means it's going to be important to qualify up at the front. It's tricky around here, but we made some good progress here this afternoon and evening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrari's Fernando Alonso also slid off having spent a short period leading the field. The double world champion eventually came home third ahead of Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa.\n\n\n\n\n\nVettel's fellow Red Bull driver Mark Webber was fifth fastest, with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher seventh for Mercedes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2011 campaign will finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo on November 27.",

The bishop had been at the hospital for several days, she said.\n\n\n\nPaulk's death came after an \"extended and horrible battle with cancer,\" Paulk's nephew, Bishop Jim Swilley, wrote in a blog post.\n\n\n\nPaulk founded the Chapel Hill Harvester Church in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta. It quickly grew to become one of the first megachurches in the country. Paulk also had his own television show.\n\n\n\nBut his success as a preacher was overshadowed time and again by allegations of sexual impropriety.\n\n\n\nOne allegation ended in a civil suit that was settled out of court in 2003. The accuser said Paulk molested her when she was a child.\n\n\n\nA second woman claimed the bishop forced her into a 14-year affair. She filed, withdrew and refiled a suit.\n\n\n\nDennis Brewer, an attorney for Paulk, admitted to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Paulk had a brief adulterous relationship with the woman, but said she was the initiator.\n\n\n\nDuring a deposition in the case, the bishop said under oath the woman was the only one he slept with outside of marriage. But a court-ordered paternity test showed that he also fathered a child with his sister-in-law.\n\n\n\nOther allegations -- some true, some unfounded -- cost the church membership, as worshippers dwindled from 10,000 to about 1,000.\n\n\n\n\"As most of you know, my family has been walking through a very long nightmare season in connection with things concerning him,\" Swilley wrote in his blog post. \"Please pray for some much needed healing and closure for us all.\"",

Watch the recovering little girl meet the media \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of some 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts.\n\n\n\nLakshmi's extra limbs were part of a conjoined twin which stopped developing in the womb. It had a torso and limbs but no head, and was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis.\n\n\n\nDoctors said that without the surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence.\n\n\n\nThe surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.\n\n\n\nWhen Lakshmi was born into her poor, rural Indian family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed she was sacred. As news of her birth spread, locals queued for a blessing from the baby.\n\n\n\nHer parents, Shambhu and Poonam Tatma, named the girl after the Hindu goddess of wealth who has four arms. However, they were forced to keep her in hiding after they were approached by men offering money in exchange for putting their daughter in a circus.\n\n\n\nThe couple, who earn just $1 a day as casual laborers, wanted her to have the operation but were unable to pay for the rare procedure, which had never before been performed in India.\n\n\n\nAfter Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital's foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation.\n\n\n\nPlanning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.\n\n\n\nMany villagers, however, remained opposed to surgery and were planning to erect a temple to Lakshmi, whom they still revere as sacred.

In the incidents, unclassified U.S. military computer systems were broken into and information was taken, according to Pentagon officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the information taken was not classified, Pentagon officials said the worry is the Chinese hacking required many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for a computer network attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast summer, a cyber-attack on Department of Defense computer systems took down the e-mail capability of hundreds of staffers for weeks, but the Pentagon still will not comment on who initiated the attack. It is widely believed among the military to have been the Peoples Liberation Army.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina is also investing heavily in and fielding improved nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and antisatellite missiles, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States expressed its concern last year after China fired a missile at one of its old satellites and destroyed it, sending thousands of dangerous pieces of space debris into orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States conducted a similar strike last month on a broken U.S. spy satellite before it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. U.S. officials said the satellite was hit and broke into thousands of small pieces that burned up as they re-entered Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the Chinese navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers. The Chinese once had a small Navy. Now the United States is keeping an eye on the growing service amid concerns over Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concerns include \"China's near-term focus on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, including the possibility of U.S. intervention, which is an important driver of its modernization,\" the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Chinese have placed about 100 more short-range missiles on the shore opposite Taiwan in the past year, it says.\n\n\n\n\n\nPentagon officials worry the continued increase in Chinese military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between China and Taiwan in China's favor. The United States has said it would help defend Taiwan if China invaded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also says the Peoples Liberation Army is \"pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration, high-intensity conflicts along its periphery against high-tech adversaries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch an army, the report says, would have \"the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could, over time, offset traditional U.S. military advantages.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States says the lack of transparency by the Chinese on its spending poses \"risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,\" and that China has yet to explain to the international community the purpose of its military expansion, Pentagon officials said.

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Disturbed by the news that Moammar Gadhafi's wife and three children, along with some grandchildren, were able to flee over the Libyan border to Algeria in spite of a U.N. travel ban, the U.S. State Department nonetheless is taking a low-key approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are concerns that this isn't in keeping with the travel ban restrictions,\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday but, defending the administration's response, she said the United States is reviewing Algeria's explanation for why it let the family into the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nGadhafi's two sons who fled, Hannibal and Mohammed, along with his daughter, Aisha, are specifically named in the U.N. travel ban for \"closeness of association with (the) regime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We care, in terms of the fact that under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, the Gadhafi family was subject to a travel ban,\" Nuland said. \"So, they have now traveled. The government of Algeria has now sent a letter to the UN. We are reviewing that letter now in New York but, clearly, there has to be an international community decision and response in regard to the travel ban restrictions that (the resolution) imposes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Algerian representative to the U.N. said Monday that his government let the Gadhafis into the country on \"humanitarian grounds.\" Aisha Gadhafi gave birth to a daughter at the border.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria's Ambassador to the U.N., Mourad Benmehidi, told CNN, \"The wife of someone who has grievances with the international community is not necessarily subject to the same grievances.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N. resolution does allow exceptions to the travel ban resolution: \"Where the Committee determines on a case-by-case basis that such travel is justified on the grounds of humanitarian need, including religious obligation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt requires a state to inform the United Nations within 48 hours of any such decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have said that members of Gadhafi's family should be held accountable,\" the State Department's Nuland said, but added: \"...we need to review the Algerian government explanation, so does the (National Transitional Council), and we need to see where we go from there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria's decision to accept the family, however, has infuriated the rebel National Transitional Council. The council is demanding that Algerian authorities hand the family over to be tried by Libyan courts, calling Algeria's decision an \"act of aggression.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRebels who picked through Hannibal Gadhafi's seaside villa in Libya on Sunday introduced CNN's Dan Rivers to his family's badly scarred former nanny, who said she had been doused with boiling water by Hannibal's wife, model Aline Skaf, when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abuse was corroborated by another member of the household staff.",

The deal is part of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina voiced strong opposition to the deal when it was announced last week, with the state-run Xinhua news agency quoting China's vice foreign minister, Zhang Zhijun, as saying, \"The wrongdoing by the U.S. side will inevitably undermine bilateral relations as well as exchanges and cooperation in military and security areas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province. Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taiwan Strait separates the mainland from the island.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1979, the United States carried out its \"one China\" policy by switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. But the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the United States to help defend the island if needed. The United States also is Taiwan's main arms supplier.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeijing broke off military contacts with Washington last year to protest another arms sale to Taiwan. The sale included more than $6 billion in Patriot missiles, Black Hawk helicopters and communications equipment, which Taiwan said it needed for self-defense.",

Watch some tough love for Rihanna \u00bb\n\n\n\nBrown is due back in court on April 6 for his formal arraignment. If he is convicted, he could face as much as four years and eight months in prison, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said.\n\n\n\nThe case has been moved to L.A. County Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg who signed the search warrant in the case.\n\n\n\nBrown's attorney, Mark Geragos, requested a prearraignment hearing which is scheduled for March 23 in Schnegg's chambers. Brown is not required to be at the hearing. iReport.com: Chris Brown fans: Share your reaction\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday he withdrew his nominations for two Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, a spokesman said. Brown, 19, had been nominated for \"Favorite Song\" and \"Favorite Male Singer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding the incident last month has shifted the focus from the music to whether he should be allowed to be among those nominated,\" the spokesman said in a written statement. \"While Chris would like to speak to his fans directly about this and other issues, pending legal proceedings preclude his doing so at this time.

We cannot expect to get near the ship in this condition,\" defense ministry spokesman Won Tae-jae told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary officials say an explosion tore a hole in the rear of the ship, but the cause of the blast is not known.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korean President Lee Myung-bak has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion, and the country's defense minister, Kim Tae-young, has raised the possibility that one of the many North Korean sea mines placed during the 1950-53 Korean War could have triggered the blast.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the military was \"trying its best\" to find survivors and that the cause of the incident will be made public \"at the soonest possible time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRescuers find rear section of ship where sailors could be trapped\n\n\n\n\n\nThe navy plans to salvage the vessel, which was carrying missiles and torpedoes, to determine what caused the incident, Yonhap reported. Kim said work to hoist the ship above water could start next week and he said the government is mulling the formation of a fact-finding group to look into the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will explain anything to answer questions and address rumors concerning the incident,\" Kim said. \"We have nothing to hide and no reason to hide. So many lives are involved in this case.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday evening was the end of a 69-hour window during which rescuers believed the sailors could survive. Divers have knocked on the hulls of different parts of the ship with hammers, but raised no response.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaengyeong Island, the Seoul-administered island near the scene of the accident, is a flash point maritime border area between the Koreas. Given Baengyeong Island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement had been feared, but South Korean officials have continued to play down that scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea's official media has yet to mention the incident, according to Yonhap, but accused the United States and South Korea of conducting a maritime drill for the purpose of invading North Korea.",

  "context": "LONDON (CNN) -- Iran offered to stop attacking coalition troops in Iraq nearly four years ago in an attempt to get the West to accept Tehran's nuclear program, a British diplomat told the BBC in an interview aired Saturday.\n\n\n\nJohn Sawers, British ambassador to the U.N., told BBC of Iran approaching Western nations with offer.\n\n\n\n\"The Iranians wanted to be able to strike a deal whereby they stopped killing our forces in Iraq in return for them being allowed to carry on with their nuclear program -- 'We stop killing you in Iraq, stop undermining the political process there, you allow us to carry on with our nuclear program without let or hindrance,\" said John Sawers, now the British ambassador to the United Nations, in the documentary, \"Iran and the West: Nuclear Confrontation.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States and other Western nations believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, but Iran says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy. Iran also has been accused of sponsoring terrorists and supplying weapons to Iraqi insurgents. The latter prompted a warning from the United States that such behavior by Tehran \"would be regarded by us as enemy action,\" Philip Zelikow, a State Department counselor, told the BBC.\n\n\n\nThen, Iran began shopping its offer around Europe, Sawers said.\n\n\n\nSawers, Britain's political director at the time, reveals the behind-the-scene talks from 2005 -- when roadside bombing against British and American soldiers in Iraq peaked -- were held with British, French and German diplomats at hotels in London, Paris and Berlin.\n\n\n\n\"And then we'd compare notes among the three of us,\" Sawers told the BBC.\n\n\n\nThe British government dismissed the offer and Iran's nuclear enrichment program restarted once again, the BBC reports\n\n\n\nIran has denied offering any such deal and reiterated its position Saturday.\n\n\n\n\"Iran's high officials have repeatedly stated that Iran has not had any part in attacks against American and British forces, and there is no evidence to support these baseless accusations,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency.\n\n\n\nInterviews with top brass from former President Bush's administration and British envoys indicate that Iran and the West had neared agreements several times in the past few years, but never reached success.\n\n\n\nNick Burns, who was in charge of the Bush administration's State Department policy with Iran, said taking a tough approach with Iran didn't seem effective.\n\n\n\n\"We had advocated regime change,\" Burns told the BBC. \"We had a very threatening posture towards Iran for a number of years. It didn't produce any movement whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nThe documentary aired a day after the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating that Iranian scientists have reached \"nuclear weapons breakout capability.\" The report analyzed the finding of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\n\n\nHowever, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium (HEU) in order to be weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's relationship with the West continues to be strained, though both sides have indicated interest in holding direct talks.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama, in his first prime-time news conference held earlier this month, said the United States is looking for opportunities for \"face-to-face\" talks with Iran after an absence of diplomatic ties for nearly three decades.\n\n\n\n\"There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAnd Iran's powerful parliament speaker and former nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, has called the Obama administration \"an exceptional opportunity for Americans.\"",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A former police officer tearfully apologized Monday for his role in an elderly Atlanta woman's shooting death during a botched drug raid, and another told a judge he prays daily for the victim.   \"I used to think I was a good person,\" ex-cop Gregg Junnier said before breaking down on the witness stand during a sentencing hearing in a federal courtroom in Atlanta, CNN affiliate WXIA reported.\n\n\n\nJunnier and two other ex-officers, Arthur Tesler and Jason Smith, face prison in connection with the November 2006 drug raid that left 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston dead in a hail of gunfire.\n\n\n\nInvestigators later determined the raid was based on falsified paperwork stating that illegal drugs were present in the home. The killing prompted a major overhaul of the Atlanta police drug unit.\n\n\n\nSmith, like Junnier, apologized during Monday's sentencing hearing. The proceedings were expected to resume Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\"I pray daily for Ms. Johnston. I also pray other officers in Atlanta will have the moral fortitude I didn't have,\" Smith testified Monday, according to WXIA.\n\n\n\nSmith, Junnier and Tesler pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. Smith and Junnier also pleaded guilty to state charges of voluntary manslaughter and making false statements, and Smith admitted to planting bags of marijuana in Johnston's house after her death.\n\n\n\nTesler was convicted on one state count of making false statements for filling out an affidavit stating that an informant had purchased crack cocaine at Johnston's home in a crime-plagued neighborhood near downtown Atlanta. The informant denied having been to Johnston's home, leading to investigations by local authorities and the FBI, and the breakup and reorganization of the Atlanta police narcotics unit.\n\n\n\nPolice said Johnston fired at them with an old pistol during the raid, and they shot back in self-defense. Johnston's one shot went through her front door and over the officers' heads; they responded with 39 shots, hitting Johnston five times.\n\n\n\n\"Her death was the foreseeable culmination of a long-standing conspiracy in which the officers violated their oaths of office,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon-Peter Kelly said, according to CNN affiliate WSB. The officers \"regularly swore falsely\" to get warrants and make cases, he said.\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors said officers cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses, often while on duty and for cash payments.\n\n\n\nJohnston's family was not in court Monday. But U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes heard a letter from Johnston's niece during the hearing, and family spokesman Markel Hutchins told WXIA he hopes an FBI report of the case can be used to prompt additional charges at the local level.\n\n\n\n\"The real culprit in this is the culture within the Atlanta Police Department and the higher-ups that laid the foundation. Why aren't they being held accountable?\" Hutchins asked.\n\n\n\nThe probe also led to guilty pleas by the police sergeant in charge of the narcotics unit and another officer who admitted to extortion, federal prosecutors said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Thursday brings one of the biggest slates of Hollywood entertainment to open on Christmas Day in many years.\n\nTom Cruise stars as would-be Hitler assassin Col. Claus von Stauffenberg in the World War II drama \"Valkyrie.\"\n\nStars such as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler are featured in a slew of big-budget movies hoping to lure people into theaters this holiday season.\n\nHere are the top five movies opening Thursday:\n\n1. \"Valkyrie\" -- Tom Cruise stars in the true story of a German military officer who conspires to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Cruise plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, a proud military man who realizes that Hitler must be stopped before Germany and Europe collapse under Nazi rule.\n\nJoining Cruise are three-time Oscar nominee Kenneth Branagh as Maj. Gen. Henning von Tresckow and twice-nominated actor Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm. United Artists is releasing the film.\n\n2. \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" -- Brad Pitt stars in this fantasy drama about a man who ages backward. He's born in his 80s and then gets younger as the years pass. \"Button\" is based on the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and runs two hours and 47 minutes.\n\nThe cast includes Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett, who is creating Oscar buzz this year as well for her portrayal of Daisy in \"Button.\" The film, released by Paramount Pictures, already has won several film critics' awards.\n\n3. \"Marley & Me\" -- Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston learn life lessons from an out-of-control canine they decide to adopt. This comedy-drama is adapted from the best-selling novel by John Grogan.\n\nSome audiences expecting a feel-good comedy such as \"Turner & Hooch\" or \"Beethoven\" may be surprised by this painfully realistic portrayal that could leave audiences teary-eyed at the end. The supporting cast includes Alan Arkin and Kathleen Turner. The PG-rated film gets a 20th Century Fox release.\n\n4. \"Bedtime Stories\" -- Funny guy Adam Sandler shoots for the family crowd with this fantasy comedy about a hotel handyman who tells his niece and nephew a bedtime story, only to find out that his fantasy stylings are coming true.\n\nSandler's film, which also stars Guy Pearce, Courteney Cox and Keri Russell, is getting mixed reviews so far. It's rated PG for mild rude humor and mild language.\n\n5. \"The Spirit\" -- Based on a graphic novel about a masked crusader, \"The Spirit\" will cater to the so-called fanboys who hope the film's PG-13 rating will push the envelope on violence and other cool stuff. iReport.com: Will you see any of the new movies on tap during the holidays?\n\nGabriel Macht plays Denny Colt, aka The Spirit, in this story of a man who fakes his death so he can fight a coldblooded killer known as the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson). Eva Mendes is along for the ride, which could be a plus for the film's desired demographic of young men 13 to 21. Lionsgate is distributing.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Gregg Keesling chooses his words carefully when he talks about the death of his son, Spc. Chancellor Keesling.\n\n\n\nAs far as he's concerned, the soldier didn't \"take his own life\" or \"commit suicide.\"\n\n\n\nHis son \"died by suicide,\" Keesling insists -- and he has his reasons why.\n\n\n\nWhen 25-year old Chancellor Keesling shot himself in Iraq on June 19, his family received much support from the military and local officials. Gregg Keesling's son was given the honor afforded to a fallen service member.\n\n\n\nThe Keesling family went to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to watch as his body was flown back to Indiana six days later. At his burial, seven rifles fired three times each, in true military tradition.\n\n\n\nLater, the soldier's aunt created a memorial wall in the family's Indianapolis living room. On the wall hangs Spc. Keesling's uniform, the U.S. flag that was handed to his mother, Jannett, after the service and the Indianapolis flag that flew over the state Capitol in his honor.\n\n\n\nYet there's an empty spot on the wall for an honor that never arrived: a letter from the president.\n\n\n\nGregg Keesling wanted to know why, especially after hearing President Obama talk about how he struggled to write letters to the families of each and every soldier killed in the war.\n\n\n\nAfter pressing for an answer, the family found out the truth: There would be no condolence letter.\n\n\n\nIt's a matter of policy dating to the Clinton era, according to the White House. The commander in chief sends such letters to the families of troops who have died in combat, but not if they committed suicide, Gregg was told.\n\n\n\nThe policy felt wrong to Gregg and Jannett Keesling. Their son was a hero, and his country should be proud of him, they said. So Gregg Keesling wrote to Obama and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr., imploring them to rethink the policy.\n\n\n\n\"The recognition of the president could have profound impact on the family of the suicide victim,\" Keesling wrote in August.\n\n\n\nRead the letters to President Obama\n\n\n\n\"The lack of acknowledgment and condolences from the President, who our family admires greatly, leaves us with an emotional vacuum and a feeling that we his family have somehow [made] less of a sacrifice,\" he wrote in another letter to Casey.\n\n\n\nA White House spokesman said the administration is reviewing the \"inherited\" policy.\n\n\n\n\"The President's thoughts and prayers are with every military family who has lost a loved one in service to our country. As Commander-in-Chief, he has worked with Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen to address the mental health needs of our service members,\" spokesman Tommy Vietor wrote in an e-mail.\n\n\n\nSpc. Keesling completed two tours of duty in Iraq. When he enlisted in 2003, the family struggled with his decision. But the young soldier was convinced that he made the right decision, telling his family, \"We must have a military, and somebody's got to be in it.\"\n\n\n\nBefore he deployed 2005, he was anxious but excited, his mother remembered.\n\n\n\nHowever, toward the end of his deployment, the stress of a failing marriage and the shock of war \"began to wear on him terribly,\" Gregg Keesling said.\n\n\n\nIn anger, he threw his wedding ring into the Tigris River, his parents said. He was put under suicide watch, and his ammunition was taken away for several days.\n\n\n\nAt home, though, he was \"back to his old self,\" his father said, adding that his son found a job at FedEx and a new girlfriend.\n\n\n\nHe was treated at the Veterans Affairs clinic for a shoulder injury and burn he suffered during his deployment. His parents assumed he was being treated for everything he needed.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, he received new deployment orders . His family suggested that he move to his mother's native Jamaica to avoid service, but the soldier insisted that it was his obligation to see it through, his parents said.\n\n\n\nWhen Keesling deployed again, this time as a reservist, he wasn't with his original comrades. Instead, he and 10 other Indiana reserves shipped off with a 300-member unit from Tennessee, with just two months of training together.\n\n\n\nHis mental health records were not passed on either, leaving Spc. Keesling to share his past problems with his unit if he so chose. He never did.\n\n\n\n\"I understand that, but it is a very big burden to put on a soldier to self-identify,\" Gregg Keesling said.\n\n\n\nIn e-mails to his family, Spc. Keesling wrote about how distant he felt from his new brothers in arms.\n\n\n\n\"I hate going to war with people I don't know,\" he said to his father.\n\n\n\nGregg Keesling said his son struggled with members of his unit who joked about troops who committed suicide, oblivious to his struggles.\n\n\n\nIt became too much to bear.\n\n\n\nAfter a long-distance fight with his girlfriend, the soldier said in an e-mail that he wanted to shoot himself.\n\n\n\nAfter several phone calls, Spc. Keesling told his mother that he would talk to the Army chaplain.\n\n\n\nHe never did. Instead, 12 hours after that e-mail, he went into a latrine and shot himself.\n\n\n\nThe family believes that his suicide was brought on by the stress of war and the distance from loved ones. To them, it is death by injury like any other incident.\n\n\n\n\"He died by suicide,\" Gregg said. \"He just had an injury that we just did not recognize.\"\n\n\n\nAnd that's why they want a letter from the president.\n\n\n\n\"We don't want to force the president to write a letter of condolence. We hope he would want to,\" Gregg said. \"We hope the president of the United States would want to show the appreciation to a family like ours for the sacrifice we made in allowing our son to become a soldier and defend his country.\"",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- This year, the Oscars are on Hugh Jackman's shoulders.\n\nHugh Jackman plans to offer viewers \"a good time\" at the Oscars. He hosts the big show Sunday night.\n\nThe Australian actor, who earned rave reviews for his hosting of the Tonys, now has the Academy Awards to contend with.\n\nIt's a job that's put Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Whoopi Goldberg and David Letterman on the firing line, with only Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson emerging more or less unscathed in the last couple of decades.\n\nBut with typical verve -- after all, this is the guy who won a Tony for playing song-and-dance man Peter Allen in \"The Boy from Oz\" -- Jackman cracks jokes about the task, telling ABC that one of his distinctions is that he's the \"tallest\" Oscar host in recent years.\n\nTo CNN's Brooke Anderson, he was equally at ease. \"Ultimately, the way I see it is if I'm not going to have a good time, then how can anyone else have a good time,\" he said.  Watch Hugh Jackman talk about doing it the Australian way \u00bb\n\nEven if he's not having a good time, you may not want to get in his way. After all, this is the guy who's played the fearsome, sharp-clawed Wolverine in the \"X-Men\" movies and gets a solo turn as the superhero in the forthcoming \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\"\n\nJackman talked with Anderson about musical numbers, Heath Ledger and performing \"drunk and nude.\" The following is an edited version of the interview.\n\nCNN: Are you feeling any nerves, or is it just pure excitement at this point?\n\nHugh Jackman: It's more, it is more excitement. I'm not impervious ... there has been moments in my life where I've been nervous going on stage, that's for sure, and I know I'll have a butterfly or two, cause yeah, you wanna have a couple. But ultimately, the way I see it is if I'm not going to have a good time, then how can anyone else have a good time. You know, you're the host -- it's not really about you. Ultimately, it's your job to set the tone.  Watch Hollywood prepare for the Oscars \u00bb\n\nCNN: And the butterflies give you a little bit of adrenaline, I would expect.\n\nJackman: Yeah, and I'll be drinking from about 9 a.m., so that's why I'm impervious.\n\nCNN: Now you're a triple threat [a dancer, actor and singer]. I need confirmation on a couple of things. Are you doing a musical number with Beyonce?\n\nJackman: Oh, that's a good question. Look, I'm old school, I don't want to give too much away. But I didn't fully deny it, did I? There's going to be some surprises, that's for sure.\n\nCNN: Stars of \"High School Musical\" as well?\n\nJackman: OK, I'll give you that. Yes, they're going to be up on stage.\n\nCNN: This is really a reinvention of the Oscars this year. The ratings have been low. Traditionally a comedian hosts the show. How do you feel about being part of the reinvention this year?\n\nJackman: I'm thrilled and honored, and that's honestly how I feel. I don't worry about the ratings or anything like that. I'm really excited by what is planned for the night, and I can tell you it's different. It really is different. I mean having someone as tall as me is a big change. ... It's really not going to be funny at all.\n\nNo, but there's so many things I love about what they're doing with the show. Forget ratings, you should always reinvent -- you should always be doing something different. What this night is going to be about is spontaneity. We're going to set an atmosphere that will allow things to happen that you won't expect.\n\nAnd the other thing that I and the creators wanted to keep at the top and forefront of the night is that it should only happen on that night -- whatever happens, it could only happen on Oscar night, and only this year will it happen. So there's going to be some things in there where you're like, \"Oh!\"\n\nCNN:  How daring is it going to be? Will there be YouTube moments where people will be talking about the Oscars this year after it happens?\n\nJackman: One of my favorite moments at the Oscars was when the streaker came across David Niven. And we're upping it a level and we're just going to do most of the show naked. Um, well, there hopefully will be YouTube moments.\n\nCNN: \"The sexiest man alive\" [is] going to be up there nude?\n\nJackman: Drunk and nude, yes. So that's our new fresh approach. It's the Australian way.\n\nCNN: Are you going to work that \"sexiest man alive\" title into the show?\n\nJackman: There's a few jokes floating around. Of course I will be about 8 feet away from two-time sexiest man alive Brad Pitt, so yes, there's great temptation to use something there.\n\nCNN: And political jokes -- will there be many of them that you will work into the act?\n\nJackman: Hmm ... there may be some, but it won't be top-heavy.\n\nCNN: OK, so lots of surprises. You've got experience with award shows, how is this different than hosting the Tonys?\n\nJackman: The Tony Awards is watched by more people in the theater than at home on television. So, the Oscars, it's slightly different, there's about a thousand here [in the theater] and a billion out there.\n\nBut really, if I hadn't done the Tony Awards, I'd be a hell of a lot more nervous. I mean I'm trained as an actor, that's what I do, it's not like I'm trained to be a host. But having done that, the thing that I think surprised me more than anything was how much fun I had because anything can happen. You're always amongst people who are, they're pros. There's people out there, and if you played with them, they'll generally play back, and that's the thing I like about it.\n\nCNN: Heath Ledger was a fellow Australian. Do you think [it will] be a fitting tribute for him to posthumously win an Oscar?\n\nJackman: You know of course, I can't help [but] feel sentimentally for him to be recognized. I think everyone recognizes his talent, his contributions. He was a friend of mine -- I knew him -- so I would love him to get that kind of public recognition. His family will be there; I can't help but feel that will be great. So that's the only category that I will give my preferences.\n\nI have a few others. I've had a few little sly bets going. I've got to talk to all those people backstage: Hey, I thought you should have won!\n\nCNN: How do you balance your home life with your busy schedule?\n\nJackman: You abandon your family at this point in time. Literally, they're in New York. People have said, \"Oh, is the family coming out?\" and I've said [to my family] don't bother coming -- I leave at about 7 in the morning and I get home at about 11 at night, so right now it's Skype. God bless Skype.\n\nCNN: The kids are understanding?\n\nJackman: Yeah, they're cool. My son, who's named Oscar by the way, he goes, \"You know what the headline should be? 'Oscar's dad hosts the Oscars.' \" And I was like, that's pretty good. Yeah, he'll stay up and watch it. iReport.com: Who do you think will win at the Oscars?",

  "context": "Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- The body of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in Russia over the weekend, returned to tributes in his homeland Sunday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoldiers in perfect step carried the casket from the plane that transported onto the tarmac, where mourners were waiting. Catholic priests recited prayers at the military airport before Kaczynski's daughter and twin brother, followed by others, took turns kneeling before the flag-draped casket.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople lined up along the streets along where Kaczynski's body would pass on its way to the presidential palace.\n\n\n\n\n\nTens of thousands of Poles across the country observed a two-minute-long moment of silence to remember their president and 95 others killed in the plane crash.\n\n\n\n\n\niReport: Mourners' candles a 'spot of light'\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, investigators said they found the aircraft's flight data recorders in good condition and began deciphering them Sunday, the independent Russian Interfax news agency reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents flocked to central Warsaw, the site of the presidential palace, to mourn Kaczynski. They left wreaths and lit candles. By Sunday, the numbers grew to about 100,000 by some estimates. Many cried openly. Others stared blankly at the sky.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the country begins a week-long period of mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plane carrying Kaczynski crashed Saturday morning while trying to land at an airport near Smolensk in Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiography: Lech Kaczynski\n\n\n\n\n\nKaczynski's wife and several top military officials were also killed in the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nParliament Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski took over as acting president and declared it \"a time for national mourning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKaczynski, 60, had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia for the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20,000 Poles, including soldiers and civilians, were executed there during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Polish military plane carrying Kaczynski originated in Warsaw, the Polish Defense Ministry said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was just a few miles east of Katyn when it crashed around 10:50 a.m. (2:50 a.m. ET) on the outskirts of the town of Pechorsk, close to Smolensk, the Investigation Committee of the Russian prosecutor's office said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld leaders pay tribute to Kaczynski\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Saturday night, Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw, visited the site of the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs others around him prayed, he silently knelt down on pile of rubble where mourners had propped up flowers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities do not yet know what caused the crash. Russia has emphasized that there is no evidence it was responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Investigation Committee said the plane, a Tupolev-154, was trying to land in heavy fog. A Russian military official said that air traffic control in Smolensk had tried to divert the plane to another airport because of inclement weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The air traffic control officer gave several orders to divert but the plane continued with its descent,\" said Alexander Aleshin, a top Russian air force official. \"Unfortunately, this ended in tragedy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Putin to head an inquiry commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported that the crash was not caused by technical problems, citing investigation officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plane carrying Kaczynski was refurbished and repaired last year, according to Alexei Gusev, general director of Aviakor Factory, the company that performed the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaking openly, we believe that this tragedy could not have been caused by equipment failure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaczynski had been president since December 2005, after he defeated rival Donald Tusk in the second round of voting.\n\n\n\n\n\nElections must now be held within 60 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Polish officials killed in the crash include Aleksander Szczyglo, the head of the National Security Office; Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the deputy parliament speaker; Andrzej Kremer, the deputy foreign minister; and Gen. Franciszek Gagor, the army chief of staff, according to Kaczynski's Law and Justice Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does crash mean for Polish politics?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party also said that Slawomir Skrzypek, head of the National Bank of Poland, was killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPutin spoke Saturday at the crash site, where charred pieces of the airplane were strewn through a wooded area. Some pieces, including one of the wheel wells, were upside down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As our first priority, we must establish the causes of this tragedy,\" he said. \"As a second priority, we must do everything in our power to assist the families and relatives of the deceased.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Warsaw, Poland, and Nic Robertson in Smolensk, Russia, contributed to this report.",

  "context": "HIMACHAL PRADESH, India (CNN) -- Amar and Kundan Singh Pundir are brothers. Younger brother Amar breaks rocks in a mine for a living. Kundan farms their small piece of inherited land. They live in a beautiful but remote hillside village in the clouds of Himachal Pradesh, India.\n\n\n\nKundar Singh Pundir, left, and his brother Amar, right, share Indira Devi, centre, as their wife.\n\n\n\nBoth aged in their forties, the two brothers have lived together nearly their whole lives. They are poor and share just about everything: Their home, their work and a wife.\n\n\n\n\"See we have a tradition from the beginning to have a family of five to 10 people. Two brothers and one wife.\" Kundan says.\n\n\n\nThey practice what is known as fraternal polyandry -- where the brothers of one family marry the same woman. Why? Tradition and economics.\n\n\n\nLife is hard here. The village is precariously perched on the side of a very steep hill about 6,000ft up. Most of the villagers survive off tiny plots of cropland.\n\n\n\nIn this difficult terrain there isn't enough land to go around. So, instead of finding separate wives and splitting up their inherited property, the brothers marry the same woman and keep their land together.\n\n\n\nWife Indira Devi says life with two husbands isn't easy.\n\n\n\n\"We fight a lot.\"\n\n\n\nBut like any married couple they fight mostly over mundane stuff, except there are three spouses instead of two.\n\n\n\n\"Usually it's about chores, why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?\" she says.  Watch Sara Sidner's interview with the brothers \u00bb\n\n\n\nOne thing they agreed on was the need to have children; They have three. So how does a married trio deal with sex?\n\n\n\n\"We make shifts, change shifts and sleep on alternate days. We have to make shifts otherwise it won't work,\" Kundan says.\n\n\n\n\"To run our families we have to do this, overcome the hurdles as well and then we have to control our hearts from feeling too much,\" Amar adds.\n\n\n\nTo outsiders their arrangement may seem odd, but in the village of about 200 it is the norm.\n\n\n\nTypically the marriages are arranged and women have two husbands. But some wives have three or four depending on how many brothers there are in a family.\n\n\n\nPolyandry is illegal in India but socially acceptable here. No one from the government seems to bother the villagers about the law.\n\n\n\n\"It's been going on for ages. My sister in law has two husbands, my mother in law also has two husbands,\" Indira says.\n\n\n\nAnd as to the question of which husband is the biological father of the children -- the Pundir's don't know and don't care.\n\n\n\n\"For me everyone is the same, my mother and my fathers are the same. My mother and my fathers are like God to me,\" 17-year old daughter Sunita Singh Pundir says.\n\n\n\nEven as modern society arrives in this ancient village through satellite dishes and mobile phones, the Pundirs say they want their age-old tradition to continue with their children.\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely,\" eldest son Sohna says.\n\n\n\nHe and his younger brother have already discussed it and will marry the same woman.\n\n\n\nDaughter Sunita isn't so sure.\n\n\n\n\"I would like one husband,\" she says.\n\n\n\nBut when asked if she will marry for love or tradition, Sunita's answer makes it clear the tradition of marrying more than one man will continue with the next generation.\n\n\n\n\"I will never leave our tradition even if I have to forgo love. I will never spoil my parents' reputation and my brothers.'\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A Texas inmate in a wheelchair, who escaped on foot from two armed guards as he was being transferred between prisons, is now on the U.S. Marshals' list of the 15 most-wanted fugitives.\n\n\n\n\n\nArcade Comeaux Jr., 49, \"produced a weapon and fired upon two correctional officers, took them hostage and forced them to drive to Baytown, Texas,\" the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe then put the officers in the back of the van and took their weapons and one of their uniforms, the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nComeaux was serving three life sentences for aggravated sexual assault and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He escaped Monday during transport from Huntsville, Texas, to Stiles, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 6-foot, 200-pound man was shackled and in a wheelchair, \"which he had claimed was needed for mobility,\" Michelle Lyons, director of public information for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 45 minutes into the trip, as they were driving through Conroe, 40 minutes north of Houston, the prisoner pulled out a pistol and ordered the guards to drive south to Baytown, east of Houston.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe fired once, but hit no one during the escape about 9 a.m., officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement officers found the unharmed officers an hour later.\n\n\n\n\n\nComeaux was being transferred so he could be near John Sealy Hospital in Galveston for treatment of the supposed paralysis he had suffered during a reported stroke, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least $16,000 in reward money has been offered for information leading to Comeaux's rearrest and a task force of more than 100 investigators is searching for him, focusing on the Houston area, where he grew up and has family.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis escape has led the man who oversees Texas' criminal justice system to call for a shakeup of the prison system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just think enough's enough,\" said Sen. John Whitmire, the Texas Democrat from Houston who is chairman of the state Senate's Criminal Justice Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need a complete shakeup of the leadership of our prison system and/or an outside review by third parties,\" he told CNN by phone Wednesday. \"We just can't have security breaches of this nature.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitmire said the guards had failed to pat down Comeaux while he was in his wheelchair and before they began the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sure enough, he has a firearm,\" he said. \"The question is, are there others (in the prison system)? I think you have to assume that there are until you find out differently.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far this year, more than 900 cell phones have been confiscated from the 112 locations that house the state's 158,000 prisoners. \"It's pretty rampant,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want the director to come forward and tell us what it's going to take\" to solve the problem, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Moriarty, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said such lapses are highly unusual in the state's penal system. \"We have no open gun investigations other than this one,\" he said. \"The last one was several years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice Executive Director Brad Livingston, who has been in the job since 2005, did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.",

  "context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- Over the last decade, Steven Soderbergh has taken the \"one for them, one for me\" concept of film-director politics to an almost comically programmatic extreme.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenicio Del Toro plays Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in Steven Soderbergh's biopic.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically, he makes big-budget crowd-pleasers like the \"Ocean's\" films, stuffed with movie stars and candied gimcrack fun, and between them he makes whatever oddball labor-of-love doodle (the enticing \"Bubble,\" the dreadful \"Solaris\") enters his head.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's disorienting about \"Che,\" his two-part, four-hour-and-17-minute, studiously eccentric drama about the revolutionary life and times of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, is that it's almost a knowing brainteaser on Soderbergh's part to force you to figure out which category the film belongs to.\n\n\n\n\n\nChe cost a reported $65 million to make, it's full of exacting panoramas of strategy and combat set in the mountainous jungles of Cuba and Bolivia, and its hero is a figure who -- 41 years after his violent death -- remains so loved, hated, and mythologized that he fits into an epic drama timed for awards season as perfectly as Gandhi or Ray Charles ever did. Following a one-week Oscar-qualifying run, \"Che\" is now rolling out to major American cities, where it is likely to draw generations of filmgoers who've either worn Che on their T-shirts or have the honest curiosity to wonder: Who was this man before he became a Warhol-worthy icon of radical chic?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \"Che,\" Soderbergh stokes that curiosity, feeds it, and frustrates it, all at the same time. He's made a film that embraces the romance of revolution only to shake it off, leaving very little in its place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first half of \"Che\" is a genuine achievement. It picks up Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) in 1955, when he was a clean-cut Argentine physician who dreamed of uniting Latin America through armed struggle. At a dinner party in Mexico City, he meets Fidel Castro -- played, with perfect domineering gesticulations, by Demian Bichir -- and the movie follows these two into the Cuban countryside, where they assemble the nuts and bolts of a revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoderbergh exhibits a tinkerer's fascination with how it all worked, embedding each scene with a docu-nugget of information. We see Che taming his asthmatic coughing fits or reading books between battles, and learn how a battalion of rebels could defeat a platoon three times its size (with surprise, daring, and Molotov cocktails).\n\n\n\n\n\nChe is by turns scholar, guidance counselor, drill sergeant, and comandante, and Del Toro makes him a warrior-saint who learns, against his will, to cultivate a gruff bruiser facade. He yearns to be a \"true revolutionary, the highest level of humanity,\" and it's no insult to the film to say that Soderbergh and Del Toro succeed in portraying Che as a kind of T-shirt in three dimensions, a Guerrilla for All Seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's when things get strange, if not monumentally perverse. At the end of Part I -- the victory of the Cuban rebels -- my appetite was whetted to learn even more about Che, in particular how his humane ideals were tested, and compromised, by the Castro regime as it edged toward dictatorship. Instead, Part II leaps forward to 1966-67, when Che led the revolutionary war in Bolivia, and here's the thing: It turns out to be the same damn movie. Only in this dispirited rerun, the revolution doesn't take.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rebels, all squabbling ego, can barely summon the will to sacrifice and die, and the peasants have little belief that this ragtag crew is bringing a better world. Even with the U.S. poking its nose into the region, the Soviet Union won't back an insurrection.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoderbergh has built \"Che\" conceptually, as two giant panels of war, and his message is about the doomed destiny of Marxism. Che, like Marx, believed that the rise of the proletariat was inevitable -- the unstoppable tide of history -- but as the movie reveals, he was wrong. Che didn't ride a wave of history; instead, it crashed down on him. By remaining the same, he becomes, in Part II, a distant and deluded figure whose dream evaporates around him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs political theater, \"Che\" moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly. Che doesn't grow richer, deeper, or reveal any contradictions; he just gets more abstract -- a symbol of idealism too pure for this world. Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nEW Grades: Part I: B+, Part II: C\n\n\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was against the terms of the Russia/Georgia cease-fire, brokered by France's President Nicolas Sarkozy. It was directly in contravention of the request not to do it from President George W. Bush of the United States. But Russia's President Dimitri Medvedev has gone and done it anyway. He has made Russia the first country to recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\n\n\nRussian President Dmitri Medvedev says it has recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\n\n\nSo does that, as some of the more fevered commentators are suggesting, amount to a new Cold War? It certainly ratchets up the East-West tension still further. It breaks the terms of a cease-fire which insisted Georgia's territorial integrity should be respected. Russia's announcement that it will station troops in the two territories to ensure their \"security\", a word others might spell as \"subservience\", is a direct provocation.\n\n\n\nIt is, says Georgia, an illegal \"annexation\". Other European nations have hastened to condemn it as an unacceptable rewriting of borders by force. What do you think of Russian recognition?\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, currently in the Middle East, points out that it is in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions that the Russians have accepted. Sarkozy has called a meeting of EU leaders for Monday to look at Georgia and at future relations with Russia.\n\n\n\nBut before we start talking about a new Cold War -- and Western leaders from Bush down are being careful not to do so-- we should examine the context.\n\n\n\nAfter the military action initiated by Georgia early in August, there never was a chance that South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have in effect been independent since the early 1990s, would return to control by Tblisi. Applying a blowtorch isn't necessarily the best way of settling what had become known as \"frozen conflicts\". Russia has long been in a position to bully and has now been given the excuse to do so.\n\n\n\nFor years the two disputed territories have survived on Russian military and economic assistance. Although Abkhazia seeks fuller independence, a large number of South Ossetians, perhaps 70 or 80 per cent of them, have Russian passports and would vote for membership of the Russian Federation. Both disputed territories use the rouble.\n\n\n\nBut this isn't, and never has been, just about Georgia. It is about the reassertion of regional power by a country which had smarted for years over the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eastward march of NATO, swallowing up former members of the Warsaw Pact.\n\n\n\nWhat we are seeing is a resurgent Russia currently prepared to strut the beach kicking sand in everybody's eyes and defying any affronted party to take them on.\n\n\n\nWhen NATO leaders met in the wake of the invasion of Georgia and came up with nothing more concrete than the \"suspension of normal relations\", the weakness of a divided West was all too obvious to Putin and Medvedev. They have now taken the next step down the line of provocation. \"Scrap the NATO-Russia Council altogether and see if we care!\" is the message.\n\n\n\nAnd, playing as the back-beat sub-theme through all this is the question of Kosovo, a question which looks very different according to whether you are seated in Moscow, Belgrade, Brussels or Washington.\n\n\n\n\"If it was right for the Kosovar Albanians to be given the right to declare independence from Serbia, then why shouldn't the people of South Ossetia be allowed to choose separation from Tblisi?\" demand the Medvedev-Putin supporters in the Russian Parliament.\n\n\n\n\"Ah yes,\" some say, \"but what about those threats from Moscow to turn Russian missiles against Poland now that the Poles have agreed to host the anti-missile batteries for the US missile defense plan? Isn't that a dangerous new escalation?\"\n\n\n\nAgain, it depends where you are sitting.\n\n\n\n\"How would Washington like it if the Russians were to stage anti-missile batteries in Mexico?\" is Moscow's answer.\n\n\n\nWhat seems to be forgotten amid the current rhetorical battle is that the threats to make Poland a target for Russian missiles are nothing new. Before the G8 summit back in 2007, Putin got the world in a tizzy with precisely the same threats, at that stage being used to stir Polish domestic opposition to the idea of hosting the missile battery.\n\n\n\nIn October 2007, Putin said the missile plan risked becoming a new Cuban missile crisis, probably the closest the world ever came to a nuclear war. Then, during an election, he threatened to point missiles at western Europe, walk away from a 1980s treaty limiting missiles and scrap a treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe (which Russia has since done).\n\n\n\nFirst Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov, then seen as Putin's potential successor, threatened to site cruise missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania. General Nikolai Saltsov, then in charge of Russia's ballistic arsenal, said last December: \"I do not exclude the missile defense shield sites in Poland and the Czech Republic being chosen as targets for our intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"\n\n\n\nThe big problem for the West (and especially next Monday's meeting of EU leaders, who need to make a more effective job of it than NATO's foreign ministers did last week), is just how to respond to Russia's current bout of strutting without making things worse-- and how to do it without cutting off their own noses in the process.\n\n\n\nThey could agree to make it harder for Russia to join the World Trade Organisation. They could even threaten to eject Russia from the G8. But what do they gain by doing so, especially those of them in the EU who depend on Russia for a hefty chunk of their energy supplies?\n\n\n\nFor years the West has been trying to draw Russia in, not push it further out into the cold. They need Russia's cooperation on climate change, on fighting terrorism, on achieving peace in the Middle East and on curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. And, let it not be forgotten, in keeping open NATO's supply routes for its mission in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe West is not ready to go to war over Russia's neighbors (or \"near abroad\" as Moscow terms it) but it does still have a role to play in the Russian economy. The EU may be dependent on Russian energy but it is also Russia's biggest customer.\n\n\n\nIt should use the economic levers it has, refuse to allow the Russians to pick off individual members with bilateral deals and learn to use its collective strength in demanding common standards of its fellow G8 member.\n\n\n\nThe worst thing it could do is to utter threats which it will not, or cannot, follow through.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A bill moving through Congress is intended, on its surface at least, to do something relatively simple: Crack down on the illegal pirating of movies, music and other copyrighted material.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a major online backlash has evolved, with everyone from lawmakers to Web-freedom advocates to some of technology's biggest players calling it a greedy and dangerous overreach that could have a chilling effect on free speech and innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle, Yahoo and Facebook are among the Web heavyweights who have joined the chorus against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which backers hope to have ready for a vote by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts intent is to help put a stop to foreign websites that illegally post, and sometimes sell, intellectual property from the United States. Federal law-enforcement agencies would be empowered to shut down those sites, and cut off advertising and online payments to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from American innovations go to American innovators,\" Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, chairman of the powerful House Judiciary committee and the sponsor of the plan, said when the bill was introduced last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bill prevents online thieves from selling counterfeit goods in the U.S., expands international protections for intellectual property, and protects American consumers from dangerous counterfeit products. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nIts supporters include some powerful lobbying groups, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the pharmaceutical industry and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other side are Web-freedom advocates, who were quick to say the effort goes too far. And this week, in the wake of a Wednesday hearing on the plan, that discontent grew louder and more widespread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our government is tampering with its basic structure so people will maybe buy more Hollywood movies,\" says an animated video by Kirby Ferguson, the New York filmmaker behind the Web video series \"Everything Is a Remix,\" that is making the rounds online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But Hollywood movies don't get grassroots candidates elected. They don't overthrow corrupt regimes, and the entire entertainment industry doesn't even contribute that much to our economy. The Internet does all these and more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps tellingly, that video was made in response to an earlier bill proposed in the Senate, which has since been put on hold by its sponsor. Ferguson has since added a message at the end of the video saying the issue has \"gotten much worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome critics fear that enforcement of the act is ill-defined and could allow federal authorities to go after sites that don't set out to illegally broadcast or sell content.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, advocates say, YouTube has housed important content, like video of political unrest in places like Egypt and Iran where government crackdowns had otherwise blocked media access. But YouTube also is home, albeit against its will, to music videos, movie clips and other content posted without the intent of its creators.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder SOPA, they say, a fledgling YouTube could have been shut down because of those posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, a letter opposing the House and Senate bills was sent to Congress, signed off on by AOL, eBay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twitter, Yahoo and Zynga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We support the bills' stated goals -- providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign 'rogue' websites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting,\" the letter reads. \"Unfortunately, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry's continued track record of innovation and job-creation, as well as to our nation's cybersecurity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo coincide with Wednesday's committee hearing, many websites devoted themselves to drawing attention to the debate. Blog platform Tumblr blacked out images in users' posts with a message urging users to \"Stop The Law That Will Censor The Internet!\" A post on Tumblr's staff blog claimed users flooded House lawmakers Wednesday with 87,834 phone calls protesting the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe backlash seems to be spreading to the halls of Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, announced her opposition to the plan on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Need to find a better solution than #SOPA #DontBreakTheInternet,\" she wrote, using hashtags that opponents have used to show their disapproval on the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven Pelosi's opponents from the other side of the ideological aisle agreed with her.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfluential California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa joined other conservative lawmakers, including presidential candidates Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul, in opposing the proposed law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't believe this bill has any chance on the House floor,\" Issa told The Hill on Wednesday. \"I think it's way too extreme, it infringes on too many areas that our leadership will know is simply too dangerous to do in its current form.\"",

  "context": "CHARLESTON, South Carolina (CNN) -- Sen. John Kerry on Thursday endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, saying the senator from Illinois is a \"candidate to bring change to our country.\"\n\n\n\n\"Barack Obama isn't just going to break the mold,\" said Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate four years ago. \"Together, we are going to shatter it into a million pieces.\"\n\n\n\nThe senator from Massachusetts made the announcement in front of an enthusiastic crowd in Charleston, South Carolina, 16 days ahead of the state's Democratic primary.\n\n\n\nKerry said he was stirred by the way Obama \"eloquently reminded us of the fact that our true genius is faith in simple dreams and insistence on small miracles.\"  Watch Kerry explain why he's picking Obama \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe endorsement could be seen as a blow to former Sen. John Edwards, who was Kerry's running mate in the 2004 election.\n\n\n\nEdwards also is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination this year.\n\n\n\nThe endorsement shouldn't come as a surprise to Edwards, who was publicly critical of Kerry's campaign after the earlier election.\n\n\n\nFollowing news of the endorsement, Edwards released a statement saying he respects Kerry's decision.\n\n\n\n\"When we were running against each other and on the same ticket, John and I agreed on many issues,\" Edwards said. \"I continue to believe that this election is about the future, not the past, and that the country needs a president who will fight aggressively to end the status quo and change the Washington system and to give voice to all of those whose voices are ignored in the corridors of power.\"\n\n\n\nKerry made an oblique reference to the other candidates in the race \"with whom I have worked and who I respect\" in his speech Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"They are terrific public servants, and each of them could be president tomorrow, and each would fight to take this country in the right direction, but I believe that more than anyone else, Barack Obama can help our country turn the page and get America moving by uniting and ending the division that we have faced,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA source suggested senator's support for Obama will be a big boost because Kerry \"remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party and [has] an e-mail list with millions of addresses.\"\n\n\n\nIn an e-mail sent to the JohnKerry.com community Thursday, the former presidential candidate said the next president of the United States \"can be, should be, and will be Barack Obama.\"\n\n\n\nA Kerry spokesman said Obama will be sending out a note to Kerry's e-mail list, which was created during the 2004 run and numbers 3 million.\n\n\n\nObama on Wednesday picked up endorsements from two key unions in Nevada, which holds its caucuses January 19.\n\n\n\nAtlanta, Georgia, Mayor Shirley Franklin recently announced her endorsement of Obama, and sources said Thursday that Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota also would back the senator from Illinois. E-mail to a friend\n\n\n\nCNN's Candy Crowley and Mark Preston contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Recent headlines focusing on the rash of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia should instead focus on the humanitarian crisis driving Somalis to commit crimes on the high seas, an international aid group said Thursday.\n\n\n\nSomalia's population have suffered from a lack of the most basic services.\n\n\n\nAn estimated one-third of Somalia's population desperately needs emergency aid, the international agency Oxfam said, as donors to Somalia met in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\n\n\"Without economic opportunities offering alternatives to criminality, and without law and order to curb these activities, then the massive economic returns of hijacking ships will continue to drive piracy,\" Robert Maletta, policy adviser for Oxfam, said in a news release.\n\n\n\n\"The international community must urgently focus their attention on finding ways to assist the millions of people in desperate need,\" Maletta said.\n\n\n\nSomalia, which is racked by poverty and conflict, has not had a fully functioning government since 1991, when its president was overthrown in Mogadishu, the capital. Drought and rising food prices have added to the nation's problems, according to Maletta.\n\n\n\n\"Families are finding it difficult to meet their most basic needs, as prices for basic food items are at record high levels,\" he said.\n\n\n\nNot only do civilians need emergency aid, they also need protection from military abuses, aid groups said.\n\n\n\n\"Since Somalia's security forces have committed so many violent abuses against civilians, efforts to strengthen them also need to make them more accountable,\" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director for Human Rights Watch.\n\n\n\nThe combination of security and humanitarian assistance is necessary to curb piracy in the region, which borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, aid groups said.\n\n\n\nThe April 8 hijacking of the U.S.-flagged cargo ship Maersk Alabama made headlines worldwide when its American captain, Richard Phillips, was held hostage by four Somali men.\n\n\n\nPhillips was rescued four days later, after U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates. The fourth suspect, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, was brought to New York to face federal piracy charges.\n\n\n\nShips with aid supplies destined for countries in the region, including Somalia, also have been hijacked in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\nPirates held a ship carrying U.N. food aid for 100 days in June 2005. Two years ago, a cargo ship and crew delivering U.N. aid to Somalia were held and released after 40 days.\n\n\n\nThe Maersk was going to the coastal town of Mombasa, Kenya, to deliver relief supplies intended for various countries in the region, including Somalia.",

It is one thing, though, to follow a dream and it is another to have an obsession,\" he told gathered reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchalke's Magath set to work a new miracle\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For Barca it is an obsession,\" added Mourinho, who was accompanied by tight security as he returned to the club where he began his coaching career under Bobby Robson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A dream is more pure than an obsession, an obsession is more about pride. Barca achieved a dream winning the Champions League in Paris and Rome last year but this time it is more about Madrid and playing at the Santiago Bernabeu, this is an obsession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho, who claimed the Champions League during his spell at Portuguese giants Porto, realizes that Inter are also desperate to triumph in Europe's premier club competition having last won it in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can't say for me it is a personal dream as I have won it before but I want to win it for Inter as it is more than 40 years since they got to the final.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I can help Mr Moratti (the Inter president), if I can help the players and if I can contribute a little bit as coach to achieve this dream then I would be very happy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInter will be without the suspended Dejan Stankovic but Mourinho indicated that he would likely take a gamble on key midfielder Wesley Sneijder, who has a slight hamstring strain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will see if he can play for 90 minutes as there is still a small problem. We have other important games in the league but I am ready to risk him as everything will be decided tomorrow,\" said Mourinho.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarcelona coach Pep Guardiola said his team were merely focused on earning a final clash against Bayern Munich, who beat Lyon 4-0 on aggregate in the first semifinal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a game of football, not a magic night, and we have to be ourselves -- we will go out and try to generate as many chances as we always do,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't know if we are capable of turning this around, but we will give everything against a great team to try and get to the final,\" he added.",

Watch U.S. military bomb poppy seeds \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"There is a nexus that needs to be broken between the insurgents and the drug traffickers,\" Wayne said. \"Also, it is part of winning the hearts and minds of the population because in some cases they are intimidated into growing poppies.\"\n\n\n\nIn a bid to encourage Afghan farmers to swap out their poppy plants for wheat crops the U.S. Agency for International Development has been offering them seeds, fertilizers and improved irrigation.\n\n\n\nObservers have noticed a significant decline in the opium trade in Afghanistan, with the number of poppy-free provinces increasing from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008, according to a U.N. report released last year.\n\n\n\nOpium cultivation in the country, which has 34 provinces, dropped by about 20 percent in a year, the U.N. reported in August.\n\n\n\n\"It's a challenge to deliver assistance in a war zone -- you can hear fighter jets flying above us right now,\" said Rory Donohoe, a USAID development officer.\n\n\n\n\"At the end of the day, what we found is successful is that we work in areas that we can work,\" he told CNN in a recent interview in Helmand province.\n\n\n\n\"We come to places like this demonstration farm where Afghans can come here to a safe environment, get training, pick up seeds and fertilizer, then go back to districts of their own.\"  Watch Afghans speak about the change in their farming practices \u00bb\n\n\n\nMany of Afghanistan's northern and eastern provinces have already benefited from USAID alternative farming programs, which have doled out more than $22 million to nearly 210,000 Afghans to build or repair 435 miles (700 kilometers) of roads and some 2,050 miles (3,300 kilometers) of irrigation and drainage canals.\n\n\n\nGiving Afghan farmers improved access to markets and improved irrigation is successfully weaning them away from poppy production, according to officials at USAID.\n\n\n\nOver the years, opium and heroin -- both derivatives of the poppy -- have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, most notably the Taliban movement that once ruled Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"If you can just help the people of Afghanistan in this way, the fighting will go away,\" said Abdul Qadir, a farmer in Lashkar Gah.\n\n\n\n\"The Taliban and other enemies of the country will also disappear.\"\n\n\n\nAtia Abawi contributed to this report",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Rust-colored oil washed ashore on barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi on Tuesday, while more patches of crude offshore appeared to be moving toward those states' coasts, authorities reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers scrambled to clean up tar balls and puddles of oil from the beaches of Alabama's Dauphin Island, while a strip of oil about two miles long and three feet wide stretched along Petit Bois Island, about five miles away off Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour's office reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt marked the first time oil has hit Mississippi's shores since the largest oil spill in U.S. history erupted in late April. And while tar balls associated with the Gulf spill had hit Dauphin Island, about 35 miles south of Mobile, in early May, residents said that Tuesday was the first time they had seen oil hitting the beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly part of the island's beaches have been lined with protective booms, with much of those barriers lined up near a protected wildlife area on the west end of the island.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnette Engel, a Louisiana State University researcher on Dauphin Island, said the oil is believed to be from BP's ruptured well off Louisiana. She predicted much more would be hitting the coast in coming days -- but vacationers remained on the beach, and some were still swimming in the blue-green waters as the cleanup continued.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd researchers from the Dauphin Island Sea Lab spotted large patches of the reddish-brown \"weathered\" oil during a water-sampling expedition offshore Tuesday, said John Dindo, the laboratory's associate director. Dindo said the oil spots on the water ranged from the size of a half-dollar coin to 30 to 40 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nA half-dozen boats could be seen skimming oil off the surface about 13 miles south of the island, he said. However, \"They were covering a very, very small spot in the ocean compared to what we saw,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration had warned earlier this week that the spreading slick from an undersea BP oil well was heading toward the Alabama and Mississippi coasts. Dindo said tides in the area are running east and winds have been out of the southwest, driving the oil toward beach towns on the eastern side of Mobile Bay.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said earlier Tuesday that authorities were investigating reports that the outer sheen of oil was reaching coastal waters off Mississippi and Alabama, but said those reports had not been confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've dispatched survey teams to see what the impact is out there, and to the extent that is required, we'll move resources that direction,\" Allen, the federal government's national incident commander, told reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Patrick Oppmann and Matt Smith contributed to this report.",

He said the police would continue to analyze other similarities.\n\n\n\nHowever, Kelly also noted that Starbucks has been the target of low-grade explosions in other cities.\n\n\n\nPolice plan to examine surveillance cameras for information that could lead investigators to the perpetrator, he said.",

No heavy machinery could be brought in to help in the rescue effort because many roads in the area were blocked.\n\n\n\nThe 7.0-magnitude temblor jolted the island on Wednesday shortly before 3 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET).

  "context": "(CNN) -- It arrived in Rich Stevens' mailbox a few weeks ago: the notice that Citibank had \"rate-jacked\" the Visa cards belonging to him and his wife.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome credit card holders have seen their interest rates go up dramatically, a practice called \"rate-jacking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my case, from 9.5 percent to 16.99,\" the 54-year-old nurse from the Long Island hamlet of Merrick, New York, told CNN. And his wife's rate zoomed from 7.95 percent to 16.99 percent, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens said he did not know why the rates had soared; his credit rating is great.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, like thousands of other credit card customers around the nation, he has been notified his rate is skyrocketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It almost borders on loan-sharking, from my perspective,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the blogosphere, writers are livid at the instant rate hikes -- called \"rate-jacking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCitigroup seems to be the target of most bloggers' venom -- partly because Citigroup issues so many credit cards and partly because Citi began sending the notices at about the same time it was getting a $20 billion, taxpayer-financed government bailout.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one at Citigroup would talk on camera to CNN about the matter. Instead, the company issued a written statement, which said: \"To continue funding in this difficult credit and funding environment, Citi is repricing a group of customers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCiti told CNN that anyone unhappy with the new rates can opt out and continue paying the lower interest, but they must close their account when their card expires. It's all in the fine print.\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, said she is sick of the fine print.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe agreed that credit card companies get away with whatever they want, as long at they put their desires into the fine print.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have this provision that says they can raise the rate -- any time, any reason,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September, Maloney got the House to pass by an overwhelming margin of 200 votes the \"credit card holders' bill of rights,\" which would have stopped rate-jacking and the imposition of other fees by banks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the bill has languished in the Senate since September. \"There's a lot of pushback from the financial industry,\" she said.  Watch how card companies are trying to woo customers \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics say that pushback is linked to donations from the banking industry to the politicians responsible for regulating credit cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Banking Committee is Christopher Dodd. His staff said the Connecticut Democrat has his own credit card bill containing tough language to stop things like rate-jacking and shortening of billing cycles -- two issues that anger consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even Dodd's own bill has failed to gain traction -- it has sat since July.\n\n\n\n\n\nDodd himself received more than $4 million from the financial sector during the last campaign, according to campaign records. His office did not respond to CNN's questions about that.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt did say that he has tried repeatedly to protect consumers, but added, \"legislation has been met with stiff opposition by the credit card industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the Federal Reserve is expected to vote on its own new rules regarding credit cards, rules in the works for four years that could clamp down on rate-jacking.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever is passed, Maloney said, probably would not take effect until 2010.",

Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates smile during Obama's speech Friday.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama attended a community service forum at Texas A&M University on Friday hosted by one of his Republican predecessors, former President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\n\nObama took the opportunity to emphasize that, regardless of partisan politics, the government can only do so much with the challenges facing Americans.\n\n\n\n\"We face threats to our health, our climate and, of course, our security that have left many of our young people wondering what kind of future they will be leaving for their own kids,\" Obama told the audience, which including the former president and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. \"Anyone here thinks that our government always has the solutions, President Bush and I will be the first to tell you that you'll be sorely disappointed.\"\n\n\n\n\"The government can build the best school, with the best teachers, but we can't run the PTA ... we can pass the most comprehensive health care reform bill, but Congress can't be on the ground in our communities caring for the sick and helping people lead healthy lives.\"\n\n\n\nThe two leaders met at Bush's presidential library to celebrate almost two decades of work from the Points of Light Institute, which was founded with Bush's encouragement in 1990 to \"encourage and empower the spirit of service,\" according to the group's Web site.\n\n\n\nThe Institute takes its name from Bush's 1989 inaugural address, where he referenced \"a thousand points of light ... all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good.\"\n\n\n\nObama lauded the former president's lifetime of service -- from his enlistment at 18 to his community work during retirement -- noting that Bush was the first president to create a White House office devoted to promoting volunteer work. The president said Bush's legacy of service affected the life of his own family.\n\n\n\n\"It's a vision that's changed lives across this country, including that of a young woman who went to work for an organization called Public Allies to prepare young people for public service careers -- an organization initially funded by the Bush administration,\" Obama said. \"Her experience there inspired her to devote her own life to serving others, and that young woman happens to be my wife, Michelle Obama.\"\n\n\n\nObama latched onto the community service theme during last year's presidential campaign. He signed a measure in April designed to strengthen national community service efforts by boosting federal funding for thousands of volunteers in fields ranging from clean energy to health care and education.\n\n\n\nThe Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, renamed to honor the late senator's sponsorship of the measure, will more than triple the number of positions in the AmeriCorps program, from 75,000 to 250,000, by 2017.\n\n\n\n\"Our government can help to rebuild our economy ... [but] we need Americans willing to mentor our eager young children, or care for the sick, or ease the strains of deployment on our military families,\" Obama said when signing the bill into law.\n\n\n\nThe law created four national service corps and launched several other initiatives, including, among other things, a \"Summer of Service\" program to spur greater community outreach by middle- and high-school students. Older Americans were encouraged to volunteer more through the creation of a \"Silver Scholars\" program, under which individuals 55 and older who perform 350 hours of service receive a $1,000 award.\n\n\n\nThe law increased the existing AmeriCorps educational stipend offered to volunteers to $5,350 -- the same amount as the maximum Pell college grant.\n\n\n\nSome critics have contended the measure, expected to cost roughly $6 billion over the next five years, is fiscally irresponsible in light of the current economic downturn. They also argue that the concept of volunteerism is undermined by providing financial compensation for community service.\n\n\n\nPoints of Light Institute CEO Michelle Nunn, however, praised the legislation for encouraging people to \"volunteer their time and talents to positively impact the nation's largest problems.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- She's traveled more than 35,000 kilometers hugging the equator, powered entirely by the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanetSolar, the world's largest solar powered boat, recently stopped off in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor as part of its 18-month journey around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring 31 meters (102 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide, the catamaran is powered by 537-square meters of photovoltaic solar panels.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a sunny day they produce on average 94 kilowatts of power -- the equivalent to 127 horsepower.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventy-five percent of the energy propels the boat that travels between 5 and 10 knots an hour. The remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat's navigational systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanetSolar is the brainchild of 39-year-old Swiss Raphael Domjan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile hiking in Iceland, the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday,\" Domjan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt in Germany at the cost of $26 million dollars, this vessel tracks the sun thanks to state-of-the-art solar technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can travel around three days with no light,\" explains Christian Ochsenbein, chief engineer aboard the boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But usually there is light everyday even if it's raining. So when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time, we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanet Solar set sail from Monaco in September 2010 crossing the Atlantic, the Panama Canal and is currently in the Pacific. Next stop is Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will then travel across the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal before finally returning to the Mediterranean where it plans to dock back in Monaco in May next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you cross to the south of the planet you always find rain, strong winds and big waves, so we passed all this with lots of patience and humility, because you are always humble against bad weather,\" Le Rouzic explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn every port, the catamaran and its message has been warmly received. It's hoped the shipping industry -- responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations -- embraces this technology the same way the public has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One day we won't have any more oil anywhere. Maybe it's in 50,100, 200 years but one day we will have no more oil and we'll have to find another way to live,\" Domjan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if Planet Solar completes its mission, the crew says that will be proof that the sun, and solar power, is the answer.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A former motor-racing engineer has unveiled a prototype of a new hydrogen-powered city car which claims to emit less than one third of the carbon emissions produced by its nearest rival.\n\n\n\nThe Riversimple Urban Car has been nine years in the making and needs further funding for city trials.\n\n\n\nThe creators of the 'Urban Car,' UK-based company Riversimple, say the vehicle emits less than 30 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide, less than one third of the carbon produced by the Polo Bluemotion.\n\n\n\nRiversimple founder Hugo Spowers has spent nine years researching and developing the prototype car.\n\n\n\n\"I think that the auto industry is focusing a lot of money on research and development at a basic science level on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology. We don't think it's necessary to do that,\" Spowers told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"We can use existing technology and integrate it into a whole system design approach -- that is where the breakthrough has come.\"\n\n\n\nSpowers is searching for extra funding to put the 'Urban Car' on the streets, but he says at this stage they won't be for sale. Riversimple plans to lease the car to customers for a monthly fee of \u00a3200 ($330). Hydrogen fuel for the cars will cost just 15 pence (25 cents) per mile.\n\n\n\nIt's a long way from the fuel-guzzling world Spowers used to inhabit as a designer and developer of high-powered racing cars. It was the industry's appalling environmental record that encouraged him to leave to try to find a way to make driving greener.\n\n\n\n\"Certainly the first five or six years were hard work because I did have an awful lot of people telling me I was mad,\" Spowers told CNN, at the launch of the Riversimple Urban Car in London.\n\n\n\n\"Gradually it all sort of gathered steam,\" he said, adding \"I'm absolutely convinced that we're offering a better solution for a segment of the transport problem and we'd be crazy not to pursue it.\"\n\n\n\nThe Urban Car's power comes from hydrogen fuel cells which are linked to four electric motors situated over each of the car's wheels. Almost all of the braking is done by the electric motors, which then capture the energy of the car in motion and store it in a bank of ultracapacitors. In conventional cars, the energy generated through braking is lost as heat.\n\n\n\nThe energy stored in the Urban Car's electric motors is enough to power 80 percent of the car's acceleration. That reduces the energy demands on the hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it can be one fifth of the size of one used in a normal car. The lighter fuel cell also makes it more energy efficient.\n\n\n\nA large part of the funding for the car's development came from the family of Ernst Pi\u00ebch, the eldest grandson of Ferdinand Porsche who founded the motor company of the same name in 1931.\n\n\n\nFerdinand Porsche's great-grandson Sebastien Pi\u00ebch is a partner in Riversimple. He says the company's nimble size has given it an advantage over larger car manufacturers whose future he says concerns him.\n\n\n\n\"It concerns me massively, because I don't see that the model they have now is very relevant to where consumers are going. Consumers are looking for a different solution. I'm not sure if what they're producing is working,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRiversimple plans to share the designs for its car through open-source licence agreements, a system more commonly used in the software industry. Designers and manufacturers will be invited to make improvements so the car evolves into the most efficient vehicle it can be.\n\n\n\n\"We don't believe that making money on IP (intellectual property) is really what's actually happening even now. We believe that service and providing the solution for customers will be where we make money,\" Pi\u00ebch told CNN.\n\n\n\nThe next step now is to find further financing, another \u00a320 million ($33 million), to build and test ten cars. Fifty prototypes will then be built for a pilot project in a small city. The location is still to be confirmed, but Riversimple has narrowed down its options to small towns in the United Kingdom, perhaps Oxford or Peterborough.\n\n\n\n\"I'm very confident we'll get it to market,\" Spowers said. \"I couldn't say hand on heart that I'm confident that we'll achieve what I think technically can be done. That's a bit in the lap of the gods and it's all to do with people, politics and business -- all a bit more unpredictable.\"",

And the association's executive director, Billy Hunter, said the owners are more dug in than in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commissioner had warned last week that such a cancellation may well be coming, at which time Los Angeles Lakers' guard and NBA Players Association President Derek Fisher acknowledged the stakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know our backs are against the wall in terms of regular season games and what those consequences will be,\" he said then.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe league's owners began a lockout of its players in early July.\n\n\n\n\n\nStern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe league lost as much as $300 million in the 2010-11 season, according to the commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than a week ago, the NBA canceled its preseason, which meant the loss of about $200 million in revenue, Stern said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of the players union's call for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current average salary is about $5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther big issues include a fight over a move by owners to get a bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last work stoppage occurred in 1998.",

  "context": "Clarksburg, West Virginia (CNN)  -- North Central West Virginia Airport boasts quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not surprising, considering that fewer than 20 people fly out of the facility on any given day. And all three scheduled daily departures to Washington have a stop in Morgantown, West Virginia, only 35 miles away. But the airport offers a special treat as the end of the year approaches -- free sightseeing flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to a Federal Aviation Administration program that gives small regional airports millions of dollars if they can reach a certain level of passenger traffic, the Clarksburg, West Virginia, facility tries its best to get 10,000 passengers off the ground by the end of the year. For Suzanne Pierson, that meant she and her grandson Donavan got an \"awesome\" bird's-eye view of Clarksburg and neighboring Bridgeport, West Virginia, from a chartered Boeing 757 last December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were trying to meet the quota, and they were 300 passengers short,\" said Pierson, who saw an ad placed by the airport advertising the free flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the difference between 10,000 and 9,999 is the difference between $1 million and $150,000 in federal funds, airport managers in Clarksburg and other small towns do whatever they can to get over that number. In Kearney, Nebraska, residents get to take aerial tours of the city's Christmas lights for $15. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, residents got free 10-minute flights to reach the local airfield's goal of 10,000 passengers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who is a frequent critic of federal spending, said \"about 40\" airports are believed to offer similar flight programs to reach the threshold, which was set by Congress. Coburn is asking the FAA and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to come up with a definitive figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The whole purpose for that isn't to say what you're doing is illegal -- it's probably not -- but to have a more cogent policy that truly represents the needs based on enplanements for every airport,\" Coburn said. He said federal support for small airports like Clarksburg's \"should be earned in terms of grant process,\" not by gaming the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We created the incentive to kind of weasel on it so you can get more money, and it's exacerbated now because of the economic downturn,\" Coburn said.\n\n\n\n\n\nClarksburg is about 200 miles west of Washington and about 110 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where most area residents catch flights when they travel by air. But airport director Rick Rock said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contributes about $395 million into the local economy, \"So I definitely think there's no question that we need this airport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the $1 million based on passenger traffic, the Clarksburg airport got $30 million to lengthen its runway in 1999 and another $1.6 million from the Obama administration's economic stimulus bill in 2009. Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said. And the airport just got another $150,000 grant from the FAA to promote itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nRock said the money is needed to meet FAA mandates for security, runway paving and safety, and he's proud of what the facility has achieved -- particularly for students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're trying to introduce aviation to them at a young age, so they can look at it as a career,\" he said. \"A lot of these kids have never had the chance to fly. We've been able to share that opportunity, and the kids love it. It's special.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Coburn said at least five airports have used \"creative ways\" to keep the money flowing in and has managed to get support for a congressional investigation to find out how airports like North Central West Virginia can get so much money for so few passengers.",

Police said six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones, and the teen was shot as he tried to throw a fuel-filled bomb at the officers.\n\n\n\nThe shooting occurred in a neighborhood where there have been regular clashes with police, but it immediately sparked clashes and riots in Athens and Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city. The violence then spread to other municipalities.  Watch iReporter John Kountouris' videos of the violence \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe events have exacerbated the unpopularity of the ruling party and left Greek Prime Minister Konstandinos Karamanlis scrambling to shore up support.  Watch crowds gathered for funeral \u00bb\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, he met with President Karolos Papoulias and cabinet members before briefing political leaders on the country's security situation.\n\n\n\nOpposition leader George Papandreou of the left-wing PASOK party said: \"The country does not have a government that can protect its citizens, their rights, or their safety.\n\n\n\n\"I told Mr. Karamanlis that our society, our citizens are experiencing a multiple crisis: an economic crisis, a social crisis, an institutional crisis, and a crisis of values. And the government is unable to address these crises; they have lost the confidence of the Greek people.\"  See images of anarchy on Greek streets \u00bb\n\n\n\nKaramanlis ruled out early elections and called for all political parties to stand together against violence.\n\n\n\n\"It's our responsibility to maintain a united stance against illegal acts,\" he said in statement. \"We must condemn in the strongest terms, with pure reason and not minced words - the violence, pillaging, and vandalism, that hampers social peace.\"\n\n\n\nThe government called on union leaders to cancel a national strike planned for Wednesday, fearing it could lead to further violence. But the labor movement refused, saying the action was planned before the shooting of the boy and was unrelated to it.\n\n\n\nCleaning crews worked for hours early Tuesday to clear the mess left by the riots, but evidence of the violence remained. In some places, entire rows of shops still have broken windows. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video of rioting\n\n\n\nThe mayor of Athens asked residents not to dispose of garbage for a day because many of the city's trash bins were destroyed in the violence.\n\n\n\nKaramanlis vowed again Tuesday that those responsible for the violence would be punished.\n\n\n\n\"I assured the president that no leniency will be tolerated in holding people accountable,\" he told reporters. \"No one has the right to use this tragic incident as an alibi for actions of raw violence.\"\n\n\n\nAthens police said 12 policemen were injured in Monday's violence and 87 people were arrested. There were 10 flashpoints across Athens where police confronted rioters, police said.  Watch protesters clash with police \u00bb\n\n\n\nMany of the young people who rioted holed up at universities, taking advantage of a decades-old rule that bars police from entering university grounds. The rule came into force after tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the ruling military junta.\n\n\n\nThe dean of Athens University resigned Tuesday as a result of the students' violent behavior.\n\n\n\nPublic and private schools and universities across the country were shut again Tuesday. Watch as iReporter witnesses the clashes\n\n\n\nDemonstrators torched government buildings and the offices of the ruling conservative party in central Athens. They also set cars and trash containers ablaze.\n\n\n\nMonday, young demonstrators barricaded streets in Athens and Thessaloniki and hurled gasoline bombs as they battled police. Clouds of tear gas hung over the capital as police tried to disperse the crowds.\n\n\n\nThe police officer who fired the fatal shot at the teenage boy has been charged with \"manslaughter with intent\" and suspended from duty, police said, adding that a second police officer was arrested Saturday on criminal accessory charges.\n\n\n\nGovernment officials, including the interior minister, have condemned the shooting.\n\n\n\nAuthorities conducted an autopsy on the boy Monday in an effort to clarify the circumstances of the shooting, but the boy's family has called in their own investigators to verify state findings, the Athens coroner told CNN.\n\n\n\nCNN's Eileen Hsieh and Phil Black, and Journalist Anthee Carassava, contributed to this report",

Under Chile's constitutional term limits, a president cannot run for a second consecutive term.\n\n\n\nBachelet endorsed Frei, a member of her same left-leaning coalition, but another leftist candidate who ran as an independent -- Enriquez-Ominami -- made an impressive run, pulling in 20 percent of the vote and splitting votes for the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThose who voted for him, \"have affirmed the desire for Chile to move forward and toward the future,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIf Pinera triumphs in the expected January runoff election, it would mark the first time since the fall of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship that a conservative wins at the polls. In the 19 years since Pinochet's fall, all the presidents have come from the left-leaning coalition.\n\n\n\nPinera, 60, is one of the country's wealthiest businessmen who previously served as a senator and president of the National Renovation party.\n\n\n\nSince completing one term as president, Frei returned to politics as a Christian Democrat senator who has campaigned on continuing Bachelet's policies.\n\n\n\nWhile Frei and Pinera were household names before the election, it was the 36-year-old Enriquez-Ominami who made a political name for himself in this presidential election.\n\n\n\nHe worked as a television director before being elected as a congressman for the Socialist party in 2005. The son of a guerrilla leader from the 1970s, Enriquez-Ominami forged his own political path, breaking from the leftist coalition and running on his own.\n\n\n\nA fourth candidate, Arrate of the Communist Party, garnered 6 percent of Sunday's vote, according to the early vote figures.",

  "context": "Berlin (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI met Friday with a group of people who had been sexually abused by clergy in his native Germany, where disenchantment with the Roman Catholic Church has grown in the wake of the scandal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting, which occurred at a seminary in Erfurt, came on the second day of the pontiff's four-day visit to his homeland. Besides talking with victims of sexual abuse committed by priests and church personnel, he also met with people \"who care for those injured by these crimes,\" according to a statement from the Vatican press office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Moved and deeply shaken by the sufferings of the victims, the Holy Father expressed his deep compassion and regret over all that was done to them and their families,\" the statement added. \"He assured the people present that those in positions of responsibility in the church are seriously concerned to deal with all crimes of abuse and are committed to effective measures for the protection of children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pope has had similar meetings elsewhere, in the face of outcries from many nations in Europe, North America and beyond criticizing the church for its handling of sexual abuse cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday's visit was unique in that it took place in the homeland of Benedict, where he'd also served as a cardinal. He himself got caught up in the scandal in at least one case, when he -- as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- approved the transfer of a man within Germany in the wake of accusations that the man had abused children.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the archdiocese has said the then-cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man's case. In March 2010, the priest -- then identified only as H -- was suspended, the archdiocese of Munich and Freising announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years earlier, enthusiasm was high in Germany's Catholic community when Benedict was named pope. But the sex abuse scandal, and a perception that a conservative church is unlikely to change its ways, has affected the church in the European nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Der Spiegel magazine, more than 181,000 Catholics have left the church since the scandal broke. And candidates for the priesthood have plummeted 62% since 1990, according to the German Bishops Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile he has visited Germany three times since 2005, this marks Benedict's first state visit as pope.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulf. He also gave a speech before the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, in which he spoke of the \"inviolable dignity of every single human person.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBenedict began his day Friday with a mass in Berlin and he met with 15 representatives of Germany's Muslim community. In a subsequent speech, he said, \"the convictions (Catholics and Muslims) are becoming visible\" while adding that \"constant effort is needed in order to foster better mutual acquaintance and understanding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There can be a fruitful collaboration between Christians and Muslims,\" Benedict said in the speech, a transcript of which was provided by the Vatican. \"We can offer an important witness in many key areas of life in society (such as) the protection of the family based on marriage, respect for life in every phase of its natural course or the promotion of greater social justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Rick Noack contributed to this report.",

Christopher Sullivan on Friday night at a homecoming party in Sullivan's native San Bernardino, California. He also faces charges on \"allegations involving premeditation and the use and discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury,\" the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJurado \"will deny any and all allegations,\" defense attorney Michael Holmes said in a written statement to CNN on Wednesday. \"We anticipate receiving the initial discovery of police reports and any other evidence that the district attorney has at this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHolmes noted that the court \"allows video arraignment,\" but said he and Jurado had \"discussed this process and he wanted to be present in court during the entire process. He requested to be present and the next available date is tomorrow (Thursday) morning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party in Sullivan's honor was to celebrate his recent return to California from Kentucky, where he was stationed while recovering from wounds sustained in a suicide bombing a year ago in Afghanistan. The bombing killed five members of his unit and left him with a cracked collarbone and brain damage, according to the San Bernardino County Sun. Sullivan received the Purple Heart, the newspaper reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the party, Sullivan was shot twice after an argument and physical confrontation with Jurado, who fled the scene, according to police and witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fight broke out after Jurado and Sullivan's younger brother began arguing about football, the brothers' mother, Suzanne Sullivan, told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nJurado turned himself in to authorities in Chino Hills, California, on Monday afternoon, said Lt. Gwendolyn Waters.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Sullivan's mother told CNN he was \"on 100% life support.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He can move his head and he responds through nodding and blinking to us. His eyes aren't always open, but we try to encourage him to do so as often as possible,\" Suzanne Sullivan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said her son asked what had happened to him and wanted to know why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We told him what it was about and he just closed his eyes,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Sullivan said her family is having a difficult time coming to terms with what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it,\" she said. \"But to see he survived that, and now for this to happen to him, just breaks my heart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Stella Chan and Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.",

Nobody's dead. That's the biggest thing,\" Baskin said.\n\n\n\nThe storm system was becoming less intense as it moved east Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said, but the National Weather Service issued tornado and severe storm warnings and said extreme weather still was possible.\n\n\n\nPresident Bush said Wednesday he had called the governors of the affected states to offer help and to tell them that \"the American people hold those who suffered up in prayer.\"\n\n\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency was deploying teams to the area, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"We're going to keep watching this,\" he said.

Her baby was found alive 250 yards away. The child was taken to a local hospital, Austin said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Tennessee Highway Patrol reported looting in hard-hit Macon County, CNN affiliate WSMV reported.\n\n\n\nMacon County Mayor Shelvy Linville told CNN Thursday that the death toll in the county had risen to 13.\n\n\n\nTennessee Gov.

It's just 25 miles of a tornado sitting on the ground.\"\n\n\n\nIn Jackson, Tennessee, a tornado trapped Union University students and retirees in collapsed buildings, said Julie Oaks, a spokeswoman for the state's Emergency Management Agency.

Many other school buildings received lesser damage.  See photos of chaos left by storm \u00bb\n\n\n\nClasses were canceled at least until February 18, he said.\n\n\n\nNine students were hospitalized overnight, but there were no life-threatening injuries, according to university spokesman Tim Elsworth.\n\n\n\nTo the west, a tornado swept through the southeastern section of Memphis in Shelby County. The storms yanked the roof off a hangar at Memphis International Airport, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\n\nOaks said one person was killed at the Hickory Ridge Mall in Shelby County.\n\n\n\nCompany officials believe a tornado hit a compressor station for the Columbia Gulf Transmission company in Hartsville, Tennessee, about 40 miles northeast of Nashville, setting off a spectacular natural gas fire.  Watch flames leap hundreds of feet \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe blaze could be seen in the night sky for miles around, with flames shooting \"400, 500 feet in the air,\" said Tennessee Emergency Management spokesman Donnie Smith.\n\n\n\nThe station was damaged significantly, but there were no reports of injuries or fatalities, said Columbia spokesman Kelly Merritt. \"We would not have had any employees there [overnight].\" The blaze was put out early Wednesday morning, he said.\n\n\n\nThe tornado cut a wide swath near the facility, flattening the home of Dara Reasonover.\n\n\n\n\"It just took the house and everything and my horses and my dog,\" a shaken Reasonover said, as the glow of the fire lit the sky behind her. \"I don't know if they're alive or dead, but we'll make it.\"\n\n\n\nIn Arkansas, the storm killed 13 people in six counties, the state Emergency Management Agency said.\n\n\n\nIn the city of Atkins, a man, woman and child in the same family were killed, county Judge Jim Ed Gibson told CNN. The storms overturned trucks and other vehicles along Interstate 40, closing the highway briefly, he said.\n\n\n\nStorms also ripped through Kentucky, killing at least seven people. A state of emergency was declared in Muhlenberg County, and Kentucky National Guard troops were deployed, state emergency spokesman Buddy Rogers said.\n\n\n\nIn Alabama, the storms killed four people, three in Lawrence County and one in Jackson County, officials said.\n\n\n\nResident Roger Riddle said that when he heard the tornado siren, he rounded up his children and took them to a community storm shelter.\n\n\n\nWhen he emerged, he saw the twister traveling away from them and \"total destruction.\"\n\n\n\n\"We've got things tore up, and the house across the road from us is completely gone,\" Riddle said.\n\n\n\nIn Mississippi, the director of the state's Emergency Management Agency, Mike Womack, estimated that 20 to 30 tornadoes pounded the state in areas above the state capital of Jackson.\n\n\n\n\"We have no reported fatalities, and that is extremely fortunate,\" he said, given the havoc the storm caused elsewhere.

  "context": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The wounds of partition festered again this week in India, resulting in the banning of a book and the expulsion of a respected politician.\n\n\n\nProtesters burn an effigy of Jaswant Singh over his book; the former foreign minister was ousted from his party.\n\n\n\nThe home state of the father of Indian independence, Mahatma Gandhi, forbade the sale and circulation of a new book it says spews revisionist history about the birth of secular but predominantly Hindu India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\n\n\nWritten by Jaswant Singh, a former federal minister and senior member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the book calls Mohammed Ali Jinnah, considered by Indians the architect of the partition, a great man who is wrongly demonized. Jinnah went on to become the first governor general of Pakistan.\n\n\n\nIn \"Jinnah: India, Partition and Independence,\" Singh absolves the Pakistani leader as the man responsible for dividing the subcontinent, suggesting instead that it was another beloved independence leader, Sardar Patel, who played a major role.\n\n\n\n\"The book wrongfully portrays the fateful partition of our nation,\" the Gujarat state government said in a statement. \" Such a brainchild has no historic background at all. In the larger interest of society, the state government has decided to impose a ban on the book.\"\n\n\n\nThe BJP accused Singh of deviating from the party's \"core ideology\".\n\n\n\n\"We always respect freedom of expression but can never compromise our ideology,\" Sidharth Nath Singh, a party spokesman, told CNN. \"You just can't eulogize Jinnah and accuse Sardar Patel instead.\"\n\n\n\nSingh, a widely respected politician known for his moderate views within the ranks of a conservative party, found it appalling that freedom of expression was threatened in the world's largest democracy.\n\n\n\n\"The day we start banning books, we are banning thinking,\" Singh told reporters.\n\n\n\nHe defended his work and said he did not understand the objection to his writings about Patel, who, as India's first home minister, banned the Hindu revivalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the mother organization of the BJP, after the assassination of Gandhi in 1948.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know which part of the core belief I have demolished,\" Singh said.\n\n\n\nNearly 350 years of British rule ended in 1947 when an agreement for independence was reached to give Muslims their own homeland. Indians think of Jinnah as the man who pushed a two-state notion based on religion as a prerequisite for freedom.\n\n\n\nIn the days that followed, an estimated 1 million people died in a border-crossing exodus. Muslims fled from India into Pakistan while Hindus clamored to find new homes in India.\n\n\n\nThe animosities fueled by that bloody birth -- including three wars fought by India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- continue to haunt Indians, said journalist and author Tarun Tejpal.\n\n\n\n\"This flashpoint played out in public is a reminder of those wounds,\" Tejpal said of the book dispute.\n\n\n\nAs a book of history written by a politician, it might have been inconsequential, Tejpal said. But as a book about the partition, it was incendiary.\n\n\n\n\"What happened 62 years ago continues to haunt us in a very bitter way,\" Tejpal said. \"We can't seem to leave our baggage in the past.\"\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time that Pakistan's founder has caused trouble for a Hindu nationalist. BJP President Lal Krishna Advani was forced to temporarily step down in 2005 for praising Jinnah's secularism during a trip to Pakistan.\n\n\n\nPolitical observers say the Singh controversy reflects a battle for the soul of the BJP, beleaguered by electoral defeats and vicious infighting.\n\n\n\nMany in India view the BJP as a divisive force attempting to gain power by exploiting Hindu-Muslim tensions. Advani was charged in the 1992 demolition of the 16th-century Babri mosque in the central Indian city of Ayodhya, though he was later acquitted in that case.\n\n\n\nJournalist K.G. Suresh, a longtime observer of conservative politics in India, said the BJP is struggling to figure out how to stay electable, whether to move right or stay closer to the center.\n\n\n\n\"Jaswant Singh's book is a manifestation of that clash,\" Suresh said.\n\n\n\nSingh's political climb is likely over, but what of younger Indians, now generations removed from those who remember independence? Tejpal for one, senses the wounds could keep reopening. And that, he said, \"doesn't bode well.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Investigators expanded their search into Texas Monday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma Sunday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities also are trying to find the dead woman's estranged husband, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night, the bureau said. Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs' estranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's home, the bureau said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLester Hobbs, 46, and Aja are missing and are presumed to be in Hobbs' car, said investigators who issued an Amber Alert to try to find her. Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas authorities also issued an Amber Alert, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said. Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport, Texas, and the alert was issued preemptively, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night. Authorities did not say how Hobbs died, but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RV belonged to Lester Hobbs, and was parked at his relatives' home, Richard Goss, agent in charge of the state bureau of investigation's Lawton, Oklahoma, office, told reporters Monday. Hobbs' relatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tanya Hobbs or Aja, and one of them pried open the door and discovered Tanya Hobbs' body, he said. Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hobbses were separated, but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile, Goss said. The couple had been together for about five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nA medical examiner was performing an autopsy, the bureau said, and police want to question Lester Hobbs about the death.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and the girl are believed to be traveling in his car, a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag number 577-BPW. The two-door car has no hubcaps, and the rear passenger window is covered in plastic, the bureau said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our main concern at this time is to find the little girl,\" Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters. \"We know that she does need some medication,\" and authorities were checking leads regarding that, he said. He did not specify Aja's medical condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history but did not elaborate. The Sheriff's Office said he had prior felony convictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAja's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said. She has brown eyes, and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black.\n\n\n\n\n\nLester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, with hazel eyes and brown hair, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The agency released a picture of him and said he has a mustache but no longer has a goatee.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeronimo is about 12 miles south of Lawton, Oklahoma, in the south-central part of the state.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two customers are suing Wal-Mart for negligence after being injured in a mad rush for post-Thanksgiving bargains that left one store employee dead, the men's attorney said Tuesday.\n\nA temporary worker at this Wal-Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week.\n\nTemporary Wal-Mart worker Jdimytai Damour, 34, was crushed to death as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a store on Long Island at 5 a.m. Friday.\n\nAttorney Kenneth Mollins said Fritz Mesadieu and Jonathan Mesadieu were \"literally carried from their position outside the store\" and are now \"suffering from pain in their neck and their back from being caught in that surge of people\" that rushed into the Wal-Mart.\n\nNew York Newsday reported that the Mesadieus are father and son, ages 51 and 19.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the Mesadieus' injuries were a result of \"carelessness, recklessness, negligence.\"\n\nIn a claim against the Nassau County police department, the men also contend that they \"sustained monetary losses as a result of health care and legal expenses ... in the sum of $2 million.\"\n\n\"This is a tragic situation that could have and should have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable care. There are very simple measures that could have been put in place to avoid this, such as barriers along the line to spread people out, extra security and a better police presence,\" Mollins said.\n\nHe said his clients and others who were at the scene contend that the police \"were there ... saw what was happening, and they left.\"\n\nCalls seeking comment from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. were not immediately returned.\n\nLt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County Police Department said, \"it's our policy that we don't comment on open litigations\" and would not respond directly to Mollins and his clients' claim that officers left the scene.\n\nHe said it is \"incumbent upon the store to provide security\" but noted that there was no security force present when officers responded to an initial phone call after 3 a.m. Friday for an unknown disturbance at the site.\n\nSmith said the officers noticed a lack of order with the crowd and began to organize them into a line, remaining on site for about 30 minutes until the crowd had become orderly.\n\nThroughout the morning, officers went back to check on the crowd and continued to notice no disturbance, Smith said.\n\nHe said that there were no additional calls for assistance until about 5 a.m., when people began rushing the doors of the store and trampled Damour.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Damour died of asphyxiation after being trampled, Nassau County officials have said.\n\nVideo showed that as many as a dozen people were knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the store. The employee was \"stepped on by hundreds of people\" as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd, said Nassau County Police Detective Lt. Michael Fleming.\n\nCNN's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report",

  "context": "NORCROSS, Georgia (CNN) -- Beneath seven flat-screen TVs and one large pulldown screen, members of the Racquet Club of the South gathered Monday to watch and celebrate one of their own.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Racquet Club of the South erupt when Melanie Oudin beats Nadia Petrova.\n\n\n\nMelanie Oudin, 17, of Marietta, Georgia, has taken the tennis world by storm at the U.S. Open.\n\n\n\nThe 70th-ranked female has upset some of the sport's biggest female stars, including Russian aces Elena Dementieva (No. 4 seed) and Maria Sharapova (No. 29 seed, who has been ranked No. 1 worldwide in the past). And on Monday, she beat 13th seed Nadia Petrova in three sets.\n\n\n\nHer latest win makes her the youngest American to make the quarterfinals since Serena Williams in 1999.\n\n\n\n\"It's still so surreal,\" said Anne Keeton, player liaison at the club, before the match started. \"She sort of wins no matter what happens. She's there going for it and not giving up.\"\n\n\n\nAt this suburban club, co-owned and co-directed by Oudin's longtime coach, Brian de Villiers, articles about the local tennis phenom dot the walls. In the Grill, on a Bud Light message board above drink specials, are the words \"Congratulations Melanie!\" And a photo of her mixed in with other young players is posted near a downstairs fitness room.\n\n\n\nBlending in with others and not retreating to \"a Melanie court\" is part of what makes her special, Keeton said. When there was a flood on some indoor courts this year, she was down there squeegeeing with everyone else.\n\n\n\n\"She so lovely and so accessible,\" Keeton said. \"It couldn't happen to a nicer kid.\"\n\n\n\nThe restaurant buzzed as tables filled with more than 80 onlookers who were courtside in spirit. They feasted on a spread laid out to mark the special occasion as the match started.  Watch friends, family cheer Oudin on \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen Petrova took the upper hand, and the first set, fans erupted into applause with each of Oudin's hard-earned points and offered encouragement like \"There we go!\" When she pumped her fist in celebration, they did the same. And when a play didn't go her way, they groaned in unison.\n\n\n\nHer skills were apparent from an early age, said Turhan Berne of Norcross, a coach and tournament director who's known Oudin since she was 9. He watched her rake in wins, beating older kids and snagging No. 1 junior rankings in the country and world.\n\n\n\n\"But you know when I knew she was going to be something?\" he said. \"She would play with anybody her coach had her hit with. ... She always gave back. She's very grounded. Her parents and coach did a great job not letting her fame and success change her into a different person.\"\n\n\n\nAs Oudin came back for the second set, the crowd held its collective breath. With every point she earned, they hooted, hollered and exchanged high-fives. They booed when they saw Petrova losing her cool, banging her racquet against the net after losing a big point.\n\n\n\n\"C'mon, Melanie!\" people screamed as the tiebreaker began in the second set. When Oudin took that set, they rose to their feet, screamed, did happy dances and shared hugs.\n\n\n\n\"It's awesome,\" said Kathleen Brady of Norcross. \"We are so glad her opponent double-faults.\"\n\n\n\n\"Bless her heart,\" Lisa Wells chimed in with a laugh, offering the Southern tagline to downplay any insult.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, John Sklare joked that the young pro learned something from him. Over the winter, the Alpharetta psychologist often played on the indoor court beside her.\n\n\n\n\"I knew she was good, but I didn't know she was that good -- and that's what we're all finding out now,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe spoke about what a \"great kid\" Oudin is but then added that what he likes best about her is how quiet she is on the court.\n\n\n\nSklare, a former writer for Atlanta Tennis magazine, said he called Sharapova \"Screamapova.\"\n\n\n\nOudin, on the other hand, is \"like a stealth fighter,\" he said. \"She's quiet, but you know she's there.\"\n\n\n\nHer overall attitude is as inspiring as her play, said Jeannette Latimer of Decatur, Georgia, whose 11-year-old daughter, Kelsey, has been playing for five years.\n\n\n\n\"She shows the kids not to get upset on the court,\" Latimer said. \"She's always so positive. If the kids learn nothing else from her, it's her mental toughness.\"\n\n\n\nBut Kelsey has been more intent on studying Oudin's moves on the court. \"I think she has a nice top-spin forehand,\" Kelsey said. \"I think it's better than mine.\"\n\n\n\nWith Oudin up 5-2 in the third set, anticipation hung in the air.\n\n\n\n\"Both of them are pressing each other, but to see the 70 [ranked player] outplaying 13, that takes heart,\" Ernie Jensen of Woodstock said.\n\n\n\nGoing into the match point, some rose to their feet. Together, the hordes clapped, carrying Oudin to the win. When she took the match, earning her first quarterfinal seat in a Grand Slam, the room exploded.\n\n\n\nThey stood by and watched, smiling widely and some wiping away tears as Oudin gave her victory speech.\n\n\n\n\"It's like something so big happening to all of us all at once,\" said Jennifer Silverberg of Alpharetta. \"Watching her, it's like watching your own little girl. ... My heart's still going crazy.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A few weeks ago, Tony Hoard, a 57-year-old manufacturing worker in Indiana, boarded a flight on Midwest Airlines to Las Vegas, Nevada, with his Australian Shepherd. The flight attendant smiled at the two and said, \"Welcome aboard.\"\n\n\n\nMidwest Airlines allows some of its canine customers to be seated in the cabin.\n\n\n\nHoard has flown with Rory, his furry 40-pound companion, in coach more than 15 times on Midwest, the Wisconsin-based airline that boasts \"The Best Care in the Air.\" Each time they fly, Rory wears a harness and sits strapped into a seat.\n\n\n\n\"Rory gets the window seat,\" said Hoard, whose dog has won a series of Frisbee competitions. \"He likes to look out the window when the plane takes off and naps the rest of the way.\"\n\n\n\nBlame America's pet obsession, but in recent years, more members of the airline industry are embracing dogs and cats on board. Midwest Airlines may be an extreme example, letting select dogs sit in the same seats as humans, but other airlines are relaxing their pet policies by letting smaller cats and dogs come into the cabin area.\n\n\n\nAbout a year ago, Midwest began allowing certain \"celebrity\" dogs that appear in canine competitions, shows or advertisements to sit in seats.\n\n\n\n\"They are just passengers with four legs instead of two,\" said Susan Kerwin, who oversees the pet program at Midwest Airlines.\n\n\n\nThe pet travel frenzy has spurred the creation of an airline catering exclusively to pets. This month, Pet Airways, the nation's first pet-only airline, will begin flying in five major cities, including New York and Los Angeles, California. It's an alternative to shipping larger pets in the cargo area of a plane, where there have been pet injuries and even deaths. Chart: Compare some of the common airline fees\n\n\n\n\"The owners can check a bag with them,\" explained Alyse Tognotti, a spokeswoman for Pet Airways. \"Or if they have a special blanket or toy, basically anything that will take stress out of traveling.\"\n\n\n\nOn each Pet Airways flight, services include potty breaks and experienced animal handlers checking up on the animals every 15 minutes. Nervous parents can track their pets online.\n\n\n\nSouthwest Airlines was the latest airline to join the pet-loving bandwagon in May, when it permitted small dogs and cats to travel in the cabin area. The pets must sit in an approved kennel that fits under the seat.\n\n\n\n\"I wasn't going to fly Southwest Airlines,\" said Katie Chapman, 37, of Louisville, Kentucky, who is mom to a friendly 18-pound Cairn Terrier that resembles Toto from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Since the airline has changed its policy, she plans to take her puppy on a Southwest flight to California this fall. \"I'm so glad now that she will be able to go with me.\"\n\n\n\nEach year, airlines transport hundreds of thousands of pets in the cargo and cabin areas. Continental reported moving 270,000 pets last year in cabin and cargo, more than triple the number moved before the airline's pet program officially kicked off eight years ago.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration doesn't have restrictions on whether animals can be in the cabin area, but airlines must allow service dogs for the disabled on board. Only cats and dogs are allowed in the cabin areas on most airlines. In the cargo area, other pets like rabbits, birds and lizards can be stowed.\n\n\n\nThe cost of flying your furry friend ranges from $75 to nearly $300 each leg. It's a hefty price tag, but profit-bleeding airlines are happy to offer the option.\n\n\n\nPets can even rack up frequent flier miles. After three flights with Midwest, the pet can earn a fourth flight free. Continental and JetBlue Airways' programs credit the pet's trip on the owner's frequent flier account.\n\n\n\nBut one airline is catering to allergy-ridden customers who don't want pets in the cabin. Last year, Frontier Airlines banned pets from the cabin area because officials said pet allergies are common among their customers.\n\n\n\nAnn Kerns, a 63-year-old teacher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, experienced continuous wheezing on a four-hour US Airways flight to Phoenix, Arizona. At the end of the flight, she was shocked to find that there had been a cat sitting under her seat.\n\n\n\n\"What would have happened if I went into an attack at 35,000 feet in the air?\" she asked.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the American College of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology wrote letters to Congress expressing concern about pets riding in the cabin area after some patients became ill from their flights. The letters didn't go very far, officials said.\n\n\n\nAirlines say they have had few allergy injuries on board. The airlines limit the number of pets in the cargo area to about five. The aircraft is disinfected and cleaned routinely, so dander and hairs aren't a problem, airline officials say.\n\n\n\nBut not every traveler has had smooth experiences with pets on board.\n\n\n\nTerry Trippler, a travel expert, recalls an unpleasant incident years ago when a dog had diarrhea three rows in front of him.\n\n\n\n\"You could certainly smell it,\" he wrote in an e-mail. \"The only real way to solve the problem is no pets in the cabin.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Two teenage girls from Great Britain will fly home Thursday after spending a year behind bars in Ghana for drug-smuggling, the British High Commission in the west African country said.\n\n\n\nThe girls were stopped by customs officials at Accra trying to smuggle drugs back to Britain.\n\n\n\nGhanaian police arrested the teenagers, identified as Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, in July 2007 as they prepared to board a British Airways flight to London.\n\n\n\nWhen officials searched their laptop bags as part of departure formalities, they found about 13 lbs (6 kg) of cocaine.\n\n\n\nThe girls, now 17, were 16 at the time of their arrest. They faced a maximum sentence of three years.\n\n\n\nUK media have named the girls as Yatunde Diya and Yasemin Vatansever of north London.\n\n\n\nIn January, a juvenile court in Ghana sentenced the pair to nine months in jail for trying to smuggle cocaine out of the country.\n\n\n\nAt the time, a British Foreign Office spokesman said the teens would not have to serve the full sentence because they had already spent more than six months in custody.\n\n\n\nBut soon afterward, Ghanaian authorities changed their minds. The girls were housed in a correctional home for girls in the country's capital, Accra.\n\n\n\nFair Trials International, a UK-based group that provided legal assistance to the pair, called the girls \"pawns in a larger operation.\"\n\n\n\nAuthorities in Ghana had said a man paid the girls \u00a36,000 (about $11,700) to fly to Ghana to retrieve the laptop bags containing the drugs from two of his associates, according to the country's national news agency.\n\n\n\nThose men have not been caught.\n\n\n\n\"The girls have served their full sentences, but the men who groomed them and lured them to Ghana remain free to target other vulnerable young women,\" said Catherine Wolthuizen, Fair Trials' chief executive, in a statement this week.\n\n\n\nGhana and other West African countries have become a transit point for drugs headed to Europe. The girls were arrested in a joint Britain-Ghana drug detection operation, the UK's customs agency said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nCNN's Laura Maestro contributed to this report",

We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Whenever someone at our office bitches about being overworked, our stock response is \"Beats digging ditches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the express intention of the statement is usually not-so-supportive, we think it's a healthy reminder that at the end of the day, we are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wildland firefighters who work for Grayback Forestry in Medford, Oregon, have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches. Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards. Which we do not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis piece was originally produced in August 2010",

  "context": "BURSA, Turkey (CNN) -- Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian Wednesday became the first Armenian head of state to travel to Turkey to attend a soccer game between the two countries' national teams.\n\n\n\nArmenian President Serzh Sarkasian (right) pictured with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul during Gul's visit to Yerevan in 2008.\n\n\n\nSarkisian and Turkish president Abdullah Gul arrived at the stadium in Bursa together in a car flying the national flags of both countries.\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN before the game, Gul said the event opened a new chapter for relations between Armenia and Turkey. But when asked, he avoided saying whether the border between the two neighbors would be opened before 2010.\n\n\n\nAt the match, Turkish supporters vastly outnumbered Armenian fans and gave the Armenian national anthem the standard treatment for most visiting foreign teams -- they booed.\n\n\n\nSmall pockets of Armenian supporters waved the tri-color flag of Armenia.\n\n\n\nTurkey won the World Cup qualifying group game 2-0 but with both countries already unable to progress to the 2010 tournament in South Africa, the significance of the game was in its symbolism.\n\n\n\nThis round of \"football diplomacy,\" comes just days after the two governments signed a historic series of protocols to establish diplomatic relations between the two neighbors.\n\n\n\n\"This is going to be the biggest change in the South Caucasus since 1994,\" said Gevorg Tel-Gabrielyan, the Armenia country director for the Eurasia Partnership Foundation.\n\n\n\nHe was in Bursa on Wednesday, hosting a conference of Armenian and Turkish academics examining bilateral relations. \"If this happens,\" he added, \"its going to change geopolitics in the region.\"\n\n\n\nArmenia and Turkey have been separated by nearly a century of animosity and distrust. The protocols call for establishment of embassies in each others' capitals, and for re-opening the Turkish-Armenian border, which has been closed since 1993.\n\n\n\nThe soccer game was also being held in Bursa, which centuries ago was the capital of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n\nThousands of police were deployed to maintain strict security. On Tuesday, Turkey's prime minister made a public appeal to Turkish football fans, to greet Sarkisian with hospitality and to avoid provocations.\n\n\n\nDespite strong support from the United States, the European Union and Russia, there is considerable opposition among nationalists in Turkey and Armenia to the peace process.\n\n\n\nSarkisian has been met by angry protests both within Armenia and among the influential diaspora communities in the United States, France and Lebanon.\n\n\n\nThousands of protesters in the Armenian capital marched to the country's genocide memorial chanting \"no concessions to the Turks,\" last week.\n\n\n\nArmenia has long demanded that Turkey recognize the World War I-era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turkish soldiers as genocide.\n\n\n\nModern-day Turkey vehemently denies a genocide took place and is calling for an international commission of historical experts to examine these tragic events.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, opposition party leaders in Turkey have criticized the agreement, as has Turkey's close ally in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\nAzerbaijan fought and lost a war against Armenia in the early 1990s. On Sunday, Turkey's prime minister made a fresh call for Armenia to withdraw its troops from the disputed Azerbaijani territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n\n\nFor the new agreement to go into effect, the documents must first be put to a vote in the Turkish and Armenian parliaments. There is no guarantee lawmakers will ratify the agreement.\n\n\n\nThe process of unraveling the complicated network of regional, domestic and historical grievances dividing Armenia and Turkey was jump-started in September of 2008, when Gul traveled to Yerevan to attend a football match between the two national teams.\n\n\n\nThe diplomatic rapprochement has also gotten valuable support from powerful patrons, experts say.\n\n\n\n\"This is one of the few places in the world where Russia and the United States are pulling in the same direction,\" says Hugh Pope, an expert on Turkey with the International Crisis Group. \"Both want to see a more stable Caucasus.\"\n\n\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were both present at the signing ceremony for the Turkish-Armenian agreement in Switzerland on Saturday.\n\n\n\nWednesday's game in Bursa was the final match for the coach of the Turkish national team, Fatih Terim, who announced his resignation after Turkey's most recent football defeat.\n\n\n\nDespite that, the headline in one of Turkey's biggest newspapers billed today's football game \"Our most challenging match.\"",

  "context": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican said Tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nThe Vatican says more Anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nThe process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion.\n\n\n\nThe parishes would be led by former Anglican clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as Catholic priests, said the Rev. James Massa, ecumenical director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n\n\n\"This sets up a process for whole groups of Anglicans -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the Catholic Church while retaining their forms of worship and other Anglican traditions,\" Massa said.\n\n\n\nThe number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships, said Cardinal William Joseph Levada, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\n\n\nTheir talks with the Vatican recently began speeding up, Vatican officials said, leading to Tuesday's announcement.\n\n\n\n\"The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion,\" Levada said.\n\n\n\nLevada said \"hundreds\" of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church. Among them are 50 Anglican bishops, said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship.\n\n\n\nWhile married Anglican priests may be ordained as Catholic priests, the same does not apply to married Anglican bishops, Levada said.\n\n\n\n\"We've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we've not anticipated it happening now,\" Di Noia said. \"The Holy Spirit is at work here.\"\n\n\n\nOne interested group is the Traditional Anglican Communion, an association of churches that is separate from the Anglican Communion and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide. The TAC in 2007 petitioned the Vatican for unity with the Catholic Church with the stipulation that the group retain its Anglican rites.\n\n\n\nThe TAC's primate, Archbishop John Hepworth of Australia, said in a statement Tuesday that the Vatican's announcement \"more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago.\"\n\n\n\nThat is because the Vatican's move involves not only the TAC but other Anglican groups that want to unite with the Catholic Church, said the Right Rev. Daren K. Williams, bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the Anglican Church of America, which is part of the TAC.\n\n\n\nThe Vatican has yet to release all details of the offer, and the TAC's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does, Williams said. But Williams said he believes much of TAC will respond favorably.\n\n\n\nWilliams, who also is rector of All Saints Anglican Church in Fountain Valley, California, said his parishioners have generally been \"very warmly receiving\" Tuesday's announcement.\n\n\n\n\"It is encouraging for them to know their worship experience wouldn't be turned upside down by the Roman Catholic Church,\" Williams said. \"The person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray. We might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office, in addition to praying for our primate.\n\n\n\n\"Really, there'd be very little other difference.\"\n\n\n\nThe parishes retaining the Anglican rites would answer not to Catholic bishops but to regional or nationwide \"personal ordinariates\" who would report to the pope, Massa said. Those officials often will be former Anglican clergy, Vatican officials said.\n\n\n\nThe Church of England said the move ends a \"period of uncertainty\" for Anglican groups who wanted more unity with the Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nBoth groups have a \"substantial overlap in faith, doctrine and spirituality\" and will continue to hold official dialogues, the archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster said in a joint statement.\n\n\n\n\"Those Anglicans who have approached the Holy See have made clear their desire for full, visible unity in the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church,\" Levada said. \"At the same time, they have told us of the importance of their Anglican traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey.\"\n\n\n\nPreserving Anglican traditions, such as mass rites, adds to the diversity of the Catholic Church, he said.\n\n\n\n\"The unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity, as the history of Christianity shows,\" he said. \"Moreover, the many diverse traditions present in the Catholic Church today are all rooted in the principle articulated by St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians: 'There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism.' \"\n\n\n\nCNN's Hada Messia and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

They are not charged in her death.\n\n\n\nSmith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, came just five months after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn, and the sudden death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel, on September 10, 2006.\n\n\n\nFreeman testified that Kapoor faxed to him a list of six drugs that Eroshevich wanted to be sent to the Bahamas, where Eroshevich was treating Smith for anxiety and depression in the days after her son's death.\n\n\n\n\"The more I thought about it, the more concern I had that if she got hold of those medications, it could have fatal consequences\" Freeman said.\n\n\n\nThe pharmacist said the dosages of the drugs were \"not appropriate.\"\n\n\n\nFreeman said he consulted Dr. Greg Thompson, a pharmaceutical expert, who agreed with him and who offered to talk with Eroshevich about the dangers.\n\n\n\nFreeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be \"way out of her league\" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Smith was holed up in her home in the Bahamas mourning her son's death. Her bodyguard said in earlier testimony that the home was under siege by photographers, keeping Smith inside with her windows covered.\n\n\n\nThompson recommended to Eroshevich that she \"forget the paparazzi and get her to a hospital\" if she needed all of those drugs, Freeman said.\n\n\n\nFreeman said the stress of the publicity after Smith's death affected his own health, especially after the celebrity Web site TMZ.com published a copy of the faxed list of medications in question.\n\n\n\nUnder questioning by the defense, Freeman said that over the previous five years he had filled prescriptions for Smith, he never saw any \"red flags\" that she was getting dangerous amounts of drugs.\n\n\n\nCharges against the three defendants also include the use of false names on prescriptions.\n\n\n\nFreeman said he always understood that prescriptions written under the pseudonym \"Michelle Chase\" were intended for Smith. It was a practice begun in 2001, three years before Kapoor or Eroshevich began treating her, to prevent \"trouble for her in terms of her celebrity status,\" Freeman said.\n\n\n\nAfter the preliminary hearing, which could last about three weeks, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry will decide whether a trial will be held.\n\n\n\nIn earlier testimony, Smith's part-time bodyguard Maurice Brighthaupt said \"she just didn't want to deal with life after the death of her son.\"\n\n\n\nBrighthaupt described Smith as \"manipulative\" when she wanted something.\n\n\n\n\"She manipulated Dr. Eroshevich,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEroshevich, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, traveled to the Bahamas five or six times in 2006 to attend to Smith, he said. They had a mother-daughter friendship, not a doctor-patient relationship, Brighthaupt said.\n\n\n\nThe doctor sometimes substituted placebos for the tray full of pills Smith regularly took for her complaints of pain and depression, he said.\n\n\n\n\"She was very concerned that we needed to wean her off the medications,\" Brighthaupt said.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago testified that investigators found 12 prescription drugs, including dangerous opiates, in Smith's hotel room after her death. Seven of them were prescribed using Stern's name, although spelled \"Stearn,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2\u00bd-year inquiry was unsealed last month, revealing many details of the prosecution's case.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao is aiming to deliver a knockout blow to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in the U.S. courts after filing a lawsuit against the American and his connections over claims he used performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, lodged in the Las Vegas district court on Wednesday, names Mayweather, his father Floyd senior, former boxing star Oscar De La Hoya and fellow Golden Boy Promotions executive Richard Schaefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Calling a professional athlete a cheater is the most serious charge one can make,\" the lawsuit says, \"and in today's world, accusing an athlete of using performance-enhancing drugs -- however baseless and lacking in evidence -- is toxic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Filipino fighter, who has won world titles at five different weights, was slated to fight Mayweather on March 13 next year in a money-spinning bout in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he was infuriated by the insistence of Mayweather's camp that he undergo Olympic-style pre-fight blood testing and the alleged implication that he had used illegal drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacquiao posted a Christmas day message on his personal Web site, saying he would take legal action and has now followed through on the threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop lawyer Daniel Petrocelli is representing him and outlined the substance of their case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Manny Pacquiao's achievements come from God-given talent and an indefatigable work ethic -- not steroids,\" he told gathered reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He cannot and will not allow others to deliberately misrepresent his years of hard work and tarnish his reputation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000 dollars and also cites interviews given in various publications that appeared to question the fairness of Pacquiao's pre-fight preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMayweather's connections attempted to diffuse the situation in a statement issued earlier this weak on the Golden Boy Promotions Web site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let it be very clear that nobody from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions is accusing Pacquiao of anything,\" it read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the reality seems to be that for whatever reason Pacquiao does not want to participate in random blood testing, which has already been deemed a harmless procedure that many current athletes are subjected to prior to and during competition,\" it added.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany viewed the war of words between the respective camps as a pre-fight war ploy to boost interest, but the row over dope testing may well have derailed one of the richest fights in boxing history, with huge pay-per-view revenues forecasted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum was pessimistic about a March showdown between the two fighters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is only my opinion, but I don't see the fight happening now,\" he was quoted.\n\n\n\n\n\nPositions are hardening ... Manny's fit to be tied. He's very angry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArum was also reported to have opened negotiations with World Boxing Association super welterweight champion Yuri Foreman to fight Pacquiao.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- When the water of Lake Delton ripped through the highway and drained into the Wisconsin River this week, so did the lifeline for much of the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nBoats sit mired in mud Tuesday after Lake Delton drained into the Wisconsin River the day before.\n\n\n\nLake Delton Village and Wisconsin Dells, the self-professed \"waterpark capital of the world,\" are home to about 5,000 residents. But the area's motels, resorts and vacation homes can accommodate more than 10 times that, according to the visitors bureau.\n\n\n\nInnkeepers, restaurateurs and other business owners were getting ready for the typically bustling tourist season this week when torrential rains sent the 267-acre lake rushing through an embankment propping up Highway A. The manmade lake sucked a 200-foot swath of highway and a half-dozen homes into the Wisconsin with it.\n\n\n\n\"I was on the water when I realized the plug had been pulled,\" said Steve Zowin, who was towing a capsized pontoon boat when he noticed the water level quickly diminishing. \"It drained like a bathtub.\"  Watch a report from the lake \u00bb\n\n\n\nZowin and his wife, Kathy, have owned Lake Delton Watersports for almost three decades. In addition to running a marina, the couple offers parasail rides and rents boats. Personal watercraft and ski boats are their most popular wares, he said.\n\n\n\n\"My gross income will be reduced by about 75 percent, and that's huge,\" he said Wednesday. \"It's a big step backwards for someone who's been in business for 29 years.\"\n\n\n\nZowin, 56, says that most of the tourists hail from metropolises like Chicago, Illinois; St. Paul/Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- all \"within a gas tank of the Dells.\" They start trickling in on Father's Day, and tourism booms between Independence Day and mid-August, he said.\n\n\n\nLike many business owners around Lake Delton, Zowin is seeing canceled reservations from disenchanted visitors who will be spending their summers elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAsked whether visitors were canceling reservations at her lakeside resort, one owner who didn't want to give her name replied, \"Every day, many.\"\n\n\n\nThomas Brown, who owns Port Vista, a popular burger and steak joint on the lake, said that one of his resort-owner friends has refunded $10,000 in deposits for canceled reservations. The friend has closed his resort until at least July, Brown said. iReport.com: Are you near the floods? Send photos, video\n\n\n\nBrown, 49, who has owned the bar and restaurant for 15 years, said business hasn't been hit hard yet.\n\n\n\n\"The first couple of days has been absolutely packed because of all the people coming by to look at the lake and stopping by for a burger or steak,\" he said, adding that he doesn't expect business to boom for long. \"I think when people see what they have to see, it's going to be not so good.\"\n\n\n\nSome business owners who aren't on the lakefront are still trying to gauge what effect the drained lake will have on them.  Watch the rushing lake carry a home away \u00bb\n\n\n\nDel-Bar is a popular seafood and steak restaurant near the lake on Wisconsin Dells Parkway. It's so popular, in fact, that actor Johnny Depp and director Michael Mann recently stopped in during filming of their upcoming movie \"Public Enemies,\" owner Jeff Wimmer said.\n\n\n\nWimmer said his restaurant, which he has owned for 30 years, may be more resilient than lakefront businesses because he relies more on Wisconsin Dells locals. The 66-year-old knows that the summer brings hungry tourists; it's just too early to tell how many of them have been deterred by the dry lake bed.\n\n\n\n\"We're anticipating that it's going to affect us, but it's too early to tell right now,\" Wimmer said.\n\n\n\nHow long the lake will remain dry is also a question. Business owners say, some skeptically, that there are efforts afoot to refill the lake by mid-July.\n\n\n\nDelton Oaks Resort ran a warning on its Web site to potential guests, explaining that there was no timetable for refilling the lake and repairing the highway. But the resort's owners showed they still have a sense of humor.\n\n\n\n\"We at Delton Oaks Resort are 'make lemonade' kind of people, so we will be adding terrific beach volleyball and horseshoe courts in the near future. And, of course, building sand castles on the beach will be big this year,\" the site quipped. \"For all you dog lovers, as soon as the last of the lake bed has dried up, we will have the biggest dog park you've ever seen.\"\n\n\n\nEven if the lake is refilled quickly, business owners like Zowin and Brown fear that the lake's splendid fishing might not make a rapid rebound.\n\n\n\nThe lake was home to white and largemouth bass, walleye, crappie, bluegill and perch, but those fish are now in the Wisconsin River after their habitat burst through the Highway A embankment.\n\n\n\n\"Fishing might be gone for the next four or five years,\" Brown predicted.\n\n\n\nBusiness owners around Lake Delton say they hope to bounce back sooner, perhaps by next summer, but this summer may be a wash.\n\n\n\n\"Once in a while, the more serious ramifications -- mostly financial -- they hit me, and I'm flooded with a few emotions,\" Zowin said. \"It's going to hurt, but I'll survive.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom should leave office during the investigation into whether he was connected to three recent slayings, his 2007 presidential opponent said Thursday.\n\n\n\nGuatemalan President Alvaro Colom has said he has no intention of giving up power over the slayings inquiry.\n\n\n\nRetired Gen. Otto Perez Molina, who lost to Colom in a runoff, said Guatemala is suffering its worst crisis since the democratic process began in 1985 after years of civil war. Demonstrations will continue and anger will mount unless Colom temporarily steps out of the way to allow an unblemished probe, he said.\n\n\n\n\"We want an impartial investigation, a transparent investigation,\" Perez told CNN. \"The president must leave his post.\"\n\n\n\nThe crisis started Monday with the surfacing of a video in which Guatemalan attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg said Colom, the president's wife and a top aide would be responsible if something happened to the lawyer. Rosenberg was gunned down Sunday while riding his bike in Guatemala City. He had recorded the video last week.\n\n\n\nRosenberg was being threatened with death, he said, because he had blamed Colom and his associates for the April slayings of a prominent businessman and his daughter. Rosenberg had represented the businessman.\n\n\n\nThey were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted.\n\n\n\n\"It's the time-honored tradition in Guatemala that if someone gets in your way, there's likely to be a violent outcome,\" said Donald J. Planty, the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala from 1996 to 1999.\n\n\n\nColom took to the airwaves Monday night to vehemently deny that he, his wife or the aide had any connection to the slayings.\n\n\n\nHe promised a full investigation and said he would accept international help, asking the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to become involved. A Guatemalan newspaper reported Thursday that an FBI agent had arrived in the country in connection with the investigation.\n\n\n\nBut Rosenberg supporters say they don't believe the Guatemalan government can carry out an impartial and thorough investigation and want Colom out. Perez said Vice President Jose Rafael Espada could take over until the investigation is complete.\n\n\n\n\"We are only asking that the state be strengthened,\" Perez said. \"If he doesn't do this, we believe the situation will get worse.\"\n\n\n\nColom said in an interview Tuesday night with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that he has no intention of resigning or otherwise giving up power. He blamed the deaths on unnamed people who want to bring down his government.\n\n\n\n\"It is evident that [Rosenberg's video statement] was written by someone who has been in on this plan to destabilize the government and for reasons that I don't know, because I don't know why Mr. Rosenberg mentions us in that video,\" Colom said.\n\n\n\nFor Perez and other critics, that's not good enough.\n\n\n\n\"The president has not wanted to confront this and has given evasive answers,\" Perez said. \"Until the president confronts this, indignation will increase.\"\n\n\n\nSome analysts say Colom needs to get the nation under control immediately.\n\n\n\n\"It's a very worrisome situation,\" said Planty, the former U.S. ambassador. \"The country is in very serious trouble.\"\n\n\n\nThere were rumors two to three weeks ago that the military might stage a coup, Planty said.\n\n\n\n\"The security situation is out of control,\" he added.\n\n\n\nHeather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, calls it \"a major political scandal.\"\n\n\n\nLarry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, agrees with that assessment.\n\n\n\n\"It's very damning for the president. Very damning,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFernando Carrera Castro, a fiscal analyst and executive director of the Instituto Centroamericano de Estudios Fiscales, said the upheaval could further tear apart a poverty-ridden nation trying to heal from a deadly civil war.\n\n\n\nThe three recently slain Guatemalans -- Rosenberg, businessman Khalil Musa and his daughter -- came from the upper economic class. As a result, Carrera said, many wealthy Guatemalans are being \"radicalized\" against the government.\n\n\n\nLikewise, he said, many poor and disenfranchised Guatemalans also are becoming radicalized and are rallying behind Colom and the government.\n\n\n\n\"I fear that this crisis will lead to violence and destabilization of the government,\" Carrera said from Guatemala City. \"We all want justice. That is clear.\"\n\n\n\nJuan Tornoe, a Guatemalan who has lived in the United States for seven years, rejects what he says are efforts to forge a class divide.\n\n\n\n\"The powers that be are trying to make it a social issue -- the wealthy against the poor,\" he said. \"This is not a social issue. This is Guatemalans are fed up.\"\n\n\n\nTornoe has personal connections with some of the key actors in the crisis. Rosenberg was his wife's law professor at La Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Tornoe said.\n\n\n\nAnd he said he went to high school with Gustavo Alejos, the presidential aide Rosenberg mentioned in the video.\n\n\n\nIn his conversations with friends in Guatemala, Tornoe said, he sensed \"a sense of desperation, of hopelessness.\"\n\n\n\nHe believes people are fed up.\n\n\n\n\"They're saying, 'OK. Let's do something. Let's not let this happen again and again and again,' \" he said.\n\n\n\nCarrera, the fiscal analyst, holds out hope. The investigation, he said, will be handled by an independent attorney general who does not report to the president. And the probe will be conducted under the watchful eye of a U.N.-Guatemalan commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence.\n\n\n\n\"That gives me more confidence,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBut Perez and others note that the attorney general, Jose Amilcar Velasquez Zarate, met privately with Colom on Tuesday morning, the day after the scandal broke. The meeting was not disclosed until reporters uncovered it and questioned Velasquez on his way out.\n\n\n\nColom's critics accuse the president of already meddling in the investigation.\n\n\n\nColom and Velasquez said the meeting had been planned days ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\"There is no interference in the investigation,\" Velasquez told reporters afterward.\n\n\n\nGuatemala has \"a culture of corruption,\" said Planty, the former U.S. envoy. A just investigation is necessary, he said.\n\n\n\n\"Until they fix it, they will limp along -- and that's the good scenario,\" he said. \"They are in serious danger of becoming a failed state, if they're not already. There is complete impunity. Nobody is punished for anything.\"\n\n\n\nRosenberg said the same thing in the video, bemoaning the \"narcos, assassins and thieves\" who have taken over the country.\n\n\n\n\"Those thieves are sinking all of Guatemala,\" he said. \"They kill people like dogs.\"\n\n\n\nThe lawyer's niece, Mariela Rosenberg, said her uncle learned to accept his fate.\n\n\n\n\"He had many threats,\" she told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, \"and when he saw it was inevitable, he taped a video.\"\n\n\n\nRadio journalist Mario David Garcia told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that Rosenberg was supposed to detail his allegations Monday afternoon on Garcia's program, \"Hablando Claro\" (Speaking Clearly).\n\n\n\nInstead, his funeral was held that day.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- California voters on Tuesday appear to have approved Proposition 8, a measure banning same-sex marriage in the state.\n\n\n\nCNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin says the U.S. Supreme Court may have to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nCalifornia's secretary of state late Tuesday released semi-official results showing Proposition 8 had passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent. CNN has not officially called the result one way or the other.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday protesters took to the streets of Los Angeles to voice their opposition to the potential ban. And there are at least three legal challenges to it now pending in court.\n\n\n\nKiran Chetry of CNN's \"American Morning\" spoke Thursday with the program's legal analyst, Sunny Hostin, about the issue.\n\n\n\nChetry: California's attorney general says that the constitutional amendment is not retroactive, and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom says he will continue to marry people until someone sues him to stop. So what does Prop 8 mean first of all to people who want to get married in the state of California?\n\n\n\nHostin: Well, we already know in Los Angeles they are no longer issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. So in Los Angeles, it's a no go. In San Francisco, as you mentioned, the mayor is saying, \"We're still going to be doing it.\" So for people that aren't married yet, it's really legal limbo.\n\n\n\nChetry: All right. And what about people who from the time that they allowed same-sex marriage, this was in May until November, some 18,000 couples decided they were going to do it. What happens to them? Is their marriage still valid?\n\n\n\nHostin: It's still valid right now. But really they are also in a legal limbo. The bottom line it's all over the place. The law is really unclear here.\n\n\n\nLast night, I was poring over these legal papers. I was also discussing this with a lot of law professors, a lot of different lawyers, and everyone is all over the place. Some folks said, you know, the bottom line is when you look at the language of Proposition 8, it is very clear that it was meant to be retroactive and that means that all the marriages will be invalidated.\n\n\n\nThen another law professor that I spoke to said that is absolutely fundamentally ridiculous. The bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples and this is a right that is not going to be given away. I think we're going to see a lot of litigation here, Kiran, and the bottom line is everyone is in a legal, legal limbo.\n\n\n\nChetry: It's very interesting the grounds for which they are challenging. At least in one of these lawsuits they said that it was a constitutional revision rather than an amendment. And that means it would need two-thirds approval of the House in the legislature. So do we think it could go to the state house in California as well as being fought in the courts?\n\n\n\nHostin: I really think this is going to be a legal issue. I think this is going to go before the California Supreme Court. And we already know as you mentioned  that there are three cases pending before the California Supreme Court. And what is interesting to note is that it's the very same court that allowed these marriages in the first place.\n\n\n\nAnd so, my guess is that that court is going to weigh in, probably reinstitute the right to marry for same-sex couples and then that's going to be likely based on the U.S. Constitution and our Supreme Court is going to weigh in.\n\n\n\nWhat is I think extremely interesting here is that we now know that we have a president-elect, Obama. He's going to get the opportunity likely to appoint Supreme Court justices. So we don't even know which type of court or the makeup of the court that will hear this. But I think the Supreme Court will likely weigh in on this issue.\n\n\n\nChetry: This was such a hot button issue in the state. More spending on either side, $35 million, $37 million on both sides.\n\n\n\nHostin: Yes.\n\n\n\nChetry: It was the highest funded campaign on any state ballot.\n\n\n\nHostin: That's right.\n\n\n\nChetry: They say it trumped every other campaign except the presidential.\n\n\n\nHostin: People care about this issue. I mean, they're talking about discrimination, equal protection. It's an issue that's a hotbed issue.\n\n\n\nWe also know, Kiran, that in Arizona and Florida that this ban was implemented. And so, you know, it's all over the place. People care about this issue, and this is an issue that is really present. And I think that it's something that, we, of course, have to watch because we're talking about equal protection, we're talking about discrimination. People care about these issues.\n\n\n\nChetry: Sunny Hostin, great to see you. Thank you.\n\n\n\nHostin: Thanks. iReport.com: Did you vote on a same-sex measure?",

  "context": "Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Deborah Bradley appeared calm and joyful just hours before her baby daughter was reported missing, according to a supermarket clerk who sold her baby wipes, baby food and boxed wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She had a smile on her face, like she always does when she comes in here,\" said clerk Rebecca Guerrero, whom FBI agents interviewed Saturday about conversations she'd had with Bradley.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance video recorded at a grocery store on October 3 shows Bradley and a man purchasing the items from Guerrero the day before 11-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice, who were joined in their search effort by federal authorities last week, have said they have no suspects or solid leads in Lisa's disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Guerrero described the FBI agents' questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They pretty much asked me if she was depressed, ... how she acted around the baby, if she seemed stressed out,\" Guerrero said. \"I told them she never looked depressed around me. You know, she always seemed to have a smile on her face when her kids were around.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley and the girl's father, Jeremy Irwin, are friendly people who were thrilled to have a baby daughter, Guerrero said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they're here, they're happy. They're smiling. They love their kids,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter two years chatting with Bradley in the checkout line at Festival Foods in Kansas City, Missouri, Guerrero said she had learned a lot about the family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would just pretty much talk about what they've been doing, stuff like that; the children, her two sons, and then when she found out she was pregnant with Lisa, that's all we talked about,\" Guerrero said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe supermarket clerk said she also told FBI agents Lisa's parents never mentioned anyone wanting to harm them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From my interaction (with the parents), I really don't think that they have anything to do with this,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities had expressed frustration recently after Lisa's parents had stopped cooperating with investigators, police Capt. Steve Young said. However, a family spokeswoman for Bradley and father Jeremy Irwin attributed the frustration to \"miscommunication,\" and a subsequent meeting with the parents was held Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Irwin's family announced they had brought in a prominent private investigator to help with the search -- a high-profile twist in a case that has gripped national headlines.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlanked by family members wearing T-shirts with a picture of Lisa and the word \"Kidnapped\" above it, investigator Bill Stanton said Tuesday night that he wants a \"happy ending\" to the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told CNN a family friend was paying for his services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I will be asking questions,\" he added. \"I am here to seek the truth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStanton is a former New York City police officer who has served as a security consultant for several television networks. He said his role is to help \"coordinate and focus the family\" in both the investigation and in its dealings with the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are here to cooperate with anyone and everyone that will help us find the guilty party and return Lisa home safely,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStanton said the family, which remains united and strong despite the \"tremendous hardship,\" will release more information soon. He did not elaborate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know everybody's watching this family and watching this house, and that's fair,\" he said. \"Keep one eye on them, but also keep the other eye out on the streets, in every place. Because there is a bad guy out there, or bad people, with this child. And we want to get this child home safe and sound.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa was last seen around 10:30 p.m. October 3, asleep in her crib, police said. Authorities were called to the home about 4 a.m. October 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe turned 11 months old Tuesday, the eighth day of the search.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities focused on an abandoned home about a half mile from the Irwin home, and included an inspection of a well in the backyard of the property.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search did not yield any evidence, police said. Authorities had previously combed a nearby landfill and creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It appears the suspect entered/exited through a bedroom window,\" authorities said in a statement. \"Evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, told reporters that he discovered the girl was missing when he got home from work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The front door was unlocked,\" he said last week. \"Most of the lights were on in the house, and the window in front was open -- all very unusual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThree cell phones were also reported missing at the home, Young said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, police said. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe missing girl has two bottom teeth and a \"beauty mark\" on her right outer thigh. She had a cold with a cough, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Bill Kirkos and Karan Olson contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama blasted Congress for not passing a financial rescue package Monday, while Sen. John McCain's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of putting \"politics ahead of country.\"\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives rejected a $700 billion plan to bail out the financial system, putting a roadblock in front of the largest government intervention in the market since the Great Depression.\n\n\n\nThe bill failed by a vote of 205 to 228, with 140 Democrats and 65 Republicans voting in favor and 95 Democrats joining 133 Republicans against.\n\n\n\n\"This is a moment of national crisis, and today's inaction in Congress as well as the angry and hyper-partisan statement released by the McCain campaign are exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington,\" the Obama-Biden campaign said in a statement released shortly after the vote.\n\n\n\nThe statement went on to say that every American \"should be outraged that an era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and Washington has led us to this point.\"  Watch more on the vote \u00bb\n\n\n\nAlso after the vote, McCain touted his role in last week's negotiations on the bailout bill.\n\n\n\n\"I laid out principles\" including \"responsible oversight,\" transparency and a cap on so-called golden parachutes --the big bonuses Wall Street CEOs would receive despite their involvement in the economic crisis, he said from Des Moines, Iowa. \"I worked hard to play a constructive role.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he was satisfied with the way the bill was written, though \"it wasn't perfect.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier, McCain's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of injecting politics into the American economy.\n\n\n\n\"From the minute John McCain suspended his campaign and arrived in Washington to address this crisis, he was attacked by the Democratic leadership: Sens. Obama and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid, Speaker Pelosi and others.\n\n\n\n\"Their partisan attacks were an effort to gain political advantage during a national economic crisis. By doing so, they put at risk the homes, livelihoods and savings of millions of American families,\" Doug Holtz-Eakin, a senior policy adviser for McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"Barack Obama failed to lead, phoned it in, attacked John McCain and refused to even say if he supported the final bill. ... This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country,\" Holtz-Eakin said.\n\n\n\nRepublicans and Democrats blamed each other for the failure of the bill, which President Bush had urged Congress to approve.\n\n\n\nObama had earlier Monday spoken with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and congressional leaders.  Watch Pelosi say Democrats 'delivered' \u00bb\n\n\n\nMcCain and Obama had both said Sunday that they would probably vote for the legislation, as long as it included some key principles they had pushed for.\n\n\n\nMcCain announced last week he was \"suspending\" his campaign events to focus on the financial crisis, but Democrats accused him of pulling a political stunt. iReport.com: Do you support a Wall Street bailout?\n\n\n\nThe economy has dominated the campaign trail this month, and both candidates have been trying to convince voters that they will do a better job of getting the financial crisis under control.\n\n\n\nEarlier Monday, McCain told voters that Obama isn't being honest about his tax votes and said the Democrat is \"always cheering for higher taxes.\" iReport.com: Share your stories from the campaign trail\n\n\n\nIn response, the Obama campaign called McCain's remarks \"false attacks\" and an \"angry diatribe.\"\n\n\n\n\"Two times, on March 14, 2008, and June 4, 2008, in the Democratic budget resolution, he voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000 per year. He even said at the time that this vote for higher taxes on the middle class was 'getting our nation's priorities back on track,' \" McCain said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\"Then something amazing happened: On Friday night, he looked the American people in the eye and said it never happened. My friends, we need a president who will always tell the American people the truth,\" McCain said.\n\n\n\nMcCain said a vote for Obama would \"guarantee higher taxes, fewer jobs and an even bigger federal government\" and charged that \"these policies will deepen our recession.\"  Watch McCain slam Obama on spending \u00bb\n\n\n\nShortly after McCain finished his speech, the Obama campaign accused the Arizona senator of lying.\n\n\n\n\"Sen. McCain's angry diatribe today won't make up for his erratic response to the greatest financial crisis of our time. John McCain knows that the budget he's talking about didn't end up raising taxes on a single American, and the lie he told the American people today is all the more outrageous a day after he admitted that his health care plan will increase taxes on some families,\" Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor said.\n\n\n\nIn McCain's speech, the Republican presidential candidate was referring to votes on a resolution (Senate Concurrent Resolution 70) meant to outline the Senate's budget priorities through 2013, but the measure had no practical effect.\n\n\n\nAccording to a CNN review of the resolution, it assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts pushed by President Bush will expire in that time, which McCain says amounts to a tax increase. Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, voted \"yes\" on the resolution. McCain did not vote.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Democrats offered their own cuts in the 48-page resolution, which called for several tax cuts and breaks, including rolling back the alternative-minimum tax and the so-called \"marriage penalty.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center, the tax plan Obama has proposed during the campaign would increase taxes in 2009 on the wealthiest 20 percent of households, while offering tax cuts for the other 80 percent.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as Obama and McCain continue campaigning this week, their running mates will be focused on their upcoming debate. Palin and Biden face off Thursday in St. Louis, Missouri, in the only vice presidential debate of the election season.\n\n\n\nAfter McCain's rally, Palin headed to McCain's ranch near Sedona, Arizona, for what a top aide calls \"debate camp.\"\n\n\n\nPalin has already spent four days hunkered down in a Philadelphia hotel for debate prep with advisers.\n\n\n\nBiden was preparing for the debate in Delaware on Monday.\n\n\n\nCNN's Dana Bash and Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Melissa Harris-Lacewell is associate professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton University. She is the author of the award-winning book \"Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political Thought\" and writes a daily blog titled The Kitchen Table.\n\n\n\nMelissa Harris-Lacewell says African-Americans remain skeptical about racial progress in the U.S.\n\n\n\nPRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- America was proud of itself for electing Barack Obama. The pride was not just partisan and ideological; it was also specifically and clearly racial.\n\n\n\nThe morning after Obama's win, The New York Times declared \"Racial Barrier Falls in Decisive Victory.\" The Los Angeles Times asserted that \"for the first time in human history, a largely white nation has elected a black man to be its paramount leader.\"\n\n\n\nSome black commentators openly wept on election night, thrilled with witnessing the election of our first black president. Even Sen. John McCain, conceding defeat, pointed to the greatness of the American promise fulfilled in the election of his opponent. Obama's victory offered the possibility that the scars of America's racial legacy were healed or, at least, that they were less raw.\n\n\n\nFor many African-American citizens, the election of the first black U.S. president was cause for celebration and open-mouthed wonder about an outcome that seemed so unlikely just two years earlier, when Obama announced his bid.\n\n\n\nDespite this joy, many black citizens were dubious that his victory represented the destruction of any particular racial barrier.\n\n\n\nAfrican-Americans were both proud of and excited about Obama, but in the 45 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, black Americans had seen doors to power, influence and wealth open just enough to admit just a few without fundamentally altering opportunities for the majority.\n\n\n\nIndeed, responses to a recent CNN/Essence Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. survey indicate that black enthusiasm about Obama exists side-by-by side with deep skepticism about America's racial progress.\n\n\n\nThis atmosphere of both enthusiasm and doubt has sparked discussion about whether we have entered a post-racial era in American politics.\n\n\n\nIt is a difficult debate, because the term \"post-racial\" is not clearly defined. Race itself is a slippery idea. Typically, we treat race like a fixed, unchanging, biological category. But race is none of these things.\n\n\n\nRace is a social construct. Though it is based in physical traits, race is a category developed through social practice, law and history. As a nation, we made blackness through our politics, developing a category of people who could be enslaved and later segregated.\n\n\n\nSo when we talk of a post-racial America, we are not pointing to the massive demographic shifts that are unalterably changing the racial, ethnic and linguistic landscape of America. Instead, \"post-racial\" is an expression of social and political longing.\n\n\n\nFor most, this means an America free of racism and discrimination, but others seem to hint at a society entirely free of racial identity or recognition.\n\n\n\nThe idea of a post-racial America has been upheld as an achievable ideal where people would receive equal treatment and fair outcomes regardless of their race.\n\n\n\nIt has been critiqued as an impossible dream unlikely to exist in a nation with a history of slavery and legal discrimination.\n\n\n\nIt has been denounced as an unworthy goal that would require black Americans to reject their cultural specificity and unique social and political concerns.\n\n\n\nUndoubtedly, the 2008 election broke formerly entrenched racial trends. Obama was elected just as the depth and breadth of the American economic crisis was becoming clear. Some suggested that his victory could be explained by the nation's fiscal difficulties because he was the candidate of the out-party, which often wins when times are hard. But this analysis forgets the cross-cutting history of race.\n\n\n\nWhen the economic pie shrinks, Americans rarely form multiracial political coalitions led by minority candidates. Obama's victory countered the trend toward racial balkanization more typical in tough economic times.\n\n\n\nThe changing dynamics of racial politics were further evidenced when Obama won both Virginia and North Carolina. In these Southern states and in many blue states throughout the country, Obama shattered the \"Bradley Effect,\" often getting a higher percentage of the white vote than polls predicted. There was little evidence that white voters rejected Obama based on his race, and few white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for McCain.\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, Obama's win offers evidence of a post-racial American electoral politics. And if not post-racial, these data at least point to a much less racist American voting public than what existed 40 years ago.\n\n\n\nStill, the election of a black president has not changed the material realities of racial inequality. African-Americans are significantly more distressed than their white counterparts on every meaningful economic indicator: income, unemployment, wealth, education, home ownership and home foreclosures.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American social realities are equally grim. Blacks are far more likely to be arrested and more harshly sentenced than whites. African-Americans are less likely to marry, more likely to divorce and more likely to live in single- parent households. Compared with whites, blacks are more likely to suffer infant mortality, cancer, diabetes and premature death.\n\n\n\nSubstantial evidence shows that the economic, social and even political gains made by African-Americans in the 1960s and 1970s have leveled off or reversed in the past decade in areas such as urban education, the number of black elected officials and the racial wealth gap. The murder of a security guard at the national Holocaust museum by a racist anti-Semite reminded the nation that old-fashioned, violent bigotry still has life in America.\n\n\n\nThese sobering realities indicate that race still vastly over-determines the life chances of Americans. These differences cannot be explained away by class alone, because most of these inequalities persist even when controlling for income. To be born black in America is still a tremendous disadvantage compared with being born white in this country.\n\n\n\nHerein lies the challenge facing Americans in this new racial era. For much of the 20th century, the battle for civil rights rested on a belief that political equality would translate into social and economic justice. There can be little doubt that many of the substantive battles for political power and representation have been won. In that sense, Obama's election is the fulfillment of a post-racial political promise.\n\n\n\nIt is equally clear that this political arrival has not ushered in the other substantive racial changes that the civil rights movement hoped to achieve. In many ways, political equality is just the beginning of the process. The work of politics is to collectively craft the nation we want to have. The election of Obama does not indicate the realization of post-racial America, but it does allow us the opportunity to engage in renewed, collective questioning of what a racially just nation is like.\n\n\n\nHaving achieved so much politically, there is still real debate about how to end overt racism, structural discrimination and persistent inequality. Some want a country where the black kids don't sit together in the cafeteria, while others hope black kids being together will provoke neither comment nor anxiety.\n\n\n\nSome want a nation where no one notices race, while others hope that their racial identity can be both recognized and appreciated. Some worry that eliminating racial barriers will only solidify economic differences, while others suspect that economic justice cannot be achieved without grappling with race. Some want the end of all inequality, while others simply hope disparities will be based on \"merit\" rather than race.\n\n\n\nAs citizens in a democracy, we can choose the future of our racial politics. Not all at once and not without struggle, but we can make new choices\n\n\n\nAnd this time, African-Americans participate in the process of remaking America's racial story from a very different position than we have occupied in the past. Rather than being solely on the margins of national power, black Americans, through the person of Obama, have achieved a new kind of citizenship more empowered to recreate American race.\n\n\n\nThis does not mean black people have equal political or economic power, but it does mean that the election of Obama encourages black Americans to even more loudly and clearly articulate our varied aspirations for our country.\n\n\n\nIn November, we did a marvelous thing. Now, the work begins.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Harris-Lacewell.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Transportation investigators Wednesday discovered \"anomalies\" in an essential control circuit of a track where a fatal crash between two Washington subway trains killed nine people.\n\n\n\nInvestigators work Tuesday at the site of the Metro train crash in Washington.\n\n\n\nEach section of the transit system's track contains a circuit that transmits and receives signals that generate speed commands for trains, said Debbie Hersman of the National Transportation Safety Board. She said the circuits are \"vital providing information to the operators and the train itself when on automatic.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators found no problems in five of the six circuits on the stretch of track in the crash area. But they found \"anomalies\" with the sixth circuit, Hersman said.\n\n\n\nShe would not say what those anomalies were but said simulated crash tests would be conducted to try and determine what caused the deadly accident.\n\n\n\nThe findings could mean that the striking train, which was on automatic, did not know to slow down because another train was stopped on the track ahead.\n\n\n\nHersman said investigators walked the tracks Wednesday, finding markings on the track that indicated emergency braking had taken place.\n\n\n\nInvestigators hoped Thursday to interview the operator of the struck train, who was released from a hospital Wednesday. The driver of the striking train was killed.\n\n\n\nThe crash, the worst in the history of Washington's transit system, known as the Metro, occurred along the congested Red Line just before 5 p.m. Monday on an above-ground track section near Takoma Park, Maryland.\n\n\n\nBoth cars were on the same track, traveling in the same direction -- southward from Fort Totten Metrorail station to the Shady Grove station. The struck train had stopped behind another train undergoing service and was awaiting directions to move ahead.\n\n\n\nThe striking train was pulling some of the oldest cars in the fleet of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. On Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he plans to seek $3 billion for Metro transit capital improvements, some of which would likely be spent to replace some those old Series 1000 cars, purchased between 1974 and 1978.\n\n\n\nUpon impact, the train pulling those Series 1000 cars jumped on top of the other train. All the fatalities were on the striking train, Train 112, Metro transit spokeswoman Angela Gates told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIn the collision, the front car of the striking train was severely damaged, leaving minimal space for survivability, said Hersman. According to one report, 50 feet of the 75-foot length of that lead car were lost to the accident, leaving only one-third of the space after the crushing impact.  Watch Hersman talk about previous warnings \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe NTSB recommended in 2006 that Metro transit replace or retrofit all of its Series 1000 trains, to bring them up to current safety standards.\n\n\n\nMetro transit responded that because it was constrained by tax-advantage leases, it intended to keep the 1000 Series until the end of 2014.\n\n\n\n\"Our recommendation was not addressed, so it [the case] has been closed in an unacceptable status,\" Hersman said.\n\n\n\nThe NTSB has no regulatory powers and can't force implementation.  Watch Hersman talk about the computer systems \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"The safety of our citizens is our highest priority and we must take every precaution that this loss of life does not occur again,\" said Hoyer, a Democratic congressman from Maryland.\n\n\n\nHe said he would soon introduce a final measure to authorize dedicated federal and local funding for Metro.\n\n\n\nThe Series 1000 cars comprise a quarter of Metro transit's 1,126 cars, or nearly 300 cars, Gates said.\n\n\n\nAt $3 million per car, the agency can't afford to replace them all at once, Gates said. Each car has a 40-year life and can last until fiscal year 2015, she added.\n\n\n\n\"So we've taken steps to keep them in good condition.\"\n\n\n\nShe said they have been phasing out the outdated cars as new cars are bought, she said. That plan hasn't gone as quickly as anticipated, however, because of an increase in ridership, Gates added.\n\n\n\nThe lead train in Monday's crash contained newer 5000-Series and 3000-Series cars. These have data recorders, which will aid the investigation a great deal if they aren't damaged, Hersman said. The recorders provide information on such things as speed, braking and emergency applications. She said there were no recorders on the rear train.\n\n\n\nThe rear train was being operated in automatic mode, which is the normal operating procedure during rush hour. Washington transit trains are being operated manually until the cause of the crash is determined, Hersman said.\n\n\n\nShe said there is no indication that any of the brakes on the rear train failed before it rear-ended the other train.\n\n\n\n\"Our investigators on scene yesterday did find some evidence of emergency brake application. They found the emergency mushroom, which is a button that was depressed in the control cab, and they also examined the wheels and the brakes, and they found that the rotors showed some bluing,\" Hersman said.\n\n\n\n\"That bluing is consistent with an emergency brake application,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBluing indicates the rotors have been subjected to extremely high temperatures, and this can be caused by hard stops.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A California man sold his 14-year-old daughter to an 18-year-old man for cash, beer and meat -- then called police when the prospective bridegroom didn't live up to his end of the deal, authorities said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcelino de Jesus Martinez faces felony charges, according to police in Greenfield, California.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcelino de Jesus Martinez, 36, of Greenfield, California, was arrested Monday and booked into the Monterey County Jail, Greenfield police said in a statement. He faces felony charges of receiving money for causing a person to cohabitate, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartinez had arranged through a third party to have his daughter marry the older teenager, identified by authorities as Margarito de Jesus Galindo, of Gonzales, California. In exchange, Galindo was to pay Martinez $16,000 and provide him with 160 cases of beer, 100 cases of soda, 50 cases of Gatorade, two cases of wine, and six cases of meat, Greenfield Police Chief Joe Grebmeier told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll those involved in the case are from the western Mexican state of Oaxaca, the police chief said. In the Oaxacan community, such an agreement is \"normal and honorable,\" he said. \"In California, it's against the law.\"  Watch for a list of the groceries dad reportedly wanted \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Oaxacan culture, the food and beverages are provided by a prospective bridegroom for the wedding, Grebmeier said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities believe the young girl went with Galindo willingly, and no coercion was involved, he said. However, the girl is four years younger than California's age of consent, although the law does allow 16-year-olds to marry with parental consent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The 14-year-old juvenile moved in with Galindo and when payments were not received, the father, Martinez, called Greenfield PD to bring back the daughter,\" according to a written police statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girl was reported as a runaway juvenile on December 18, Grebmeier said, and police took a missing-persons report and put out a flier.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut \"as we investigated, it started to develop into something that may not have been a runaway,\" he said, and police began to believe Martinez wanted them to bring back his daughter, since he had received no payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 2, Galindo and the girl returned from a trip to Soledad, a town a few miles north of Greenfield, and were interviewed. Police learned the couple had never married, but had engaged in sexual relations, Grebmeier said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalindo and Martinez were neighbors at an apartment complex and were apparently from the same area in Mexico, the police chief said. A third party was brokering the marriage deal, he said, and is cooperating with authorities. But the young couple apparently left for Soledad before the negotiations were complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartinez was arrested Sunday after undergoing additional questioning by police, Grebmeier said. He remained jailed Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalindo was cited for statutory rape and released, Grebmeier said. The girl was returned to her family, he said, as authorities believe she is in no danger. However, police reported the case to child protection officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greenfield area has had a large influx of Oaxacans. A presentation on understanding Oaxacan culture is posted on the Greenfield police Web site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Arranged marriages are common in several cultures, and this is not an issue among consenting adults over the age of 18,\" police said in the statement. \"But California has several laws regarding minors, the age of consent and human trafficking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice are trying to be culturally sensitive, Grebmeier told CNN, but \"when I'm in Mexico, I have to respect Mexican laws. When you're in the United States, you have to respect United States laws. That's the bottom line.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he wanted to send a message to immigrant communities that such behavior is unacceptable. He said his department has long heard rumors of children as young as 12 being sold or offered for sale. The Greenfield police statement said arranged marriages between young girls and older men \"have become a local problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenfield is about 140 miles southeast of San Francisco.",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Bone-dry conditions in an area that has not seen a major fire in more than 60 years pushed a Southern California wildfire from 45,000 acres to more than 100,000 acres in a matter of hours Monday, fire officials said.\n\n\n\nA charred fire truck sits at the bottom of a hill Monday near Acton, California. Two firefighters died in the vehicle.\n\n\n\nThe Station fire, burning in Angeles National Forest north of Los Angeles, has forced thousands of evacuations and threatened thousands of structures -- including major communications installations on Mount Wilson, said Mike Dietrich, the U.S. Forest Service's incident commander.\n\n\n\n\"This is a very difficult firefight,\" Dietrich said. \"This is a very angry fire that we're fighting right now. Until we can get a change in weather conditions, I'm not overly optimist.\"\n\n\n\nWeather forecasts show little change in conditions for the next four to five days.\n\n\n\nThe fire, which has sent plumes of thick smoke spiraling as much as 20,000 feet into the air, is creating its own wind patterns, making it unpredictable, officials said.  See images of the wildfire \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"This fire is headed just about anywhere it wants to right now,\" said Dietrich, who earlier said the blaze had \"a mind of its own.\"\n\n\n\nFire officials said Monday they had issued evacuation notices for residents of the 10,000 homes under threat. Nearly 100 homes were added to the notices Monday afternoon.\n\n\n\nBut six people in the evacuation area had refused repeated requests to leave, said Commander David Fender, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's incident commander.\n\n\n\n\"There's six individuals, they're up there, they've been asked to leave three times,\" Fender said. \"They refuse to leave. That's their choice.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier reports indicated the six were trapped at their Gold Canyon ranch and firefighters were unable to reach them, but Fender said he had no indication that was true.\n\n\n\n\"They've all shared that they do not want to leave,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe fire claimed the lives of two firefighters Sunday. Capt. Tedmund Hall, 47, and Specialist Arnaldo Quinones, 35, were killed when their vehicle went down a steep, 700-foot embankment, Dietrich said.\n\n\n\nHall was with the department for 26 years and Quinones for eight years.  Watch a fire official give details on the \"tragic\" accident \u00bb\n\n\n\nDietrich said the blaze had destroyed two communications arrays in the area but had not flared up on Mount Wilson, home to 20 television and radio transmission towers, fire and police communications equipment and the Mount Wilson Observatory.\n\n\n\nThat area is under a critical threat and a strike team is in position to protect the observatory. But, Dietrich stressed, \"My No. 1 priority is our firefighters' safety.\"\n\n\n\n\"If they have to abandon the position, there's no facility that is worth a human life,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDespite the difficulties, Dietrich told reporters that firefighting teams \"will not rest until it's out.\" And Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Bryant noted that \"there have been hundreds of homes saved by firefighters in this effort.\"\n\n\n\nThe Station fire was the largest of eight blazes burning across the state on Monday, officials said.  Watch iReporters' footage of the wildfire \u00bb\n\n\n\nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Monday his administration is \"working around the clock to ensure that our brave men and women working on the fires' front lines have the resources needed to respond and beat back these fires as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\"We have the toughest and best-trained firefighters in the world fighting to protect public safety and property,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"I am confident in the state's response as these fires continue to burn throughout California.\"\n\n\n\nThe governor on Monday toured damage left in the wake of the 49 Fire in Placer County, in northern California. As of Monday, the fire had burned 275 acres and was 50 percent contained. On Sunday, the governor expressed his condolences for the loss of the firefighters in the Station fire.  Learn more about areas under threat \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe Station fire started Wednesday and had destroyed 18 structures by Sunday. At least 10,000 homes, 500 businesses and 2,000 other structures are threatened by the fire, which exploded in size over the weekend, fueled by low humidity and high temperatures. Evacuations have been ordered for an unspecified number of residents.\n\n\n\nOne of them was Elsa Aguirre, 57, who left her ranch home in Altadena, California, early Saturday. She, her husband and her cat were at a Red Cross shelter in a high school on Monday. Aguirre brought a box of mementos with her, including her mother's tea set from Argentina.\n\n\n\n\"The challenge is going to be going back to reality because I've been looking at the fire and the mountains from where I am,\" she said. \"The mountains look pretty spooky right now without any vegetation. ... I'm just taking it one day at a time.\"  Watch homeowners discuss fears \u00bb\n\n\n\nSchwarzenegger declared a state of emergency Friday as a result of the Station fire. The governor also declared a state of emergency in Monterey County, where one blaze, called the Gloria fire, has burned about 6,500 acres, and another, called the Bryson fire, has charred more than 3,000 acres, according to the Forest Service. On Sunday, Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in Placer County, his office said.\n\n\n\nThree people suffered burns while in the Big Tujunga Canyon recreational area, where three homes were destroyed by the Station fire, said Bruce Quintelier, fire information officer for the Forest Service.\n\n\n\nIn addition, two to three dozen recreational cabins were destroyed, said Randi Jorgensen, another Forest Service information officer.\n\n\n\nThe fire is also threatening communication towers on Mount Disappointment, Quintelier said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Rob Marciano, Chad Myers, John Torigoe and Stephanie Chen contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Richard Deitsch struggled through several days of denial before facing the fact that he was thousands of miles from home and he had no idea where his passport was.\n\n\n\nIt's most important to make copies of your passport, say experts. Web sites offer easy-access digital storage.\n\n\n\nThe Sports Illustrated reporter was covering the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, where he should have been having the time of his life. But his emotions were all over the place -- and none of them were good. His passport, he assumed, had fallen out of his backpack.\n\n\n\n\"When I realized it was missing, I went through a number of stages -- panic, fear, anger, and finally, acceptance,\" he wrote while enjoying a recent vacation in Russia. \"I looked for three days in every possible spot before I finally admitted to myself it was gone.\"\n\n\n\nDeitsch's bureaucratic nightmare reached a low point when he found himself inside a police station telling his story to five police officials who spoke no English. \"I was a wreck,\" he wrote later in a Sports Illustrated piece.\n\n\n\nHe had brought his own translator, an SI China reporter whom Deitsch credited with negotiating through the red tape and eventually saving his entire assignment.\n\n\n\nFortunately for Deitsch, he had prepared well for such an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe best thing Deitsch did, said travel experts, was to make several copies of his passport and work visa before departing for China. As a result, he had a replacement passport in his hands within a few days after he reported it missing.\n\n\n\nExperts seem to come from two schools of thought on how to protect a passport. Some prefer to lock the document away once they arrive in a destination, while others say keeping the passport with you is the best way to safeguard it.\n\n\n\nWhatever option you choose, the bottom line is, if you lose your passport you must be able to prove your identity and citizenship to the U.S. government. The best way to do it is to have a copy of your passport handy.\n\n\n\nDeitsch's experience has prompted him to become \"hyper-vigilant\" about his passport, he wrote. He usually chooses to lock the document in a safe during his travels, rarely carrying his passport on him.\n\n\n\n\"And when I do, I find myself grabbing the front of my pants-pocket every couple of minutes to make sure that it remains where it should,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nOnce it's clear your passport is lost, bring your passport copy and any other traveling or ID-related paperwork to the nearest embassy or consulate during business hours.\n\n\n\nBe prepared to spend at least four hours waiting in line, filling out forms and answering questions from officials.\n\n\n\nIf you didn't bring extra ID photos with you on your trip, have some taken before heading to the embassy or consulate. Make sure the photos are cropped to the correct size for your country's passport.\n\n\n\nIf you have no paperwork, take someone in your traveling party with you. They will have to vouch for you.\n\n\n\nU.S. citizens who are traveling alone and have no other way to prove their identification will be allowed to call \"family, friends or associates\" in the United States to confirm their identity, according to the U.S. State Department Web site.\n\n\n\nLaura Kidder, editorial director of Fodor's travel guides, suggested making color copies of the passport's data page and sticking them inside your luggage; you can scan them into a computer and e-mail them to yourself; or you can use an online document storage company.\n\n\n\n\"There's one [online company] that is particularly geared for passport and travel documents,\" Kidder said. She recommends the Australian Web site www.passportsupport.com, which costs about $15 Australian per year.\n\n\n\n\"This is the safest way to do it, which is more secure than you e-mailing it to yourself,\" said Kidder. Storing your passport data on a server offers higher security, she said, because the data is encrypted. In addition to passport documents, such services also will safely store data for tickets, drivers licenses, medical papers and lists of critical contacts.\n\n\n\nPassportsupport.com users are asked to scan their documents in jpg files. Users can then upload these files to the passportsupport.com server with the Web site's interface.\n\n\n\nKidder said she keeps copies of her documents in her luggage when traveling, and her passport secure in the hotel -- either in a self-service safe in the hotel room or a safe operated by the front desk.\n\n\n\nRather than safes, Robert Siciliano, CEO of IDTheftSecurity.com, said he prefers to hold his passport himself.\n\n\n\nSiciliano said he always carries his passport (and other valuables) on him, even when he heads down to a beach to relax with his laptop. He says if you plan to go in the water, know that someone is waiting to steal your stuff. Invest in portable alarms and don't lose sight of your possessions.\n\n\n\nSiciliano said locking passports in a room safe leaves you open to the possibility of a forgotten combination.\n\n\n\nIn those cases, a hotel will send someone to the room who can unlock the safe.\n\n\n\nDevices that unlock room safes can easily be bought online, Siciliano said.\n\n\n\nIt's a good example of how many people can access your room and safe if they want to go through your stuff.\n\n\n\n\"There are people out there that are focusing on you not paying attention, on you being trusting, you being naive,\" he says. \"You're putting your faith and trust in someone who might have problems. People are flawed.\"\n\n\n\nThe best way to protect yourself is to buy a passport holder for $10-$20 and always keep it on you, Siciliano said. Wear it under a shirt and pull it out only if needed. Never put it in a backpack or a purse.\n\n\n\nExperts said preparation is most important; you need to do your research and have multiple copies of everything.\n\n\n\n\"I always have backup for my backup,\" Siciliano said.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- He's already served the time, but lawyers Thursday argued to clear his name as onetime U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Smith appeals a conviction for the torture of detainees once held at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\n\n\nAbu Ghraib prison was taken over by the Iraqi government after claims of abuse by U.S. troops.\n\n\n\nDisturbing snapshots and video portraying sexual humiliation and physical intimidation against the detainees tarnished the image of the United States as it fought to stabilize Iraq after the American overthrow of Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nA military panel found Smith guilty in March 2006 on allegations that he used his military working dog to illegally \"terrorize and frighten\" detainees as part of interrogation techniques at the U.S.-managed facility in Baghdad.\n\n\n\nBut his lawyer, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jonathan Potter, told a military appeals court Thursday that the conviction was based on faulty instructions to the jury.\n\n\n\n\"Nowhere in this case did the government establish that the use of the dog was illegal,\" the defense counsel said, noting that Smith \"was not trained in interrogation techniques.\"\n\n\n\nThe military's prosecutor, U.S. Army Maj. Karen Borgerding, argued that Smith \"would know it's unlawful\" to use his unmuzzled dog to snarl within inches of a detained prisoner's face.\n\n\n\nSmith was originally sentenced to 179 days confinement and received a bad conduct discharge.\n\n\n\nSmith was not in the courtroom for the proceedings. Potter told CNN that he was not authorized to disclose his whereabouts but confirmed that his client remains on \"appeal release\" status after completing a three-month sentence.\n\n\n\nIf the appeal fails, the discharge stands. If the appeals court overturns the conviction, Smith could return to the military and may receive back pay, pension and other benefits. The judges did not indicate when they may rule after each side presented oral arguments Thursday.\n\n\n\nAt the 2006 court-martial, the jury found Smith guilty of charges that he used his military dog, Marco, to terrify prisoners, allegedly for amusement and in competition with other soldiers.\n\n\n\nSmith also was found guilty of an indecent act involving his dog.\n\n\n\nA female soldier testified on the first day of the court-martial that she had allowed Smith's dog to lick peanut butter she had placed on her bare chest as part of a dare from another soldier, who videotaped the stunt.\n\n\n\n\"It was foolish, stupid and juvenile,\" Smith said of the incident, reading from a statement. \"There's nothing I can do to take it back. If I could, I would.\"\n\n\n\nSmith did not specifically express regret for the wrongdoing involving detainees.",

One in Nairobi, Kenya, killed 213 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmed Khalfan Ghailani, from Tanzania, faces nine charges, six of them offenses that could carry the death penalty if he is convicted by a military tribunal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was captured by Pakistan in 2004 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a written announcement, the Pentagon said Ghailani is \"charged with the following substantive offenses: murder in violation of the Law of War, murder of protected persons, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the Law of War and terrorism. In addition, he is charged with conspiracy to commit all of the above offenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ghailani is further charged with providing material support to terrorism. This charge alleges that after the bombing, Ghailani continued in his service to al Qaeda as a document forger, physical trainer at an al Qaeda training camp, and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charges say he purchased bomb components, scouted the embassy with the suicide bomb driver, met with co-conspirators, and fled to Karachi, Pakistan, one day before the bombing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe convening authority for military commissions, Susan J. Crawford, will determine whether probable cause exists for a trial by military commission, said Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartman of the Office of Military Commissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Ghailani to ultimately be sentenced to death, the 12-member jury would have to unanimously find him guilty, determine that aggravating factors apply, and concur on the death sentence, Hartman told reporters at the Pentagon. \"Everything has to be unanimous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And then there are four levels of post-trial review, which is an extraordinary set of rights available,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December, 1998 -- a few months after the embassy bombings -- Ghailani and three other fugitives were indicted in U.S. District Court in New York. It is not known whether he may ultimately face a federal trial.  E-mail to a friend",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Rick Lyke was diagnosed with prostate cancer when he was 47. His response was to set up \"Pints for Prostates,\" an organization that uses the universal language of beer to reach men with its message about the importance of prostate cancer screening.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, at the insistence of a colleague with prostate cancer, Lyke, from Charlotte, North Carolina, had himself tested for illness, even though he had no health problems.\n\n\n\nHis doctor was initially reluctant to have him tested, as men under the age of 50 aren't considered to a high-risk group for prostate cancer, but tests came back positive and Lyke needed surgery to remove the cancer.\n\n\n\nHis surgeon said that if Lyke had waited until he was 50 to be screened, he would probably have only lived another two or three years.\n\n\n\n\"I'm doing great now,\" Lyke told CNN. \"I have to get tested every six months for the next 15 years, but I really feel like I dodged a bullet.\"\n\n\n\nProstate cancer affects one in six men American men, with 27,000 Americans expected to die from the disease this year.\n\n\n\nThe American Cancer Society believes health care professionals should discuss the potential benefits and limitations of prostate cancer early detection testing with men before any testing begins. It says that should include an offer for yearly testing with the prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal exam, beginning at age 50, to men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and have at least a 10-year life expectancy.\n\n\n\nBut Lyke says other groups recommend that men should be screened once they reach their forties.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a financial issue in a lot of cases rather than a health issue as to why that guideline is 50,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"The fact of the matter is not many men are going to have prostate cancer in their forties, but for those who do, if they wait until they're 50 to be tested, their numbers aren't going to look very good.\"\n\n\n\nLyke founded \"Pints for Prostates\" to spread the message about need for regular prostate health screenings. The organization travels to beer festivals and tries to engage with men in an informal way.\n\n\n\n\"Beer is a universal thing for men,\" Lyke told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"Where women get together and talk about health issues, men really don't, so we try to use an atmosphere like a pub, where guys are a little bit more relaxed, to talk about prostate cancer.\"\n\n\n\nHe says prostate cancer is a highly personal disease for men, in much the same way that breast cancer is for women. Treatment for prostate cancer can sometimes result in impotence.\n\n\n\n\"The pink ribbon campaign has really made it possible for women to talk about breast cancer, so we're trying to do the same thing for guys. They need permission to talk about it,\" said Lyke.\n\n\n\nAs well as setting up stalls at beer festivals and organizing events in pubs, \"Pints for Prostates\" has run adverts in magazines and Lyke estimates its message has reached about 30 million people.\n\n\n\nA year after his own surgery, Lyke's first granddaughter was born. He is aware that by being screened for prostate cancer he has vastly improved his chances of seeing her grow up, and he hopes that by encouraging other men to be tested he will give them a similar opportunity.\n\n\n\nHe told CNN, \"I'm hoping that there's a whole bunch of other guys out there who'll be able to experience the same thing [as me] -- see their families grow up and grow old.\"\n\n\n\nMark Tutton contributed to this report",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has played down the threat posed by Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi as two of European football's giants face off in the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nMessi has been in scintillating form all season, scoring all four goals in Barca's quarterfinal second leg victory over Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Argentine will spearhead the Barcelona attack in the first leg clash at Milan's San Siro stadium, but Mourinho sees the 22-year-old as just one part of a formidable team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we know is that he is an important player but football, for me, is not about marking man to man, Mourniho told reporters at a pre-match press conference in Milan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not one against Messi and 10 versus 10, it will be 11 v 11, although he deserves special attention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho is charged with plotting a path past the reigning European, Spanish and World Club champions who are seeking to become the first team to defend the European Cup since AC Milan in 1990.\n\n\n\n\n\nInter drew 0-0 at home with Barca in the group stage of this season's competition and were beaten 2-0 in Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Barca deserved to win in November,\" said Mourinho, who worked as a translator at Barcelona in the 1990s before becoming a manager and leading Porto to the Champions League trophy in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are as strong now as they were then, but we are much stronger. I don't mind if the football world considers them favorites, I think we have a 50% chance of playing in the final.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBarcelona arrived in Milan on Monday evening after being forced to travel for 14 hours by road because of the volcanic ash cloud hovering over Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not the ideal situation for us to travel 14 hours by coach after a league game and before a semi-final against Inter, but you cannot stop a volcano, can you?,\" said Barca coach Josep Guardiola.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We decided to use two buses to have more space and I didn't travel with the players because I think it's better for them not to always have their coach with them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuardiola is wary of the threat posed by a side who knocked out English Premier League leaders Chelsea in the last 16 and have won the Italian league title the last four years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're a very strong team and we'll need to play well twice. We'll play our game and try to score as many goals as possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we could lose because we're playing against one of the best teams in Europe.\"",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Actor Tim Roth is in an abandoned building near downtown Los Angeles, and he's about to mix things up.\n\n\n\nBritish actor Tim Roth plays a human lie detector on the hit series \"Lie to Me.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is a scene where the FBI is interrogating a suspect,\" Roth said. \"I'm breaking into the interrogation to get information out of him using the sort of techniques that my character espouses as opposed to pressuring him.\"\n\n\n\nRoth, who plays Dr. Cal Lightman on the hit Fox series \"Lie to Me,\" is shooting scenes for the season finale, which will air May 13. His character is an expert on body language and the detection of deception.\n\n\n\n\"Our series is based on the idea that we can read what's going on across your face and if it's contradicting what you're actually saying,\" Roth said.\n\n\n\nLightman and his colleague, Dr. Gillian Foster -- played by Kelli Williams -- run \"The Lightman Group.\"\n\n\n\nThey observe body language and interpret what it means in order to help law enforcement agencies see through the bull.\n\n\n\nHis character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a specialist who reads clues embedded in the human face, body and voice to expose the truth in criminal investigations.\n\n\n\nEkman, who in 2001 was named as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century by the American Psychological Association, is a scientific consultant for the show.\n\n\n\nRoth says Ekman can be intimidating.\n\n\n\n\"He makes me very, very nervous, Paul, you know,\" he said. \"I mean, he's the sweetest man, as sweet as can be, but when he's around, you feel like your acting is really being judged.\"\n\n\n\nRoth is perhaps best known for his outings with famed director Quentin Tarantino. The British actor pulled off a convincing American accent in the cult classics \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\"\n\n\n\nHe uses his true-Brit accent in \"Lie to Me,\" which debuted in January and is one of the season's few successful new dramas.\n\n\n\nIn a review for Entertainment Weekly, critic-at-large Ken Tucker wrote that \"Like 'Monk' and 'Psych' and 'The Mentalist,' 'Lie' offers us an eccentric who's brought in by law enforcement to solve crimes.\"\n\n\n\nThough he gave the show a B-minus, Tucker praised Roth for \"resist[ing] the cuddly/cranky.\"\n\n\n\nThe show has quickly found its fan base, though ratings have declined slightly since the show was put in its 8 p.m. Wednesday time slot, ahead of \"American Idol.\" (The first five episodes aired after \"Idol.\")\n\n\n\n\"I got stopped because one of my lights was out and I was coming back from work and the guy, the cop that stopped me said 'Oh, we watch your show' and they seemed to enjoy it,\" said Roth.\n\n\n\n\"ER\" alum Mekhi Phifer is set to join the cast as an FBI agent for two episodes this season, starting Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"I'm here to kick ass and take names, you know. So it's kind of different,\" Phifer said. \"It's fun, you know. Obviously, I carry a gun and I'm in law enforcement rather than being a doctor.\"\n\n\n\nPhifer particularly likes acting in intense scenes with Roth.\n\n\n\n\"I have my own way of doing it,\" he said. \"It's a little different than the way Tim does it. It's a lot of fun, and we're having a great time.\"\n\n\n\nAnd will time spent on the show help Phifer better detect when people are lying to him in real life?\n\n\n\n\"It's going to take a few more episodes, but I'm pretty perceptive,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRoth, however, makes no claims of special powers -- at least when he's away from the set.\n\n\n\n\"I try not to know too much, because it actually is quite extraordinary,\" he says. \"When you watch politicians on TV, you can use the stuff that Paul does to see if they're lying or not. I try not to take it home.\"",

  "context": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Scientific tests prove bones housed in the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome are those of the apostle St. Paul himself, according to Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI looks at the tomb of St. Paul at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome in 2007.\n\n\n\n\"Tiny fragments of bone\" in the sarcophagus were subjected to carbon dating, showing they \"belong to someone who lived in the first or second century,\" the pope said in a homily carried on Italian television.\n\n\n\n\"This seems to confirm the unanimous and undisputed tradition that these are the mortal remains of the Apostle St. Paul,\" Benedict said in Sunday's announcement.\n\n\n\nThe tomb also holds \"traces of a precious linen cloth, purple in color and laminated with pure gold, and a blue colored textile with linen filaments,\" the pope said.\n\n\n\nThe tests were carried out by inserting a probe into a small opening in the sarcophagus, \"which had not been opened for many centuries,\" the pontiff said. The probe \"also revealed the presence of grains of red incense and traces of protein and limestone.\"\n\n\n\nSeparately, archaeologists have uncovered an image of St. Paul which \"could be considered the oldest icon of the apostle known to date,\" the Vatican's official newspaper reported Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe painting, in the St. Tecla Catacomb, is \"among the oldest and best-defined figures from ancient Christianity,\" according to the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology, L'Osservatore Romano reported.\n\n\n\nSt. Paul is one of the most significant figures in Christianity. Originally a persecutor of early Christians, he became a follower of Jesus after seeing a vision on the road to Damascus, according to Christian tradition.\n\n\n\n\"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\" the vision of Jesus asks Paul, using the apostle's birth name, in the Acts of the Apostles.\n\n\n\nSaul then took the name Paul and became a missionary. His letters, or epistles, to early Christian communities around the Mediterranean form a significant portion of the New Testament.\n\n\n\nPaul was beheaded by Roman authorities sometime between 65 and 67 A.D., according to the Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nHe was buried a few miles away, and when the Roman Empire stopped persecuting Christians some 250 years later, the Emperor Constantine had a basilica built over his grave.\n\n\n\nIt currently lies under a marble tombstone bearing the Latin inscription PAULO APOSTOLO MART (Apostle Paul, martyr), according to the Web site of the basilica. A papal altar stands over the tombstone, which is visible through a window-like opening, the Web site says.\n\n\n\nMonday marks the end of a year of celebration in honor of the 2,000th anniversary of St. Paul's birth. It also happens to be the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\n\n\nCNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Katie Callaway Hall trembled for four hours when she heard Phillip Garrido was arrested.\n\n\n\nKatie Callaway Hall said she wanted to scream when she heard that Phillio Garrido kidnapped someone else.\n\n\n\nHis name sent a flurry of emotion running through her mind.\n\n\n\n\"I screamed,\" she told CNN's Larry King on Monday night. \"I started screaming 'Oh my god, Oh my god, it's him.' \"\n\n\n\nShe has thought about him every day since November 22, 1976 when he asked her for a ride at a supermarket in California, before handcuffing her, binding her and taking her to a mini-warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he raped her.  Watch victim describe her terror \u00bb\n\n\n\nGarrido was convicted for kidnapping and raping Hall, but was released after serving just over 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole.\n\n\n\n\"In many ways, the capture of Phillip Garrido has closed a chapter in my life,\" Hall wrote for a Larry King blog. \"I don't have to hide anymore. I don't have to live every day of my life wondering if he is looking for me. I am finally free from the fear I have lived with since the day I learned he was paroled.\" Read what Hall wrote on the blog\n\n\n\nGarrido and his wife, Nancy, were charged last week with crimes relating to the abduction of 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard in 1991 and her captivity in a hidden shed-and-tent compound in the couple's backyard in Antioch, California.\n\n\n\n\"With all the joy I should feel, I want to scream from the depths of my soul,\" she said. \"Scream because my fears turned out to be justified -- he struck again.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Hall has tried to suppress some of the memories of what happened to her that night, Garrido's arrest took her mind back to that night in November.\n\n\n\n\"A man tapped on my window and asked for a ride,\" she said. \"I agreed.\"\n\n\n\nWhen she stopped the car to drop him off, Garrido took the keys out of the ignition, according to court documents from Garrido's appeal in the case.\n\n\n\nGarrido, then 25, \"told [Hall] it wasn't intentional that he had taken her, but that it was her fault because she was attractive,\" according to the documents.\n\n\n\n\"Soon after, I was cuffed, bound, gagged, and taken to a warehouse,\" Hall told CNN.\n\n\n\nShe was kept in the 6 by 12-foot storage facility, which Hall remembers was stacked with half-opened boxes with China-type dishes inside.\n\n\n\nLarge, heavy carpets were hanging from the ceiling, spaced apart every few feet.\n\n\n\n\"It was like a maze,\" she said. \"And in the back of the mini warehouse where he had me, he had it set up to keep someone for awhile.\"\n\n\n\n\"Most of the details about what happened to me after I entered that warehouse have been repressed.\"\n\n\n\nShe told Larry King that she feared for her life.\n\n\n\n\"I thought I was dead,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHall was held in the small storage facility for five hours before she heard a noise.\n\n\n\n\"My recollections begin around 3 a.m. Someone banged on the door. I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, his friends are coming,' \" she said. \"Garrido said, 'Do I have to tie you up or are you going to be good.' \"\n\n\n\nShe told him she would be good, but she knew if it was the police banging outside, she was going to \"have to try something.\"\n\n\n\n\"I barreled my way out of the warehouse completely naked. I could see the officer and Garrido standing there. They both looked at me like I was crazy,\" she said. \"I couldn't see the officer's car. I thought 'Oh God, he's not a real cop.' My state of mind was such that I couldn't fully embrace what I was seeing. Finally, I saw his police car.\"\n\n\n\nGarrido tried to tell the cop Hall was his girlfriend.\n\n\n\n\"I screamed, 'No I'm not -- help me, help me,' \" she said.\n\n\n\n\"The officer told me to go back in and put my clothes on. When I went inside, Garrido must have convinced the officer we were both on drugs, because he let Garrido go back into the building alone,\" Hall said. \"I had already put some of my clothes on. Garrido came back in and begged me not to turn him in.\"\n\n\n\nHalf-dressed, Hall said she maneuvered past him and asked the police to keep him away.\n\n\n\n\"They asked if I was brought there against my will,\" she said. \"I told them I was, that he had handcuffed and bound me. An officer shined a light on my wrists, saw the sores from the handcuffs, and arrested Garrido.\"\n\n\n\nThough Garrido was put behind bars for what he did, Hall said that night changed her life forever.\n\n\n\n\"For years, I walked around like a zombie,\" she said. \"I had to tell everyone I met what had happened to me -- because I didn't feel like myself. It was as if I had to explain why I wasn't 'normal.' \"\n\n\n\nFor her, that's the biggest pain Garrido put her though.\n\n\n\n\"I was a good person. I lived right, and treated others well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"He changed my life in an instant. I don't feel like I can ever be that person again. Being victimized is something that only a victim can understand. I hate that he did this to me, and I doubt I'll ever get over it.\"\n\n\n\nThough the trauma of her kidnapping has stayed with her all of these years, Hall said she couldn't even begin to imagine the pain Garrido has caused Dugard and the two children she had with him.\n\n\n\n\"The only thing I can think of worse than what happened to me, is it happening to my child,\" she said. \"I can't imagine what Jaycee is going through. He had me for 8 hours. He had her for 18 years.\n\n\n\n\"I was an adult, with instincts that helped me deal with the situation. She was a child. This is going to be with her for the rest of her life. I can only wish her the best.\"",

  "context": "(Mental Floss) -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January.\n\n\n\nPresident Bush's dog Barney, left, plays in 2001 with Spot, the offspring of George H.W. Bush's dog Millie.\n\n\n\nIt's a good thing Obama said \"Yes, we can\" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet.\n\n\n\nCounting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets.\n\n\n\nLike Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House?\n\n\n\nHere are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on \"mutts like me\" \u00bb\n\n\n\n1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus\n\n\n\nCalvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets.\n\n\n\nAfter taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.\n\n\n\nHe had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo \u00bb\n\n\n\nBilly was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.\n\n\n\nHe came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)\n\n\n\nCoolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.\n\n\n\nHe sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes\n\n\n\n2. The White House gators\n\n\n\nHerbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and ... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true.\n\n\n\nHoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds.\n\n\n\nSound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests.\n\n\n\n3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion\n\n\n\nWhat do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog.\n\n\n\nIn 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend.\n\n\n\nFDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala.\n\n\n\nAfter that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went.\n\n\n\nThe dog \"gave\" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala.\n\n\n\nFala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone.\n\n\n\n\"You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious.\n\n\n\n\"He has not been the same dog since!\"\n\n\n\nFala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs\n\n\n\n4. Millie: Literary sensation\n\n\n\nWhen George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House.\n\n\n\nThe bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush.\n\n\n\nMillie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989.\n\n\n\nJust as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher.\n\n\n\n5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents\n\n\n\nSadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now.\n\n\n\nThey have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by \"Willie.\"  Watch Barney bite a reporter \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs \"Bush.\"\n\n\n\nThe name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben \"El Indio\" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher.\n\n\n\nOther first pets of note:\n\n\n\nMr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers.\n\n\n\nPauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption.\n\n\n\nOld Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco.\n\n\n\nLaddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 \"interview\" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs.\n\n\n\nLiberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations.\n\n\n\nSocks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie.\n\n\n\nGamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House.\n\n\n\nTwo tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo.\n\n\n\nSatan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno.\n\n\n\nJonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, \"partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs.\n\n\n\nJosiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course.\n\n\n\nBonus trivia: Checkers\n\n\n\nNixon's dog was immortalized in the \"Checkers speech,\" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions.\n\n\n\nHe said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important?\n\n\n\nCheckers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket.\n\n\n\nAlthough the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964.\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- Brazil's highest court said Wednesday it does not have jurisdiction over who should have custody of a U.S.-born 9-year-old boy -- his Brazilian stepfather or his father in the United States.\n\n\n\nDavid Goldman is seeking custody of his son, Sean, who is living with relatives of his deceased mother in Brazil.\n\n\n\nThe high court's ruling sends the ongoing case back to an appeals court in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\nIn the unanimous vote, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court said it could not rule over The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, of which Brazil is a signatory. Brazil is undergoing constitutional reforms and has recently voted on a law that would make all international human rights conventions part of its constitution.\n\n\n\nLast week, Judge Marco Aurelio, who sits on the Supreme Federal Court, suspended a lower court ruling that custody of Sean Richard Goldman be turned over to the U.S. consulate, which was to have then handed him over to the boy's father, David Goldman, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\n\n\nAurelio's decision was based on a conservative party's petition that said the boy's removal from Brazil would cause him psychological harm.\n\n\n\nBut the father responded that his son was suffering psychological harm simply by remaining with his Brazilian relatives, whom Goldman -- a part-time model who captains boats -- accused of turning Sean against him.\n\n\n\nThe case now goes to the Federal Appeals Court in Rio de Janeiro and does not mean the boy will return to his father without further rulings.\n\n\n\nGoldman said that he and his lawyers would have to study the high court decision, but he expressed optimism about what he had learned.\n\n\n\n\"There seemed to be a lot of good remarks that they want to honor the Hague Convention; they believe in the Hague Convention and they want to return children. Hopefully, they sent that message to the lower federal courts, and they'll hear that message.\"  Watch CNN's Campbell Brown talk with Goldman before latest ruling \u00bb\n\n\n\nHe said, \"It's not over.\"\n\n\n\nThe incident began in June 2004, when Goldman's then-wife, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, took Sean from the family's New Jersey home for what was to have been a two-week vacation in her native Brazil.\n\n\n\nBut instead of returning, she divorced Goldman, married a Brazilian lawyer, and remained in Brazil with the boy. She died there last September giving birth to a daughter.\n\n\n\nIn Rio, Sean attends a private school and lives in a sprawling home with his half-sister and his stepfather.\n\n\n\nIn March, a spokesman for the boy's Brazilian relatives said he did not dispute the father's biological rights, but said other matters needed to be weighed.\n\n\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that, in order to be a parent, you have to be more than a DNA donor,\" said Helvecio Ribeiro. \"Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures. It's about sacrifice; it's about providing support for your child; it's about being there even when you are not there.\"\n\n\n\nHe said Goldman had failed to do that and accused him of having \"paid not a dime of child support\" and made allegations \"all over the place about us not allowing him to visit the child that are completely untrue.\"\n\n\n\nGoldman responded, \"Can you take someone's child to another country and then expect the parent to support you in the abduction of the child?\"\n\n\n\nHe said he had been making tireless efforts since his son was \"abducted\" to have him repatriated, \"never, ever stopping.\"\n\n\n\nThe case has attracted attention from politicians. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has discussed the matter with Brazil's foreign minister.\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, some 66 American-born children have been taken by a parent to Brazil, in violation of international treaties.\n\n\n\nJournalist Helena DeMoura contributed to this story.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Justice Antonin Scalia is a conservative in thought, but not in personality. A new biography of the colorful Supreme Court jurist paints a complete picture of his enormous ongoing influence on the law and society.\n\n\n\n\"American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\" (Farrar, Straus, Giroux) offers the first comprehensive look at the first Italian-American on the high court, and the rhetorical battles he has waged on the court and off.\n\n\n\nCNN spoke with Joan Biskupic, the book's author, who also is a reporter for USA Today. Biskupic has covered the high court for two decades, holds a law degree from Georgetown University and has also written a biography of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n\n\nCNN: Justice Scalia has a certain public image in the minds of many Americans. You've known him for years and interviewed him several times for this book. Is he the same in private?\n\n\n\nBiskupic: He's a lot more of himself in private. He actually is very confrontational behind the scenes, just as he is in public. He's very defiant. But he also can be quite funny, quite casual, generous and decent. His best friend on the bench is Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg [a low-key, liberal justice but, like Scalia, a native New Yorker who loves opera]. He's many things. He's very consistent on the law, but he's a lot of things in terms of his personality.\n\n\n\nCNN: He has told me that one of the happiest times in his career was in the executive branch, where he said that's where the action was, instead of serving on the bench.\n\n\n\nBiskupic: Remember what it was like working in the [Department of Justice's] Office of Legal Counsel in the post-Watergate era [in the Nixon and Ford administrations]. It was an exciting job for him, there was a lot of tension, and conflicts with the legislative branch. He really thrived on that. At a time when many Republican lawyers were trying to get out of the Nixon administration, as Watergate was moving to a climax, he was trying to move up and be promoted. He sparred with Democratic lawmakers, and was trying to exert executive privilege claims, when that was a dirty word in the wake of Watergate.\n\n\n\nCNN: Growing up, you describe \"Nino\" -- as his friends and family call him -- as something of a golden child.\n\n\n\nBiskupic: I'd always known he was an only child, who, interestingly, later went on to have nine children, but I didn't know he was the only offspring of his generation from two immigrant Italian families. For his parents and his aunts and uncles, he was the center of their universe, but it put a burden on him to perform, to be this special child. I found the conflicts in terms of being a product of two different families continue to reveal himself. The father was quite cerebral, was a professor, always had his nose in a book, he didn't abide any kind of silliness. And his mother's side was much more flamboyant. You had these contrasting families, and, as I write in the book, he learned to deal with conflict and tension early on in his life, and went on to readily generate it as an adult.\n\n\n\nCNN: Many conservatives worship Scalia, and yet you suggest his influence has not had as far-reaching an effect inside the high court as many believe it to be. How do his colleagues view him?\n\n\n\nBiskupic: I talked to his colleagues about where he's at. Justice [John Paul] Stevens says he is committed -- some of his impact made a huge difference, some of it unfortunate. Stevens, the senior liberal, has dueled with Justice Scalia dozens of times, from Bush v. Gore [the 2000 presidential election dispute] to recent dilemmas testing the Guantanamo detainees. Justice Ginsburg, his closest friend on the court, sees his influence beyond the marble walls, and that's the way I've been mostly viewing him until the recent terms. He is influential with conservative acolytes. Within the court, he certainly alienated [now-retired Justice Sandra Day] O'Connor, Justice [Harry] Blackmun, and in some ways Justice [Anthony] Kennedy. It made his influence rather slight for years -- he really didn't want to deal, to negotiate with his colleagues in rulings. Despite a charming personality in many ways, he told me he had nothing to trade. He was just plain firm about where he wanted to go, and he wouldn't settle for half a loaf.\n\n\n\nThe addition of Chief Justice [John] Roberts and Justice [Samuel] Alito on the bench allowed him to win more. And in recent terms, there has a been a culmination, a resurgence, on what he is able to do, now with the [conservative] bodies coming on the court to support him. But he told me he was still not satisfied. \"The wins,\" he told me, \"Damn few.\"\n\n\n\nCNN: In his bright, bold opinions, what is he trying to accomplish? Does he reach for broader audience?\n\n\n\nBiskupic: Look at 1996's Romer v. Evans -- the gay rights case. He lost on that one, and his dissent was written for consumption way beyond the court. It was a complete battle cry. He lashes out at the court for placing what he said was \"the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias.\" This dissent became more of a story than the opinion itself. People were reading it and giving it airspace, and that's what he wanted. That was his style of most of the '90s: Get as much attention as possible, because he was in dissent so much in big cases.\n\n\n\nNow, in the recent Heller case case [where Scalia wrote the main opinion striking down Washington, D.C.'s, strict handgun ban], he was not going able to write an opinion as boldly as he may have wanted, in terms of some of the zingers that he packs into his other opinions, because he has to keep his majority. But he still will not mince words if he is in dissent, because he knows journalists, law students, policy makers will all pay attention, and it will influence people down the road.\n\n\n\nCNN: And yet controversy seems to dog him, including the duck hunting trip he took with Vice President [Dick] Cheney at a time the high court was considering an appeal from Cheney's office; and a hand gesture Scalia made outside a Catholic church some interpreted as obscene.\n\n\n\nBiskupic: I don't think he cares. He's got these intense feelings he's not going to keep in check.\n\n\n\nCNN: What prompted this project, and what do you want readers to know about Justice Scalia?\n\n\n\nBiskupic: I found most of what was written about him was either one side or the other -- screeds easily from the left and embraces easily from the right. And I thought there was so much to his background that was worth revealing in an objective way, to see what he was all about: How Scalia became Scalia. He was really part of the conservative moment we saw in the 1980s. Young lawyers at the time like John Roberts and Samuel Alito embraced his theories, and look where they ended up.\n\n\n\nCNN: In your interviews with him and his family, did you expect that level of cooperation?\n\n\n\nBiskupic: No, I didn't. In the beginning, he said he would encourage colleagues to talk to me, but he didn't want to sit and talk on the record. But he soon became quite intrigued at my research into his family, immigration records and such. And I'd be at my desk, and he'd be calling me, asking me what I found out about his ancestors. So those later, extensive interviews made this book.\n\n\n\nCNN: There is a challenge about writing on the often cloistered world of the Supreme Court, these personalities that remain below the radar for most people.\n\n\n\nBiskupic: I wanted a book that would demystify him, and make people understand him. I wanted readers to know: This is your court, you should know about these people and what they're up to. But it is tough, it's so hard to get information about the institution that doesn't have to do with the precise words on the rulings. And it's fun to dig up this background, and get in with these justices and talk with them one-on-one. I was so grateful to speak with Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and even Justice [Clarence] Thomas, who all shared great stories and offered their insights into Justice Scalia.",

  "context": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A trendy California sushi restaurant charged by federal authorities with serving whale meat offered an apology Monday, saying it \"ignored its responsibilities\" to endangered species.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc., the parent company of Santa Monica's The Hump, and chef Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 45, with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whales -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We write to address the misdemeanor charge recently filed by the U.S. attorney,\" the restaurant said in a statement posted on its Web site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The charge against the restaurant is true: The Hump served whale meat to customers looking to eat what in Japan is widely served as a delicacy,\" the statement continued. \"In serving this meat, The Hump ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe restaurant pledged to set up procedures to ensure that it complies with laws and \"becomes a good corporate citizen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We sincerely apologize. We pledge to work hard to re-earn the trust of the public and respect of our customers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $200,000 for the company, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law firm for the restaurant and its parent company deferred questions to The Hump's Web site. However, Typhoon attorney Gary Lincenberg has said the restaurant accepts responsibility for serving whale and will agree to pay a fine, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation into the restaurant began in October, when two members of the team that made the documentary \"The Cove\" visited The Hump, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Cove,\" which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village, won the Academy Award for best documentary this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe restaurant, located at the Santa Monica Airport, is known for its exotic fare. Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for \"a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCrowd marches outside restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\nArmed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as \"whale\" and \"horse\" with the cost -- $85 -- written next to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University. He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sei is found throughout the world's oceans. Whalers began to hunt them after the populations of right, humpback, blue and fin whales declined due to overfishing. It is now considered an endangered species.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February and March, the activists returned and again asked for -- and were served -- whale meat, the criminal complaint said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA DNA test of the meat smuggled out after the February visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale, Mrozek said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a final visit in March, officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the activists asking for \"kujira,\" or whale meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the officers then saw the sushi chef leave the restaurant and return with a wrapped package that he seemed to have retrieved from a parked Mercedes, the complaint said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chef told a customer it was whale meat, the document said. Next, officials raided the restaurant, and chef Yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat, the complaint said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species,\" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said.\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation agencies are engaged in an ongoing feud with Japan over whaling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting. However, whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales. Many in the international community believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- With phone lines down and communication cut, Haitians living in America are \"sick with worry\" and scrambling for information about loved ones who experienced Tuesday's 7.0 earthquake on the island nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At this point it looks like it's worse than we all imagined and we still don't know specifics because of the down power lines,\" Gepsi Metellus said Wednesday. She is the executive director of the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center in Miami, Florida, which provides services to Haitians in South Florida ranging from help with taxes to how to navigate the American school system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are assuming there are a lot more casualties than we might have initially thought,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetellus said she still hasn't heard from her mother, who splits her time between Haiti -- she lives in P\u00e9tionville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince -- and Miami. Her mother flew from Miami to Haiti on Friday. \"She's in her 70s. I'm very concerned.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMetellus is also trying to find out how the center can best help people in Haiti, but without information, that's difficult to ascertain at the moment. \"There are people who want to drop off medicine and food and water at the center, but we don't even know if that's what's needed, much less if we will be able to get those supplies to the island.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you looking for loved ones in Haiti?\n\n\n\n\n\nHaiti is the most impoverished nation in the Western Hemisphere. Plagued with \"political violence for most of its history,\" according to the CIA World Factbook, the Caribbean island nation has suffered from colonialism, coups and corruption since becoming the first black republic in 1804.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you there? Submit an iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half of the country lives in \"abject poverty.\" The nation imports more than four times the goods it exports and about two-thirds of the labor force lacks formal jobs, the CIA reports. There are 45,000 Americans living in Haiti, and the U.S. Embassy, as of Wednesday, has been able to reach only 40 of them, according to a release from the U.S. State Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetellus said the Haitian community in South Florida numbers from 250,000 to 500,000 people. \"The basic infrastructure we're accustomed to here is nonexistent [in Haiti]. To assess the damage is going to be a momentous undertaking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete coverage of the earthquake\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease is rampant in Haiti, and it's still common for children to die from drinking and washing in fecal contaminated water. UNICEF estimates that 70 percent of Haitians do not have access to \"safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNyvrose Fleurent of Brooklyn, New York, works for the community outreach group Haitian American United Progress and said most Haitian immigrants in the United States have family still on the island. They often financially support family members who aren't able to leave, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead about Haiti donations contributed through Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nFleurent said this Tuesday while watching the news. Earlier in the morning she had hugged her brother goodbye before he flew to the Port-au-Prince airport in Haiti.\n\n\n\n\n\nFleurent, 38, remains hopeful her family will be unharmed. Her brother and cousins reside in Cap-Ha\u00eftien, in the north, on the opposite side of the country from Port-au-Prince, the city closest to the earthquake's epicenter.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven so, she worried about the impact the quake will have on her struggling home country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The people who live there can barely make it,\" Fleurent said. \"They can't even eat and get money for their basic needs, so this is going to be a big blow for them. I don't know where Haiti is going to be in the future. It's already so bad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarley Etienne, a Georgia Institute of Technology professor of public policy, fretted Wednesday about his uncle, cousins and his best friend's mother who live in a suburb of Port-au-Prince. \"It's all making my family here [in the U.S.] very nervous and scared,\" he said. \"My uncle lives on a hill so it's quite upsetting. He lives in the same house that my father and his six brothers and sisters grew up in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All we can do is wait and hope,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State Department Operations Center has set up the following number for Americans seeking information about family members in Haiti: 1-888-407-4747\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Jessica Ravitz, Stephanie Chen, Ashley Fantz and John Blake contributed to this report.",

  "context": "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Some families long separated by the Korean War saw their loved ones Saturday for the first time in years near the border between North and South Korea.\n\n\n\nSouth Korean Yoon Ki-Dal, right, meets the children he left behind as babies during the Korean War.\n\n\n\nYoon Ki-Dal, 88, of South Korea thought such a moment would never come. After leaving his son and daughters when they were babies during the Korean War, he was able to hold the hands of his North Korean children on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\"Father, we thought you were dead,\" his daughter, now in her 60s, told him, her face trembling.\n\n\n\nTheir family was one of 97 reunited Saturday on Mount Keumgang, a North Korean resort near the eastern part of the border, after decades of separation by war and ideology.\n\n\n\nAnd soon these families will be separated again. They are allowed to be together for a few days. Then the South Koreans must return home.\n\n\n\nThe reunions -- the first in nearly two years -- are taking place through October 1.\n\n\n\nMillions of families were separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire and no formal peace treaty. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border.\n\n\n\nThe agreement to hold the reunions came after North and South Korea held three days of talks, mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, last month, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported at the time.\n\n\n\nAbout 10,000 people applied to take part in the reunion, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate. In addition to the 97 families who met Saturday, another 99 families are expected to meet next week, authorities said.  Watch families share hugs, tears \u00bb\n\n\n\nParticipants are selected randomly, and there is no date set for a further reunion, which means the tens of thousands of others who were separated by the Korean War have no idea when they may get a chance to see their loved ones -- if ever.\n\n\n\nFor the many separated family members who are elderly, a reunion may never be possible.\n\n\n\nReunions between North and South have been taking place off and on since 2000 after an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, Yonhap says. The last reunion took place in October 2007.\n\n\n\nRapprochement talks between the two Koreas have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun.\n\n\n\nThe two Koreas have remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953.\n\n\n\nLast month, officials from both sides had the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years when South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon.\n\n\n\nThe meetings and reunions are in stark contrast to the tense public statements each side made about each other earlier this year.\n\n\n\nTensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan, also referred to as the East Sea. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea condemned the action, calling the launches \"unwise.\"\n\n\n\nJournalist Sohn Jie-Ae contributed to this report.",

He heads the powerful Sinaloa cartel, investigators say. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame the Sinaloa and other cartels for a surge in violence in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe ranked 701st on Forbes' yearly report, with an estimated fortune of $1 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora expressed outrage at the publication and described Forbes' calculations on Guzman Loera's fortune as mere \"speculation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I will never accept that a criminal could be recognized as someone distinguished, even if it is by a magazine like Forbes,\" Medina Mora said to local media during a drug traffic summit Thursday in Vienna, Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\nForbes is \"comparing the deplorable activity of a criminal wanted in Mexico and abroad with that of honest businessmen,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon -- speaking at a business summit Thursday in Mexico City -- alluded to the report, saying, \"It is very sad the intensification of a campaign, which seems to me, has been launched against Mexico.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCalderon added, \"Public opinion and now even magazines not only attack and lie about the situation in Mexico, but now also praise criminals. In Mexico, it is considered a crime to praise criminals.\"  Guzman Loera has a three-decade history of drug trade spanning North, Central and South America. The Forbes profile of Guzman Loera reported that \"the U.S. government is offering a $5 million reward\" for the billionaire's capture.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Forbes, the magazine's editor-in-chief, issued a statement on Saturday saying \"it is deplorable that someone like this has a billion dollars.\" But the magazine, he said, was simply doing its job and reporting a fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Forbes has listed other criminals from Meyer Lansky (1982) to Pablo Escobar (1987-1993) on our Rich Lists,\" Forbes said. \"Don't shoot the messenger.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIts article offers a rationale as to why Guzman Loera made the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So is there anywhere one can still make a fortune these days? The 38 newcomers offer a few clues. Among the more notable new billionaires are Mexican Joaquin Guzman Loera, one of the biggest suppliers of cocaine to the U.S.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- As a young working mother in the the early 1980s, Diane Wood, like many of her generation, struggled to balance work and family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future judge and Supreme Court contender had just accepted a job teaching law in Chicago, Illinois, while pregnant with her second child.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after David was born, the professor went into anaphylactic shock and was rushed to the hospital with post-pregnancy complications. Despite her serious condition, she recovered quickly, but really had no choice. Friends say that with two young kids and a new job, no maternity leave was offered, and her male colleagues at work were mostly clueless over how to deal with her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People had no idea what to do with the fact that I had these two tiny children,\" she told an interviewer last year. Overcoming institutional and social challenges to become a nationally recognized legal heavyweight and high court contender, colleagues say, is a testament to Wood's intellectual and personal fortitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer long, relatively liberal judicial record presents both a measure of certainty about the kind of justice she would become, and a political challenge getting her confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Diane Wood is among the most respected federal judges on the left,\" said Thomas Goldstein, a Supreme Court legal analyst and founder of scotusblog.com. \"Being a woman is a political plus, but she has decided cases on abortion, affirmative action, religion, and the like. That will generate more of a political firestorm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWood has sat on the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago since 1995. Considered one of the sharpest minds on that bench, she has known President Obama from their days as part-time instructors at the University of Chicago. They have remained casual friends since then. She will turn 60 in July and is among the oldest candidates being given serious scrutiny for the high court.\n\n\n\n\n\nAware of her liberalism, progressive groups have been quietly urging the White House to nominate Wood, saying she also enjoys the support of conservative members of her court, and would be confirmable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood was born in 1950 in New Jersey, and as a teenager moved with her parents to Texas, where her father worked as an Exxon accountant. After finishing first in her class at Houston's Westchester High School, Wood had her choice of colleges, including the Ivy Leagues, but chose in-state University of Texas, mainly due to financial considerations. She was weeks from beginning graduate studies in literature at Yale when, on a whim, she pulled out and decided to take up law at UT, where her future husband was studying.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf nominated and confirmed to the high court, she would be the only person on that bench without an Ivy League law degree, and the only Protestant.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe clerked for Justice Harry Blackmun in 1976-77, just three years after he issued the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. She was one of only three female Supreme Court law clerks that year. She later worked as a government lawyer in the administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn between were brief stints in private practice and as a law professor at Georgetown and the University of Chicago, where she started in 1981 as the only full-time female faculty member. She later became associate dean and helped craft the school's first sexual harassment policy, which took several years to implement. \"You put your batting helmet on when you go to work for the University of Chicago,\" Wood said last year. \"It's a hard-hitting place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe retiring Justice John Paul Stevens also attended the school as an undergraduate, and Wood still teaches a class in civil procedure on a part-time basis. Students privately describe her courses as tough but very fair, and say Professor Wood is a knowledgeable, hands-on teacher and good listener.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwice divorced with three grown children, Wood is now married to a neurologist and lives in a Chicago suburb. Judge Richard Posner, a conservative member of the 7th Circuit and a close Wood friend, officiated at her 2006 wedding.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends describe her as keenly interested in world affairs, and she has traveled the globe extensively promoting American concepts of the rule of law. She has made international trade her legal specialty; she speaks French, German, and some Russian.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong her many interests are the oboe and French horn, and she is good enough to play in several area orchestras.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood's judicial record reflects a mainstream liberal jurisprudence, tempered by a respect for precedent and a narrow focus on the facts at hand. Absent are any detours into ideological rants and asides. In her 15 years on the court, she has often served as an intellectual counterweight to leading conservative judges Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner. She has written more than 50 dissents, and concurrences in dozens more. She became only the second woman at the time to sit on the 7th Circuit, recommended to the job by the late Sen. Paul Simon, D-Illinois.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many of the top contenders being considered by Obama, Wood has earned a reputation as a consensus-builder on her court.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer rulings on abortion have attracted the most criticism from conservatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 In 2002, she dissented from a court opinion upholding the constitutionality of an Indiana statute requiring women to wait 18 hours and receive counseling and additional information before obtaining an abortion (A Woman's Choice-East Side Women's Clinic vs. Newman, 2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 In 1999, she dissented from a ruling upholding the constitutionality of Illinois and Wisconsin statutes banning a late-term procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion (Hope Clinic vs. Ryan, 1999). The high court a year later affirmed her views, throwing out a similar restriction on the procedure in Nebraska.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 In 2001, Wood wrote the opinion upholding a lower court decision that applied anti-racketeering laws against a group of anti-abortion protesters. The case was reversed twice by the Supreme Court, 8-1 and 8-0. The only dissent by the high court in support of Wood's views was Stevens himself (National Organization for Women vs. Scheidler, 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\nWood has expressed admiration for her former boss's views on abortion. \"Justice Blackmun articulated in Roe,\" she wrote in a 1993 law review article, \"the important insight that a core set of individual rights exists that neither the states nor the federal government may trample.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHours after Stevens announced his retirement in April, abortion opponents made their intentions clear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A Wood nomination would return the abortion wars to the Supreme Court,\" Americans United for Life announced in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Judge Diane Wood would be a very polarizing and divisive nominee,\" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis network. \"She's got cases on abortion, the most extreme abortion cases out there, she's got some very difficult opinions just to square with the American people. And so she is pretty far out on the left. But if that is what the president wants to go for, we are ready for a fight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch-state disputes are another area that may cause difficulty if Wood is nominated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 She ruled against a church that claimed O'Hare International Airport's acquisition of church-owned land under eminent domain laws violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment (St. John's United Church of Christ vs. City of Chicago, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 She argued in a dissent that Indiana taxpayers had legal standing to challenge the legislative prayer practices in the Indiana General Assembly (Hinrichs vs. Speaker of the House, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 She issued a dissent in favor of allowing a public university to revoke the charter of a Christian student organization that refused membership to gays and lesbians (Christian Legal Society vs. Walker). The high court last month heard a similar case from the same group, over denial of official recognition by a California law school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in 2008, she dissented in a ruling allowing a condominium association to prevent a Chicago family from putting up a Jewish decoration on their doorpost. The Blochs challenged the rule against placing \"objects of any sort\" in the hallways. Mezuzahs are often placed on doors, and contain a small parchment with biblical sayings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood disagreed with the majority's conclusion the rule was neutral in respect to religion. In a long, detailed dissent, she wrote: \"The [condo] Association might as well hang a sign outside saying 'No Observant Jews Allowed.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also criticized the condo board for filing an appeal accusing the homeowners of trying to get a \"pound of flesh\" from the board. She noted the phrase comes from Shakespeare's \"Merchant of Venice,\" and refers to the shady actions of Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. \"This is hardly the reference someone should choose who is trying to show that the stand-off ... was not because of the Blochs' religion, but rather in spite of it.\" (Bloch v. Frischolz and Shoreline Towers Condominium Assn., 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazingly, because of her powerful dissent, the entire appeals court agreed to rehear the case and reversed unanimously, adopting Wood's original position.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2005 law school lecture also raised concerns from conservatives over her views on whether current courts should broadly interpret the original text of the Constitution, and the rights and privileges it confers on citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said of the framers of the 1789 document, \"There is no more reason to think that they expected the world to remain static than there is to think that any of us holds a crystal ball,\" she wrote. \"The only way to create a foundational document that could stand the test of time was to build in enough flexibility that later generations would be able to adapt it to their own needs and uses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany conservatives believe judges should adhere to the strict wording of the Constitution, and not try to read into rights that do not exist, such as, they contend, the \"right\" to an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood was interviewed by the president last year, a finalist for the high court seat that went to Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Colleagues privately say Wood was pleased with the rapport she established in the one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has given few media interviews over the years, and has been generally reticent about stating her views off the bench. When approached by CNN last year in Washington, where she had gone to meet Obama, Wood was polite but firm about her chances. \"I'm not answering anything on that,\" she said, smiling and apologizing she could not say more.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview last fall with her alumni magazine, Wood said, \"As a judge you don't campaign for such things. I'm in the luxurious position of knowing that the people who count know that I am here, and if they are interested, they'll let me know.\"",

  "context": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN) -- Five of Bolivia's nine states staged a civic strike Tuesday, protesting against President Evo Morales and demanding a larger share of the country's natural gas revenues.\n\n\n\nMembers of Santa Cruz's Juvenile Union burn wood during protests Tuesday in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.\n\n\n\nOfficials in Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija -- states in the wealthy, eastern lowland known as the \"Media Luna,\" or half-moon -- and Chuquisaca, also in the eastern part of the country, instructed residents not to leave their homes until the end of the one-day strike, Bolivian newspaper El Diario reported.\n\n\n\nThe five departments contain much of the Andean country's natural gas deposits, and their leaders are asking for natural gas revenue that Morales has earmarked to increase funding for pension plans, the five regions said in a statement on the strike posted on Santa Cruz's Web site.\n\n\n\nThey said they were \"sorry that the inflexibility of the government forced the prefectures to take this type of resolution.\"\n\n\n\nConfrontations between government supporters and pro-autonomy groups in a Santa Cruz neighborhood appeared to be the day's most violent. Police fired tear gas three times at demonstrators.\n\n\n\nIn the other four departments where the strike was being observed, there were no disturbances.\n\n\n\nThe 24-hour strike was called by civil committees of the departments to demand that the government give back the money it has collected by taxing hydrocarbons in order to fund the pension plan.\n\n\n\nThe president of Santa Cruz's civic committee, Branco Marincovick, said the tax is constraining regional development.\n\n\n\nThe government condemned acts of violence during the day and said that the strike was limited.\n\n\n\nThe strike comes nine days after Morales garnered more than 67 percent of votes in a recall referendum, which he had proposed in May to break a power struggle long simmering between him and the conservative leadership in the Media Luna states.\n\n\n\nDespite the solid show of support for Morales, the vote also endorsed the leaders in Santa Cruz, Pando, Beni and Tarija, making it impossible to reach a solution to the stalemate.\n\n\n\nMorales, a former labor organizer and the country's first indigenous president, was elected in 2005 on promises to reform Bolivia's constitution for the benefit of its indigenous majority.\n\n\n\nBut his proposals have been hampered by his rivals in the Media Luna states. Since taking office, all four have pushed for greater autonomy, saying the individual departments have the right to control their own affairs, including increased access to gas revenues.\n\n\n\nIn speaking about the revenues earmarked for increased pensions, Morales emphasized that it was for the good of the people, a refrain he often uses.\n\n\n\n\"Some authorities believe that this money is theirs, and it is not so, this silver is of the people and should benefit the people,\" the president said last year, shortly after he announced the measure.\n\n\n\nMark Weisbrot, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonpartisan think-tank, said Morales' overwhelming victory at the polls strengthens his hand at achieving his goal of redistributing wealth.\n\n\n\nLess than one percent of landowners in Bolivia own two-thirds of the country's farmland, he said in an article published in The Nation magazine.\n\n\n\n\"Bolivia is South America's poorest country, with 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line, and 38 percent in extreme poverty,\" he said. \"The voters have overwhelmingly decided that they want their government to do something about that. This should be possible, even if it means redistributing some of the country's most important natural resources.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Gloria Carrasco contributed to this report.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The largest mass transit project in the country got under way Monday with the help of federal stimulus dollars, as public officials broke ground on a second passenger rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\n\n\nWork on the country's largest mass transit project began Monday.\n\n\n\nThe new tunnel will link New Jersey with New York and eventually will double capacity on the nation's busiest rail corridor, running from Washington to Boston, Massachusetts, officials said.\n\n\n\nOfficials participated in the groundbreaking for the $8.7 billion project as commuter trains passed behind them in North Bergen, New Jersey, before entering the existing train tunnel, which went into operation in 1908.\n\n\n\n\"As we start digging this tunnel, I think that what really it means, we are digging our way out of an economic crisis,\" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey. \"As we're getting under way, we're seeing the dividends of the Recovery Act being paid right now.\"\n\n\n\nThe Department of Transportation announced Monday that it will commit $3 billion to the project over its lifespan. Of that, $130 million is coming from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the department said..\n\n\n\nIt is the largest commitment to any transportation project anywhere in the United States in the history of the Department of Transportation, according to administrator Peter Rogoff of the Federal Transportation Administration.\n\n\n\n\"This is what President Obama means by recovery. It means putting people back to work now to improve the lives of so many others for years to come,\" Rogoff said.\n\n\n\nThe project -- known as ARC, for Access to the Region's Core -- is expected to create 6,000 design and construction jobs.\n\n\n\n\"This is going to promote mobility, reduce commuter congestion, staunch carbon emissions, enhance regional competitiveness and lay a foundation for an extraordinary expansion of mass transit in the most densely populate state in the nation, New Jersey,\" New Jersey Gov. John Corzine said.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Transit says 170,000 passengers now travel through the existing train tunnel beneath the Hudson River to New York each day. When completed, the second tunnel will enable that figure to increase to 255,000 passenger trips. The additional passengers will disembark at a new concourse to be built at Penn Station in New York, 150 feet below street level.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Forests in the Pacific Northwest are dying twice as fast as they were 17 years ago, and scientists blame warming temperatures for the trend, according to a new study.\n\nThis photo of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado shows dying pines and firs among healthy trees.\n\nThe study, to be released Friday in the journal Science, is the first large-scale analysis of environmental changes as contributing factors in the mortality of coniferous forests.\n\nThe data for this research was gathered by generations of scientists over a 50-year period at multiple sites in Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and southwestern British Columbia. Seventy-six forest plots, all more than 200 years old, were monitored by scientists doing some of the most rudimentary research -- counting trees.\n\n\"It's not a happy story, but, an important one,\" said Phillip van Mantgem, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and the lead author of the study. \"These are beautiful places. They do change and respond to their environment, sometimes quickly.\"\n\n\"If in your hometown where you live, the death rates of your friends and neighbors doubled and there are no compensating birth rates, wouldn't you want to figure out what's going on?\" said Nathan Stephenson, research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and one of the authors of the report.\n\nThe study primarily focused on three types of coniferous trees: pines, firs and hemlocks. Older-growth forests -- some up to 500 years old -- have trees of all ages, and researchers found that mortality rates have increased for all age groups. Since mortality rates went up across the board, scientists ruled out a number of other possible causes, including ozone-related air pollution, long-term effects of fire suppression and normal forest dynamics.\n\nIn the end, California had the highest tree death rate. Of the three types of coniferous trees studied, pines were found to be dying at the fastest rate. Ultimately, higher tree mortality may lead to significant shifts in forest structure and function, the report states.\n\n\"Much of the world's population in North America, Europe, most of China and large portions of Russia live near temperate forests, so what happens in these forests has global importance,\" said Jerry Franklin, a professor of forest resources at the University of Washington whose work was instrumental in maintaining the research plots.\n\n\"My guess is that forest loss has the potential to greatly exceed forest establishment,\" he added.\n\nThe new findings concern scientists who see the study as further confirmation of the harmful effects of climate change on ecosystems.\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific intergovernmental body, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now at their highest levels for at least 650,000 years. Scientists on the panel say the increase began with the birth of the Industrial Revolution 250 years ago.\n\nThe new research also suggests that as trees die, they actually emit more carbon than they absorb. Trees are key players in regulating climate because they convert carbon dioxide, which they store in their trunks and roots, to oxygen. Changes in climatic conditions or various diseases can cause the gradual dying of plant shoots.\n\n\"The concern here is that these might be early warning signs of dieback,\" said Stephenson.\n\nSome scientists say that tree species unable to tolerate warmer conditions might just re-establish themselves in cooler areas. Given the speed at which warming appears to be occurring, it's not clear whether tree species will be able to migrate fast enough to survive, said van Mantgem of the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n\"Warmer temperatures cause earlier summer droughts, less snow pack, and cause ideal breeding grounds for invasive species and pathogens,\" he added.\n\n\"One hypothesis is that warmer climates can make it easier for invasive species to reproduce and grow in these temperate forests. If the trees are already under a lot of environmental stress, they are more prone to serious insect attack,\" he said.\n\nScientists say forests in the Western U.S. have been increasingly damaged in recent years by invasive insect species such as the bark beetle -- a sign that rising temperatures are having an adverse effect. Bark beetles are known to attack trees already weakened by other environmental factors.\n\n\"Many of these beetles cannot survive in cold temperatures, and it's getting warmer,\" said Tim Barnett, a \u00adresearch marine physicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Barnett authored a research paper linking drought conditions in the American West to increased human activity.\n\n\"It is perfectly reasonable to assume that this problem is going to get worse, not better,\" he said.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A U.S. soldier convicted of rape and murder two decades ago will be executed December 10 in the nation's first military execution since 1961, the Army said Thursday.\n\n\n\nPvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, since 1988. A court-martial panel sitting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the Fayetteville, North Carolina, area, and sentenced him to death.\n\n\n\nGray's execution by injection will be carried out by Fort Leavenworth soldiers at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, the Army said in a news release.\n\n\n\nGray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg. He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post.\n\n\n\nBoth military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes, which were committed between April 1986 and January 1987. Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms.\n\n\n\nThe general court-martial at Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders, an attempted murder and three rapes.\n\n\n\nIn July, President George W. Bush approved the Army's request to execute Gray.\n\n\n\n\"The president took action following completion of a full appellate process, which upheld the conviction and sentence to death,\" the Army said in the news release. \"Two petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied during the appellate processing of Pvt. Gray's case.\"\n\n\n\nMembers of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history, but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the military's modern-day legal system.\n\n\n\nThe Army also sought Bush's authorization to execute another condemned soldier, Pvt. Dwight Loving, who was convicted of robbing and killing two cab drivers in 1988.\n\n\n\nThe last U.S. military execution was in 1961, when Army Pvt. John Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11-year-old Austrian girl. Bennett was sentenced in 1955.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. military hasn't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since President John F. Kennedy commuted a death sentence in 1962. Nine men are on military death row.\n\n\n\nCNN's Mike Mount contributed to this report.",

Seven U.S. troops also died when their helicopter went down in western Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe military transport that landed in Delaware also included the bodies of eight U.S. soldiers killed Tuesday when their vehicles were hit by roadside bombs in two incidents in southern Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers were from the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team of the 2nd Infantry Division, based at Fort Lewis, Washington.\n\n\n\nThe DEA identified the agents killed Monday as Forrest N. Leamon, 37, of Woodbridge, Virginia; Chad L. Michael, 30, of Quantico, Virginia; and Michael E. Weston, 37, of Washington.\n\n\n\nLeamon and Michael were members of the DEA's Foreign-deployed Advisory and Support Teams, and Weston was assigned to the agency's Kabul office.\n\n\n\nCNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.",

  "context": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- An internationally known Catholic priest who was shown in photographs last week embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman on a Florida beach has admitted they had a two-year affair.\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman.\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called \"Father Oprah\" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' \"Early Show\" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said.\n\n\n\nThe priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,\" he said Monday.\n\n\n\nThe photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as \"Padre Alberto,\" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: \"Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover.\"\n\n\n\nOther media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\n\nIn a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a \"scandal.\"\n\n\n\n\"Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,\" Favalora said. \"Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest.\"\n\n\n\nCutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program.\n\n\n\n\"I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,\" Cutie said.\n\n\n\nThe priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,\" Cutie said. \"I understand fully that this is wrong.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,\" he said. \"I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate.\"\n\n\n\nHe also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have \"both struggled\" with the relationship, he said.\n\n\n\n\"She's also a woman of faith,\" Cutie said. \"She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy. Obviously, you know, through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that.\"\n\n\n\nCutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his TV and radio appearances, he has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, \"Real Life, Real Love.\"\n\n\n\nBefore being removed, he was president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace in Miami.",

Stancza had been based there for a Polish survey company searching for natural gas.\n\n\n\nLocal reports and TV station Dawn News reported Stancza's execution Saturday.\n\n\n\nPolish Embassy spokesman Peter Adams said his offices were aware of local media reports but were waiting to hear officially from Pakistani authorities. He said all efforts had been made by Polish authorities to pressure the Pakistani government to do whatever it could to secure Stancza's release.\n\n\n\n\"From the Polish side, we did whatever we could, pressuring the Pakistani government on the presidential and prime minister level,\" Adams said. \"Problem was, this was solely Pakistan's responsibility. Demands were only towards [the] Pakistan government.\"\n\n\n\nAdams said there had been no demands for ransom. The Taliban had demanded the release of Taliban prisoners being held by the government and a pullout of government security forces from the tribal areas.\n\n\n\nAlthough there were assurances that the Pakistani government was doing everything it could and that Stancza would be freed soon, Adams said it was never clear what the government was actually doing to secure his release.\n\n\n\n\"We are waiting for confirmation and waiting for any answer [about] how this happened and why did this happen,\" Adams said.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Pakistan's interior ministry said that the reports of Stancza's death have yet to be confirmed and that the case of his kidnapping was a high priority for the government. Shahid Ullah Baig said the government had been working hard to retrieve Stancza unharmed but did not give details.\n\n\n\n\"The Pakistan government is doing its level best to secure his release,\" he said, adding, \"Human life is more important to us than anything else.\"\n\n\n\nKidnappings and attacks against foreigners have risen sharply in recent months throughout the country. Most recently, an American working for the United Nations was kidnapped in Quetta, and Peshawar has been the scene of various attacks against foreign diplomats and journalists.",

Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken.\n\n\n\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.\n\n\n\nThe rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.\n\n\n\nIt had been in rebel hands for more than nine years.\n\n\n\nThe recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.\n\n\n\n\"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had.\"\n\n\n\nDespite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict.\n\n\n\n\"This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk,\" Elder said.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations is \"calling on the ... Tamil Tigers to meet their international responsibilities and guarantee that these very large civilian populations to move freely and then can move away from the conflict and to areas where they can receive appropriate assistance,\" Elder said.\n\n\n\n\"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he said in a Sunday interview. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\"\n\n\n\nSri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place.\n\n\n\nAmnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\"\n\n\n\nThe organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict.\n\n\n\n\"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Sri Lankan authorities \"are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAt least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.\n\n\n\nOthers have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.",

The IED (improvised explosive device) craters in the road and the bullet holes in our unarmed pickup trucks explained why. The direct fighting had stopped some days before, after opposition forces were reported killed or they disappeared into the surrounding hills and among the population.\n\n\n\nUnder the watchful eye of government forces, anxious local residents were starting to return. A Pakistani army spokesperson now tells us that all of those who fled the town due to the fighting have returned home.\n\n\n\nThey have a lot of rebuilding to do. Most of the structures we saw had some kind of damage to them from bullets or direct hits from artillery fire.\n\n\n\nOne person who will likely not be returning anytime soon is the pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Muhammad, who brokered a short-lived deal between the Taliban and the government that allowed the Taliban to enforce Sharia law in the Swat Valley. But the deal collapsed and the government set off this offensive.\n\n\n\nSufi Muhammad was arrested in Peshawar in late July, accused of encouraging violence.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Walking into school Wednesday morning was not easy for Constance McMillen. The last time she'd been there was March 11, the day after her Fulton, Mississippi, high school canceled prom rather than allow her to wear a tuxedo and attend with her girlfriend.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe didn't assume last week's spring break would cool things down. She expected stares, dirty looks and cold shoulders, and passing through the doors was daunting. Over these last two weeks, she said, she's had a hard time sleeping, can barely eat, feels anxious and -- until she saw a doctor for help -- often felt like she was \"going to throw up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been very nervous about all of this,\" the 18-year-old Itawamba Agricultural High School senior said. \"I don't like being somewhere where everyone hates me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcMillen's name made national headlines when she, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, filed suit against her school and the Itawamba County School District, asking them to reinstate prom for everyone, without discrimination. A federal judge in Mississippi ruled Tuesday that while he wouldn't force the school to have a prom, which had originally been scheduled for April 2, he agreed that McMillen's First Amendment rights had been violated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was good news, said her attorney, Christine Sun, senior counsel with the ACLU's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender project. It set a precedent and helped broadcast an important statement, which was made stronger by virtue of where it came from, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're in a conservative area of the country, where people tend to think we can do what we like,\" said Sun, who lives in New York but has traveled multiple times to Mississippi for this legal push. \"This case sends a strong message that that's not going to fly anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only pending issue, Sun said, is the question of damages and the ACLU's request for attorneys' fees. An amended complaint to seek a quick resolution on this should be filed in the next 30 days, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeantime, McMillen is trying to find her new normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, she stands in an awkward balance. Though there are some people who support her in Fulton (population about 4,000), the overarching tension and what she described as \"hostility\" that she feels at school and in her community is in deep contrast to the reception and groundswell of support that's overwhelmed her nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a poster child for the rights of LGBT students, she's been asked to jump on airplanes to appear on news programs and talk shows. The Facebook fan page \"Let Constance Take Her Girlfriend to Prom!\" had attracted more than 414,000 fans as of Friday morning. Wealthy individuals, including Ellen DeGeneres, have offered to pay for a prom for her school. She's received a $30,000 college scholarship from an anonymous donor and Tonic.com, a digital media company in New York that's also offered her a summer internship. She's even been invited to high school proms in cities she's never visited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It means a lot to me,\" she said of the outreach from others. \"The amount of support helps me to continue with the fight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut all McMillen, who came out as a lesbian in eighth grade, ever wanted was to go to her school prom with her class, and with her girlfriend. Going to another school's prom, while a nice offer, doesn't make any sense to her.\n\n\n\n\n\nParents at her school are reportedly planning a \"ball\" for the same night that prom was intended. McMillen said she's still trying to find out if she's free to attend with her girlfriend. She won't go otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe never meant to be a spoiler for others when she sought approval to bring her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo, she said. She thought she was doing the right thing by asking in advance, since the school had stipulated in a February memo that dates must be of the opposite sex. Rather than give her permission, the school canceled the prom.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcMillen said she's learning who her \"true friends\" are. They're the ones who respect her for taking a stance, defend her when others talk trash about her, don't turn their backs when she approaches and aren't afraid to be seen with her. Her girlfriend, too, has remained a constant support, even though she herself hasn't gone public. McMillen also said she's blessed to have family members who shore her up even if they don't all feel comfortable with her sexual orientation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My grandmother doesn't believe in it [same-sex relationships] but still stands behind me no matter what,\" McMillen said, her southern drawl thick. \"She's a conservative Christian but respects that it's my life. She doesn't think discrimination of any kind is right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether she intended to or not, McMillen has inspired others -- not just nationally but in her home state, said Izzy Pellegrine, 19, a student at Mississippi State University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I thought for a long time I was the only gay person in the state of Mississippi,\" said Pellegrine, who came out at 15 and went to high school about 1\u00bd hours from where McMillen lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcMillen's actions speak for others who feel unable to speak for themselves, said Pellegrine, who's a founding board member of the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition, which helped connect McMillen with the ACLU. The grass-roots organization seeks to protect the interests of LGBT youth and will host a \"second chance prom\" on May 8, an event Pellegrine estimated may attract as many as 500 students, thanks in large part to the way McMillen's fight empowers others.\n\n\n\n\n\nHear stories of others helped by the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Usually Mississippi is 10 or 20 years behind,\" Pellegrine said. \"For Mississippi to be spearheading the LGBT student movement is unheard of.  I, personally, and my co-workers are so proud to have it happen in our state,\" where \"queer flight,\" the compulsion to leave as soon as one is able, is rampant, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for where life will take McMillen after graduation, she isn't yet sure. She's still thinking about that summer internship offer in New York and is pretty certain she'll attend Itawamba Community College for a couple years before going to one of her dream schools, the University of Southern Mississippi or UCLA. What she does know is she'd like to study and possibly pursue a career in psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I like helping people, and I like talking to people about their problems,\" she said. \"I find the human mind and human behavior very interesting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSoledad O'Brien of CNN's \"In America\" unit will file an extended report on gay teens in the \"Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition,\" the group that was key in connecting Constance McMillen to her ACLU legal team. The story is expected to air in late May or early June.",

  "context": "BETHESDA, Maryland (CNN) -- Josh Winston is a self-described problem solver. From his spacious office on the seventh floor of a high-rise building in Bethesda, Maryland, he fills out tax returns and keeps the books balanced for a number of his accounting clients.\n\n\n\nJosh Winston stands outside the 1983 RV he was converting to run on vegetable oil.\n\n\n\n\"Everything on the left always equals everything on the right. For math-oriented people and musicians like me, that's very satisfying,\" he says.\n\n\n\nFour years ago, Winston was watching a late-night news program and saw a segment about converting diesel vehicles to run on alternative fuels. That night, Winston was hooked. He ordered a conversion kit for $900 and proceeded to convert a truck to run on used vegetable oil -- just to see if he could.\n\n\n\nSoon after, he converted his 1998 Jetta and affixed a sticker to the rear bumper that said, \"This vehicle runs on straight vegetable oil.\"\n\n\n\n\"For a single bumper sticker, I was surprised at how many people stopped me and said, 'Hey, how do you do that?' \"\n\n\n\nBefore taking on his first conversion, he hadn't worked on a car since his 1978 Plymouth Volare -- which he drove in college.\n\n\n\nBy Winston's estimate, there are fewer than 10,000 vehicles on the road that have undergone these diesel conversions. Now, he sells and installs his own kits -- and he's the only person in the Washington, D.C., area to offer the service.\n\n\n\nThough his side business, named \"Feed My Wheels dot com,\" has only converted a handful of vehicles, he recently took on his largest project by far -- a 1983 Itasca RV.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of trial and error,\" says Winston.  Watch the \"problem solver\" at work \u00bb\n\n\n\nOver the course of two days, Winston ran into many a problem. First, the batteries kept dying. Later, there was an issue with the alternator. By the end of Day 2, as Winston was preparing to fill a 40-gallon veggie-oil tank in the RV with recycled oil from a Chinese food restaurant, a neighbor watching him tipped over an 80-gallon holding tank, spilling tens of gallons of brown, smelly oil down his street.\n\n\n\n\"It's OK,\" Winston quipped, \"earthworms love this stuff.\"\n\n\n\nAfter nearly 50 hours of cutting and reattaching hoses, Winston managed to get the RV running and successfully switched over to the vegetable oil tank. He claims that veggie-oil emissions are about half of those of petroleum-based diesel fuel.\n\n\n\n\"If you're emitting half the carbon dioxide that our neighbor is, that means one of two things: Either your neighbor can drive twice as much, or you're having a significant positive impact on the environment,\" Winston says. \"In some small way, we're contributing to saving the environment. It's going to save a glacier somewhere.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Sonia, a single mother with HIV in Brazil, travels four hours to reach a government-run health facility that provides her with free drug treatment.\n\n\n\nBrazil's response to the HIV/AIDS fight has been widely praised and adopted as a model around the world.\n\n\n\nThe journey is long, she told CNN, but it's a small price to pay for the government-provided drugs that have helped keep her out of the hospital for the past 11 years.\n\n\n\nSonia is just one of the many Brazilians who have benefited from the country's novel approach to fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\n\n\nBrazil jolted the global health community in 1996 when it began guaranteeing free anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.\n\n\n\nFor Sonia, government-funded treatment comes in the form of 20 pills. Taken daily, the anti-retroviral medicine has helped keep her HIV at bay.\n\n\n\nCoupled with government-supported prevention efforts and aggressive public awareness campaigns, the so-called Brazilian response has been hailed as a model for developing countries.\n\n\n\nWatch a report on Brazil's pioneering response to HIV/AIDS \u00bb\n\n\n\nPrevention campaigns, which often take the forms of candid public awareness ads with slogans like \"Be good in bed, use a condom,\" have resulted in widespread knowledge of HIV.\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent study conducted by the country's Ministry of Health, Brazil boasts one of the highest rates of knowledge globally when it comes to HIV avoidance and transmittal.\n\n\n\nBrazil was \"the first country to realize there is no separation between prevention and treatment,\" Mauro Schechter, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told CNN.\n\n\n\nSchechter, who has studied the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1989, said it took the rest of the global health community some 15 years to realize that the two go hand-in-hand.\n\n\n\nOther countries that have adopted the Brazilian model \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe comprehensive response has extended the lives of tens of thousands of Brazilians and saved the government billions, researchers estimate.\n\n\n\nA recent study published by researchers from Brown University and the Harvard School of Public Health said that Brazil has saved $1 billion alone by producing its own generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines and negotiating discounts for imported drugs.\n\n\n\nThose drug savings come on top of the estimated $2 billion the program has saved Brazil in hospital costs between 1996 and 2004.\n\n\n\nBrazil's efforts to reverse the tide of the AIDS epidemic have become the object of admiration in the global health community, but the trailblazer is encountering new challenges.\n\n\n\nWhen Brazil decided to guarantee free anti-retrovirals, there were 10,000 people being treated and it was organized as a program to treat a small amount of people for a limited amount of time, according to Schechter.\n\n\n\nPatients are living longer and oftentimes able to get their disease under control, thanks to combination therapies, better known as drug cocktails. But that means they also require drug treatment for a longer period of time.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, as HIV has evolved from an acute illness into a chronic disease, patients have also become vulnerable to other health risks and medical conditions.\n\n\n\nValdileia Veloso is the director of the Institute of Clinical Research at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public health research institution in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\nShe told CNN patients are presenting with complications of chronic HIV and AIDS, which requires new treatment. \"It's a new challenge for us,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHeart disease is one of the big problems that doctors are encountering. While there's a system in place to prevent people from dying from HIV, preventable causes like heart conditions are causing deaths.\n\n\n\n\"These people are dying from preventable causes,\" Schechter told CNN.\n\n\n\nWhile Brazil has shown that providing universal access to treatment can be achieved, it needs to modify its approach to treat the evolving disease, he said. \"If the epidemic changes face, you need to adapt.\"",

  "context": "CLOVIS, California (CNN) -- Jeff Hubbard fought back tears as he talked about his boy -- a \"great, great young man\" who was killed last week in Iraq in a helicopter crash. It's the second time he's had to bury a son killed in the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nJeff and Peggy Hubbard with sons  Army Spc. Jason Hubbard, left, and Cpl. Nathan Hubbard.\n\n\n\nThis time, it was made even more tragic. His third son, also a soldier in Iraq, was immediately on the scene of last week's helicopter crash and watched as soldiers carried the remains of his brother, 21-year-old Army Cpl. Nathan Hubbard, from the crash site.\n\n\n\nNathan's flag-draped coffin arrived in Fresno earlier this week and eventually to his hometown of Clovis.  Watch \"We love you Nate\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nHundreds of mourners gathered Friday to remember Nathan at St. Anthony of Padua, the same church where his oldest brother's funeral was held in 2004. Nathan will be laid to rest at Clovis Cemetery, beside his brother, Jared.\n\n\n\nNathan and his other brother entered the military shortly after Jared was killed -- to honor his sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\"Their decision to join the military was motivated by a love for their brother and a desire to serve their country,\" the priest told mourners Friday. \"The death of Jared touched him deeply. Losing a brother and a friend made a profound impact on him, and brought to his attention the seasons of war and grief and loss.\"\n\n\n\nJeff Hubbard spoke to reporters Thursday ahead of the funeral, struggling to find words to describe how much his youngest son meant to him and his family.\n\n\n\n\"I want everybody to remember and celebrate Nate in their own way, the way they want,\" he said. \"We want him honored, remembered and celebrated -- he was a great, great young man. Wonderful young man.\"\n\n\n\nTragically, the Hubbards have gone through this anguish before.\n\n\n\nIn 2004 their son, Marine Lance Cpl. Jared Hubbard, was on patrol in Iraq with his best friend and fellow Marine, Jeremiah Baro -- also from Clovis -- when a roadside bomb exploded, killing both.\n\n\n\nJeff Hubbard says there's no way for a parent to prepare for the agony a second time.\n\n\n\n\"They're each absolutely individual terrible instances that you deal with the best you can as you go forward,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSix months after Jared was killed, Nathan and Jason Hubbard decided to enlist and serve together -- to follow in their brother's footsteps.\n\n\n\nOn August 22 after returning from a scouting mission south of Kirkuk, Iraq, the Blackhawk helicopter carrying Nathan and 13 other soldiers crashed.\n\n\n\nJason, who served in the same Army platoon, was in a separate helicopter when his brother went down and was ordered to secure the crash site.\n\n\n\nWhen he and his men reached the downed Blackhawk, Jason says he realized it was his brother's unit.\n\n\n\n\"We also had to remove as many of the men as we could out of that helicopter,\" Jason remembered. \"And I couldn't participate in that. I knew my -- I knew Nathan was in there. I tried several times to kind of gather myself, but I just -- I couldn't.\"\n\n\n\nJason says as the men carried bodies out of the wreckage, he spotted his younger brother. \"At one point they did carry Nathan by me. And that's when the reality, the complete reality, and complete understanding of the situation came to me and I began dealing with it.\"\n\n\n\nUnder the Department of Defense sole survivor policy, Jason says he was told he will not be allowed to return to war. His wife and young son will join him at his base in Hawaii.  E-mail to a friend",

The extent of his injuries was unclear, said the source, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to the media.\n\n\n\nThe explosion occurred about noon at the Bakaraha market, in one of the most dangerous areas of the city.\n\n\n\nThe interior minister is a popular moderate who led assaults against Ethiopian forces during their invasion of Somalia. Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006.\n\n\n\nThe Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year.\n\n\n\nThursday's attack on Ali Omar fueled concerns that moderate Islamists would strike out against the hardline Al-Shabab, which is suspected in the explosion.\n\n\n\nAl-Shabab -- which the United States has designated a terror organization -- warmly welcomed a recent call for the overthrow of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Somalia's new president.

  "context": "(CNN) -- An international footballer who played for the United Arab Emirates, and who became an internet sensation after scoring a backheeled penalty, has died following a car accident near the country's capital, Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheyab Awana, a 21-year-old winger for local club Bani Yas, was one of the country's brightest prospects after winning the 2008 AFC Under 18 Cup and was instrumental in the UAE reaching the quarterfinals of the 2009 FIFA Under 20 World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Theyab Awana has passed away on Sunday night after a horrible traffic accident on Sheikh Zayed Road in Abu Dhabi,\" the UAE Football Association confirmed in a statement on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"God blesses his soul and wholehearted condolences to his family, friends and fans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year he won a silver medal at the 2010 Asian Games after the UAE reached the final and had been picked for both senior and Olympic national teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was his actions during a friendly against Lebanon in July that brought him international recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the UAE leading 5-2, Awana stepped up to take a penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of conventionally striking the ball he twisted around and backheeled the ball into the corner of the net.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was immediately substituted by then coach Srecko Katanec, who was angry at what he saw was a lack of respect for the opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the fans didn't agree. Instead the YouTube clip of his penalty went viral. More than 1.2 million people have since viewed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On behalf of AFC and the Asian football family, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the UAE football community, family and friends of Awana,\" the Asian Football Confederation's acting president Zhang Jilong said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwana's death comes soon after another young Emirati player Saeed al Nooby, who played for second division side Al Dhafra, also died in a car accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had just returned last night with the club officials and players after visiting the family of Saeed al Nooby and paying our condolences,\" Bani Yas' Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira told the Dubai-based newspaper the Gulf News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An hour later I got a call from the club's manager informing me of the accident and I rushed to the hospital but Awana had died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will take some time for the club and his teammates to get over Awana's death.

  "context": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 35-year-old Florida man accused of being a \"hackerazzi\" pleaded not guilty Tuesday in federal court to charges of hacking into celebrities' e-mail accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida, is accused of hacking into e-mail accounts and devices belong to more than 50 people, including entertainers Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera, Mila Kunis, Simone Harouche and Renee Olstead, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Tuesday's arraignment in Los Angeles, the federal judge increased Chaney's bail to $110,000 from $10,000 in the wake of three new accusations of cyberstalking -- including one celebrity victim who wasn't identified and was allegedly cyberstalked after authorities seized Chaney's computer earlier this year. Two other victims, including a 13-year-old, have told authorities that they were cyberstalked before the computer seizure, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaney was expected to post bail after his mother indicated she would put up the family home as collateral. If he posts bail, Chaney will be subject to electronic monitoring and can't possess any computers, the judge said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge set a December 27 trial date.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaney allegedly accessed nude photos of some of the celebrities during the hacking, and a recently circulated nude photo of Johansson is part of the federal investigation, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaney also allegedly used public sources to mine data about his victims, which included both males and females, all associated with the entertainment industry, authorities said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities allege that once Chaney hacked into a celebrity's e-mail account, he would use the contact lists to find other celebrities' e-mail accounts. This allowed him to add new victims, authorities charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohansson told Vanity Fair magazine she is not ashamed of the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know my best angles,\" she said in an article published Tuesday. \"They were sent to my husband. ... There's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJohansson is now divorced from her husband at the time, Ryan Reynolds.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaney has been indicted on nine counts of computer hacking for gain, eight counts of aggravated identify theft and nine counts of illegal wiretapping, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf convicted of the 26 counts, Chaney would face a maximum of 121 years in federal prison, prosecutors said. The aggravated identity theft charge alone carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence, prosecutors added.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, Chaney said he became \"addicted\" to the intrusion and \"didn't know how to stop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I deeply apologize. I know what I did was probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience,\" Chaney told CNN affiliate WAWS/WTEV in Jacksonville, Florida, last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And these people don't have privacy to begin with. And I was in that little sliver of privacy they do have,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the interview, Chaney said the hacking \"started as curiosity and it turned into just being, you know, addicted to seeing the behind-the-scenes of what's going on with these people you see on the big screen every day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just happened and snowballed,\" he said, adding that he wishes it had never begun.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaney said he felt \"almost relieved months ago\" when authorities seized his computer because \"I didn't know how to stop doing it myself. I wasn't attempting to break into e-mails and get stuff to sell or purposely put it on the Internet. It just -- I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities allege that Chaney distributed photos of the celebrities that he obtained illegally and offered them to various celebrity blog sites, but he didn't seek money in exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the illegally obtained files, including private photographs, were ultimately posted online \"as a result of Chaney's alleged activities,\" authorities said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've had like six months to think about it,\" Chaney said, \"It eats at me... When you're doing it you're not thinking about what's going on with who you're doing it to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNET) -- Suleman Ali cashed out just in time.\n\nSuleman Ali sold Esgut, his portfolio of Facebook applications, for seven figures in April.\n\nThe 26-year-old, a former Microsoft employee who helped put together the Windows Home Server product, founded a company called Esgut within months of the debut of Facebook's developer platform in May 2007. Esgut is a portfolio of Facebook applications, and a few of them, like Superlatives and Entourage, became genuine viral hits.\n\nIn April, Ali sold the 12-employee Esgut to the Social Gaming Network, a Silicon Valley company backed by the likes of Bezos Expeditions, the Founders Fund, and Greylock Partners. He said the price was in the seven figures.\n\nBut Ali is the first to acknowledge that for upstart social-platform developers, hailed just months ago as the Valley's hottest breed of bright young things, the condition has taken a significant turn for the worse.\n\n\"Most people are not counting on anything,\" the lanky and bespectacled Ali said over lunch at an organic restaurant near New York's Union Square in early December. \"They're just operating from day to day.\"\n\nWhen Facebook's developer platform launched, the social network's traffic began to really skyrocket. What had started as a no-frills networking site for students at elite universities became a Silicon Valley buzz factory with legitimate geek credentials. And however gimmicky many of the most popular Facebook Platform apps were, millions of people decided they now had a reason to join the site. The floodgates had opened. Facebook was a phenomenon.\n\nWhen other social networks such as MySpace, Friendster, and Hi5 also paraded out developer platforms, the tech world took it as evidence that there was a big future in building platform applications. More importantly for developers and ambitious tech entrepreneurs, it looked like there could be gobs of money in it; the open, anyone-can-play attitude created the notion that there was enough for everyone.\n\n\"The social platform (on Facebook) actually launched the last day that I was at Microsoft...I was quitting without any idea of what I was going to do,\" Ali recalled. His aims for leaving Redmond were starry-eyed. \"I left because I wanted to do a start-up. I wanted to see what I could do out there on my own. And I wanted to care deeply about what I was working on.\"\n\nBut he had no concrete plans to go the Facebook route initially, he said. \"I ended up in my parents' house in Florida and was kind of bored, and started building Facebook apps just out of restlessness and the desire to do something.\"\n\nThen, Ali continued, he went to the Graphing Social Patterns West conference in San Diego in March and met Social Gaming Network founder Shervin Pishevar. At the time, he was looking to raise venture funding but hadn't thought about selling his apps. \"We talked for 30 minutes and he was like, 'You sound like the exact type of people we want at SGN.'\"\n\nAli sold Esgut to Pishevar's company the next month.\n\nWidgets buzz turns into hush\n\nAli got lucky. Even before the reality of the recession set in, the social-platform craze was subsiding. The venture capital buzz about widgets began to quiet over the summer. Some of the sillier novelty apps wore off in popularity. Companies that were snapping up small apps and raising huge amounts of venture capital, like Slide and RockYou, grew intimidatingly bigger--but the glut of independent apps made it more difficult to grab the attention of potential buyers.\n\nAnd after new restrictions, a redesign, and then the social network's focus on expanding through its Facebook Connect log-in service, it became evident that a social-network platform is still a new phenomenon that can change dramatically, and not always to the benefit of little start-ups.\n\n\"There's definitely a lot of tightening up,\" Ali said. \"There's a few people that I know that have apps that are relatively small, and they're selling them for valuations lower than what they could've sold them for a month ago, and there are just no buyers in the marketplace. I think they're going to have a hard time selling, period--forget trying to sell at a lower valuation. They're just having a hard time getting rid of them.\"\n\nSo would he still be able to sell his company as easily now? \"No, probably not,\" Ali admitted. \"If we were the same company we were then, it would be much harder to sell today. I think we would've had to evolve as a company. I think we would need to be generating more revenue than we were.\"\n\nBut for all his concern about the fate of social-platform developers in a recession, Ali is still strikingly bullish on Facebook--enough so that his newest project is a fund for Facebook stock. He started purchasing it in November, he said, and is meeting with investors in the hopes of purchasing more. He added with surprising gusto that Facebook's decision to delay direct cash-outs hasn't derailed his plan.\n\n\"I think that's actually good news for us,\" Ali said. \"I think that means that the price that we pay will actually go down because there are all these employees who intended to sell stock back to Facebook, and now they're not going to be able to sell it to Facebook, (so) they'll have to sell it somewhere else.\"\n\nHe hopes to keep the stock until Facebook files for an initial public offering, and he still thinks that's on track, too. \"I think it's going to be a function of the economy and when the markets open back up for an IPO,\" he said, and cited target dates that had been provided in interviews by Facebook investor and board member Jim Breyer. \"From a Facebook perspective, I think it'll be ready to IPO in 2011.\"\n\nMany critics would say that's wishful thinking, and that the company will sell--to existing investor Microsoft, maybe--for much lower than its $15 billion preferred-stock valuation.\n\nBut Ali got lucky on Facebook once already, and even in a recession he hasn't given up hope that it could happen again.\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2008 CBS Interactive Inc.

  "context": "(CNN) -- One hundred twenty African refugees -- most of them fleeing war-torn Somalia -- were forced overboard at gunpoint off the coast of Yemen, leaving at least 26 dead and 20 missing, the United Nations' refugee agency said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA Somali refugee walks past the United Nations-donated tents at a refugee camp west of Aden.\n\n\n\nSeventy-four survivors made it to the beach Tuesday and were taken to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees center in Ahwar, Yemen, according to UNHCR.\n\n\n\nSome told the United Nations that they were waiting on their boat for a smaller vessel to take them ashore when the smugglers operating the boat forced them overboard.\n\n\n\nSome were pushed and beaten, and others were shot and killed, for not complying, they said. The smaller boat never arrived, they said.\n\n\n\nHeavy fighting in Somalia's capital and a widespread drought has led to a dramatic increase in Somalis making the sometimes deadly journey by sea to Yemen, according to UNHCR.\n\n\n\nNearly 26,000 refugees have arrived on Yemen's shores this year from the Horn of Africa -- almost three times the number of refugees to make the perilous journey across the Gulf of Aden last year, according to UNHCR.\n\n\n\nYemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity. It is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country.\n\n\n\nNew smuggling routes, including some based out of Djibouti -- which lies north of Somalia and is much closer to Yemen -- have also led to the increase in refugees, according to the UNHCR.\n\n\n\nRefugees pay as much as $150 to get to Yemen on small fastboats, while others pay between $50 and $70 for a ride on larger and much slower vessels, the agency said.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline in an attempt to deter the smugglers. Some of the smuggling boats are seized by Yemen's coast guard and given to Somali fishermen who suffered losses in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\n\n\nAs part of a $19 million operation, UNHCR operates shelters and reception centers for the refugees in Yemen and has increased its efforts to discourage people from making the illegal crossing to Yemen. It has also sponsored training programs for coast guard personnel and other officials.",

  "context": "CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Suzanne Hagelof and Iris Botros dreamed of adopting babies. Separately, they visited orphanages in Egypt. Hagelof adopted a child, and Botros was in the process of adopting twins, when they ran foul of authorities. Now they are in jail, accused of being part of a conspiracy to traffic children.\n\n\n\nIris Botros and her husband, Luis Andros, are accused of trying to smuggle twins out of Egypt.\n\n\n\nLast week, the two women were led into a Cairo courtroom in handcuffs, along with six other people. They stood in a big black cage in the courtroom, looking apprehensive amid the hubbub.\n\n\n\nTo their defenders, all they were trying to do was provide orphans with a better chance in life. To the prosecution, they were involved in forging documents to try to adopt children illegally and smuggle them out of the country.\n\n\n\nAlong with the two American women, the accused include their husbands, two doctors, a nun who ran an orphanage, and an Egyptian banker. Watch the women get bundled into court \u00bb\n\n\n\nA year ago, Hagelof, a U.S. citizen who lives in Egypt with her husband, adopted a child from an orphanage run by the Coptic Christian Church, a religious minority in Egypt. She says no money changed hands.\n\n\n\nSeveral months later, Luis Andros, a U.S. citizen who is originally from Greece, and his wife, Iris Botros, left their restaurant business in North Carolina for Egypt. Botros, who is originally from Egypt, visited another orphanage run by the church. She paid the orphanage about $4,600 for the twins -- partly for clothes and partly as a donation.\n\n\n\nBoth women wanted to take the children to the United States -- in Hagelof's case for a visit, but in Botros' case to begin a new life in Wake Forest, North Carolina. And that's where the trouble began.\n\n\n\nTo get a visa for the children, both women went to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. According to their attorneys, the documents they presented included birth certificates and certificates signed by doctors stating they were the natural mothers.\n\n\n\nAccording to defense attorneys, the two women knew they were using forged documents.\n\n\n\nEmbassy officials became suspicious of the documents -- partly because the women seemed too old to be the mothers. Both Hagelof and Botros are in their mid- to late forties.\n\n\n\nThe embassy contacted Egyptian authorities, and both Hagelof and Botros -- along with their husbands -- were arrested soon afterward, as was a nun from a Coptic orphanage and a banker who allegedly helped Botros make contact with the nun. Also arrested were two doctors who had written the certificates for the three infants, all of whom are now at an orphanage not affiliated with the church.\n\n\n\nNeither the U.S. Embassy nor the U.S. State Department will comment on the case, citing the ongoing trial.\n\n\n\nBotros' husband, Andros, blames the embassy for their plight. Asked through the bars of the courtroom cage what had happened, he replied, \"Well, our American Embassy, instead of helping the people, they put them in jail.\"\n\n\n\nHis wife interjected, insisting they would not get a fair trial. A few feet away, Suzanne Hagelof called out, \"We want to tell our story,\" while her husband, Medhat, looked on, quiet and dejected. As reporters tried to talk to the defendants, a guard intervened, shouting \"Sit down, sit down.\"\n\n\n\nAdoption has long been illegal under Egyptian law as well as being forbidden under sharia, Muslim religious law. Fostering is legal but uncommon.\n\n\n\nIt has become a high-profile issue since Suzanne Mubarak, wife of the president, embarked on a campaign to stamp out human trafficking. She recently told CNN that human trafficking \"exists in all societies.\"\n\n\n\n\"I came to realize what an insidious crime this was and how it was just really built on profit. On not only low morals, on no morals at all,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAnd that's how the prosecution seems to be framing this case, using a law passed last year that provides for tough penalties for human trafficking. Khalil Adil El Hamani, the attorney representing Hagelof, says Egyptian authorities want to prove that all the defendants are from one gang and are trafficking children, so as to make the case seem to be a giant conspiracy.\n\n\n\nBoth couples insist they had no idea what they were doing was illegal and have no link with human trafficking. The attorney representing Botros and her husband says their only crime was to dream of being parents.\n\n\n\n\"They are now are in jail because of this dream,\" he told CNN after the first hearing in the case a week ago. \"They never thought that they will be in jail. They thought that they are going to adopt only. They didn't think they are making something against the law in Egypt.\"\n\n\n\nAll eight defendants remain in jail -- the men at the Tora prison in Cairo, well known for its overcrowding. The next stage of the trial takes place May 16, and proceedings could last six to eight months. If they are convicted, the accused could each face up to 10 years in prison.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Honey has been used to treat wounds since ancient times, but recent years have seen a surge of medical interest in the sticky stuff.\n\n\n\nResearch has shown that honey has antibacterial properties.\n\n\n\nManuka honey has been the subject of particular interest, with the results of a study just published by Sydney University finding that it has powerful antibacterial properties, and is even effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Dee Carter, from Sydney University's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences said: \"Our research is the first to clearly show that these honey-based products could in many cases replace antibiotic creams on wounds and equipment such as catheters. Using honey as an intermediate treatment could also prolong the life of antibiotics.\"\n\n\n\n\"Most bacteria that cause infections in hospitals are resistant to at least one antibiotic, and there is an urgent need for new ways to treat and control surface infections.\"\n\n\n\nShe added: \"We don't quite know how these honeys prevent and kill infections, but a compound in them called methylglyoxal seems to interact with a number of other unknown compounds in honey to prevent infectious bacteria developing new strains that are resistant to it.\"\n\n\n\nHoney is a complex substance, containing up to 800 compounds and its complexity means it has been difficult to pinpoint exactly how it kills bacteria.\n\n\n\nManuka is a type of honey that is made by bees pollinating the flowers of the Manuka bush, a member of the Leptospermum family that grows naturally in New Zealand.\n\n\n\nNow, an Australian company is claiming to have produced the world's most potent medical-grade antibacterial honey, made by bees pollinating the Australian jellybush, also a member of the Leptospermum family.\n\n\n\nAustralia's Medi Bioactive Honey Company claims its Berringa antibacterial honey has twice the antibacterial content of normal manuka honey, and has launched the product in the UK.\n\n\n\nDr Rose Cooper of the University of Wales Cardiff School of Health Sciences has researched honey's antibacterial action and has written a book called \"Honey in Modern Wounds Management.\"\n\n\n\nCooper told CNN that there are many components in honey that contribute to its antibacterial nature. She says its high sugar content, low water content and low pH are all factors. Additionally, some honey produces hydrogen peroxide, which can kill bacteria.\n\n\n\nSince 2004, Britain's National Health Service has licensed the use of manuka-honey wound dressings and sterilized medical grade manuka-honey creams.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Organization of American States suspended Honduras late Saturday because the nation's new leaders refused to reinstate ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya.\n\n\n\nOusted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\n\nZelaya was removed by the military on June 28 and flown to Costa Rica. Congressional leader Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as provisional president later that day.\n\n\n\nThe OAS set a Saturday deadline for Honduras to return Zelaya to power or be suspended from the 35-nation hemispheric organization. Honduran officials told OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza on Friday that they would not allow Zelaya to return to power.\n\n\n\nThousands of protesters demanding the return to power of ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya pushed through riot police at Tegucigalpa's airport and surrounded the terminal Saturday, but there were no reports of violence.\n\n\n\nThe airport continued to operate, CNN Correspondent Karl Penhaul reported.\n\n\n\nZelaya, a leftist who took office in 2006, says he will return to Honduras on Sunday. Micheletti has vowed to have Zelaya arrested if he returns.\n\n\n\n\"I am simply defending a system,\" Zelaya told the OAS delegates early Sunday, after the 33-0 vote to suspend Honduras.\n\n\n\nAmong the delegates were two heads of state: Presidents Christina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay.\n\n\n\n\"I am here not only as president of the republic of Argentina, but also as part of a delegation who was the object of coups in Argentina,\" Fernandez said.\n\n\n\nLugo also spoke in favor of restoring Zelaya and democracy to his nation.\n\n\n\n\"I come from Paraguay, a country that has had the long night of dictatorships,\" Lugo said. \"I come here with a pain, but also with a hope.\"\n\n\n\nMicheletti repeated in an interview with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Saturday night that a coup did not take place. What happened, he said, was a constitutional transfer of power authorized by the nation's congress.\n\n\n\nBut Micheletti is swimming against world opinion.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly condemned the coup last week and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated.\n\n\n\nThe European Union and other nations have recalled their ambassadors from Honduras, and the United States and the World Bank have suspended some aid.\n\n\n\nHonduran officials have said the Central American nation was prepared to withdraw from the OAS rather than reinstate Zelaya.\n\n\n\n\"If the Organization of American States doesn't deem Honduras worthy of membership of the Organization of American States, then Honduras would renounce with immediate effect the inter-American charter,\" said Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Lorena Alvarado.\n\n\n\nAt the center of the dispute was a referendum Zelaya had vowed to carry out even after the country's supreme court and congress found it illegal. The nonbinding referendum could have led to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country's charter to allow the president to run for re-election.\n\n\n\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a Zelaya ally, won a similar referendum this year, and many Hondurans thought Zelaya was trying to maneuver a way to seek re-election in November. Zelaya has denied that was his intent.\n\n\n\nZelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005, with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio \"Pepe\" Lobo.\n\n\n\nAfter 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule, Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981. Since then, the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people, about 70 percent of whom live in poverty.\n\n\n\nMilitary interventions were once common in Latin America, but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s. Before Sunday, the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement.\n\n\n\nCNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Strange lights in the sky, mysterious flashes, dozens of witnesses, a missing wind turbine blade and a tabloid splash featuring the pun: E.T. farm harm.\n\n\n\nThe Sun tabloid newspaper's UFO splash.\n\n\n\nLet's hope there isn't intelligent life out there watching us.\n\n\n\nBritain's tabloid Sun newspaper Thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a UFO hit one of its 20 meter-long blades in Conisholme, Lincolnshire.\n\n\n\nDorothy Willows, who lives near the damaged turbine, told The Sun she was in her car when she saw strange lights in the sky.\n\n\n\n\"The lights were moving across the sky towards the wind farm. Then I saw a low flying object. It was skimming across the sky towards the turbines.\"\n\n\n\nApparently, hours later, she and her husband were woken by a big bang; one of the turbine's three blades had gone.\n\n\n\nIt, was, however, on the ground below.\n\n\n\nOther locals told the newspaper that the lights looked like \"balls of flames.\"\n\n\n\nRuss Kellett, a UFO expert, told the newspaper: \"Balls of light were seen in the sky and the MoD [Ministry of Defence] has no explanation. It must have taken a pretty massive object. We are very, very, very excited.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, The Guardian newspaper's Web site content director Emily Bell had a simple explanation for all those \"balls of light\" in the sky.\n\n\n\nShe told The Guardian the lights were fireworks her brother Tim had bought at the local garden center for the 80th birthday party of dad Peter Bell.\n\n\n\n\"It was a medium-sized fireworks display with absolutely no ballistics, and the fireworks were mostly dropping over my parents' house. But we were laughing that we could have broken the wind turbine,\" Emily said.\n\n\n\n\"There we are in the middle of a scoop and we're beaten to it by a red-top tabloid,\" Emily's mother Bridget, 74, told The Guardian.\n\n\n\nLater Thursday, the British Press Association reported the blade may have come off after a mechanical failure.\n\n\n\nFraser McLachlan, chief executive of GCube, which insures more than 25,000 wind turbines worldwide, told PA that although it was unusual, this kind of incident happened up to six times a year.\n\n\n\n\"It does happen that a blade will sometimes just come off a machine for one reason or another,\" he said. \"The main reason is the blade may shear. \"We don't normally see things like aircraft -- or UFOs -- hitting them. It's usually a mechanical failure that causes the blade to separate from the main hub.\"\n\n\n\nHe said the cold weather was another possible cause.\n\n\n\nDr Peter Schubel, an expert in the design and manufacture of wind turbine blades at the University of Nottingham, agreed.\n\n\n\nHe told the BBC that if the turbine blade was still, it would take a 10-tonne load to remove a blade, but if it was rotating the force could be a lot less.\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely not a bird. It could be ice thrown from a neighbouring turbine that struck it.\"\n\n\n\nAliens out of control or simple mechanical failure? A case for Mulder and Scully? What do you think?",

The photographer caught the incident while covering a marathon in Austin.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, the FAA told pilots through its routine notification system that \"a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the earth's atmosphere.\" The notice did not specify a time or location.  Watch video of meteor-like fireball \u00bb\n\n\n\nHerwig said most of the reports the FAA received came in about midday Sunday in an area of Texas from Dallas south to Austin. iReport.com: Did you see the fireball? Send photos, video\n\n\n\nHe said he was not certain where the information that sparked the FAA notification came from, but it was \"probably from NORAD,\" or the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which tracks man-made objects in space. Calls to NORAD headquarters in Colorado were not immediately returned.\n\n\n\nLisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said her agency had received calls from residents surprised by sonic booms about 11 a.m. She said calls came from an area from Dallas to Houston.\n\n\n\nLast week, the Russian and U.S. space agencies said two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided about 496 miles (800 kilometers) above Siberia, Russia.\n\n\n\nThe collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds, NASA said. The satellites collided at 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) per second, producing 500 to 600 pieces of space debris, the U.S. Strategic Command said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Monte Plott contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt (CNN) -- The arduous Middle East peace talks continued on Tuesday in Egypt, where officials from Israel and the Palestinian Authority \"have begun a serious discussion on core issues,\" a top U.S. diplomat said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have agreed to begin first on working to achieve a framework agreement for permanent status. That work is now well under way,\" said U.S. special envoy George Mitchell.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas attended the sessions, along with Mitchell and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Officials met for an hour and 40 minutes in bilateral and multilateral meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell briefed the media after the session and said the goals remain a two-state solution, condemnation of violence and working toward security, and a resolution of all issues. He reiterated the Obama administration's position that Israel should extend the moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank, a hiatus scheduled to end later this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We believe we are moving in the right direction overall,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parties are aiming toward resolving all core issues within the next 12 months in a process that kicked off recently during a meeting between Netanyahu, Abbas and Clinton in Washington. Issues separating both sides include Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the future of Palestinian refugees, Israeli security, and the status of Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton and Mitchell are expected to continue talks with the leaders in Jerusalem on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTensions are growing over the issue of possible new Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Netanyahu is under pressure from the Palestinians and the Obama administration to extend a 10-month moratorium on building Israeli settlements in the disputed West Bank territory. That moratorium is set to expire September 26.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinians have said the construction would torpedo the talks, but Israel says some construction is likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledging that the settlement issue is sensitive in Israel, Mitchell said both sides have a responsibility to continue the meetings and he called on Abbas to take steps to advance the talks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All issues ultimately must be resolved by the parties themselves,\" Mitchell told reporters. \"The United States will, as we've said on many occasions, be an active and sustained partner throughout the talks and will, when necessary and appropriate, make proposals and provide encouragement to the parties. In the end, matters must be resolved by parties themselves and we hope and expect that they will do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell said he wouldn't divulge many details about the talks, noting the importance of confidentiality and sensitivity. But he did say \"our vision is for a two-state solution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That includes a Jewish, democratic state of Israel living side by side in peace and security with a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous state of Palestine. But of course, this is one of many sensitive issues the parties need to resolve themselves and that's the point of negotiations. The parties will reach agreement on all major issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Tuesday morning, Clinton said if there are no negotiations, there will be no security for Israel and no state for the Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't Clinton's first time to participate in an attempt to secure a two-state solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs first lady, though not a principal negotiator, she traveled to the Middle East to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in support of President Bill Clinton's policies on the issue. The president eventually hosted Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Camp David, Maryland, for what proved to be unsuccessful final-status talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as secretary of state, Clinton has a second chance and a more direct platform to help the parties reach a comprehensive settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould Clinton help shepherd an agreement, it would \"fulfill a longtime desire to succeed in this area,\" said Ned Walker, who was U.S. ambassador to Israel during part of President Clinton's second term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She has something of a long history of being involved\" in the region, said Walker, who also used to be an assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. \"This would be a great fulfillment for her personally and for the administration and the country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ben Wedeman, Jason Hanna and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Jury selection is set to start Monday in a trial pitting two children of Martin Luther King Jr. against their brother, whom they accuse of mishandling the late civil rights leader's estate.\n\n\n\nBernice King and her brother Martin Luther King III say  Dexter King took funds from their father's estate.\n\n\n\nBernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting \"substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America\" for his own use, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nAlso named as a defendant is the Martin Luther King Jr. estate, which is incorporated. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator.\n\n\n\nThe three are the only shareholders in the corporation, and the plaintiffs hold at least 20 percent of its outstanding shares.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends Dexter King illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse the plaintiffs' legal costs. The document, which lists five counts, does not say how much he is accused of taking.\n\n\n\nDexter King has denied the accusations.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings.\n\n\n\nThe three are the only surviving children of Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968, and Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. Their oldest child, Yolanda King, died in 2007. Bernice King administers her mother's estate.\n\n\n\nIn a countersuit, Dexter King has asked a judge to force Bernice King to turn over their mother's personal papers, including love letters central to a now-defunct $1.4 million book deal.\n\n\n\nMartin Luther King III and Bernice King complained that Dexter King refused to hold shareholders meetings, which they said was another example of his lack of transparency in handling their father's estate.\n\n\n\nThere had been no shareholders' meeting of the corporation since 2004, something that Dexter King blamed on the distraction caused by the deaths of his mother and sister. Judge Ural D. Glanville ordered a meeting, which was held last week.\n\n\n\nIn a hearing held in late September, Glanville, who will preside over the trial in Fulton County Superior Court, also expressed serious concern about governance of the King estate.\n\n\n\nThe judge issued an order saying \"the court is extremely troubled.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted that Dexter King, as the majority shareholder, wields significant power in the corporation because he holds 80 percent of its shares. He alone can constitute a quorum for transacting business, the order says.\n\n\n\nThe judge warned all three Kings that any failure to comply with the Georgia Corporation Code could result in the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- I've never been one to attend the performances of symphony orchestras, but off and on, for more than 35 years, I gave myself the gift of something even better:\n\nPaul Harvey received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bush in 2005.\n\nI would go and sit with Paul Harvey as he broadcast his radio show.\n\nIt was music; it was thrilling. I met him in the early 1970s, when I was a young newspaper reporter in Chicago, and that's when he allowed me, for the first time, to sit silently in his studio as he did his work. Over the years, whenever I felt a need for a Paul Harvey fix, he was always welcoming, and we came to know each other well. I would sit there wordlessly and observe absolute excellence.\n\nHe would invariably be wearing a smock when I arrived -- he had been working since well before the sun came up, and the smock would cover his shirt and tie. It was the kind of smock a jeweler might wear, or a watchmaker -- it was crisply pressed, the uniform of an expert craftsman. I never asked him why he wore it, but I suspect that was the reason -- pride in craftsmanship.\n\nHe would be at the typewriter, honing his script. He was famed for his voice, but the writing itself was so beautiful -- his respect for words, his understanding of the potency of economy, his instinct for removing the superfluous. The world heard him speak, but the world never saw him write, and I think he honored both aspects of his skill equally.\n\nHe would walk down the hallway to his studio just minutes before airtime. The studio itself -- when I first knew him it was on the west side of North Michigan Avenue, and in later years he moved it to the east side of the street -- was far from lavish. It was impossible to equate the spartan surroundings with the idea that his voice was leaving this little room and traveling around the world. Maybe that was the point: He worked for the illusion of unfussy intimacy.\n\nHe would make these warm-up noises -- voice exercises, silly-sounding tweets and yodels, strange little un-Paul-Harvey-like sounds -- and he showed no self-consciousness about doing it in front of someone else, because would a National Football League linebacker be self-conscious about someone seeing him stretch before a game, would a National Basketball Association forward be worried about someone seeing him leap up and down before tipoff? This was Paul Harvey's arena, and he would get the voice ready, loosening it, easing it up to the starting line.\n\nAnd then the signal from the booth, and. . .\n\n\"Hello, Americans! This is Paul Harvey! Stand by. . . for news!\"\n\nAnd he would look down at those words that had come out of his typewriter minutes before -- some of them underlined to remind him to punch them hard -- and they became something grander than ink on paper, they became the song, the Paul Harvey symphony. He would allow me to sit right with him in the little room -- he never made me watch from behind the glass -- and there were moments, when his phrases, his word choices, were so perfect -- flawlessly written, flawlessly delivered -- that I just wanted to stand up and cheer.\n\nBut of course I never did any such thing -- in Paul Harvey's studio, if you felt a tickle in your throat you would begin to panic, because you knew that if you so much as coughed it would go out over the air into cities and towns all across the continent -- so there were never any cheers. The impulse was always there, though -- when he would drop one of those famous Paul Harvey pauses into the middle of a sentence, letting it linger, proving once again the power of pure silence, the tease of anticipation, you just wanted to applaud for his mastery of his life's work. iReport.com: Share your memories of radio legend Harvey\n\nHe probably wouldn't have thought of himself this way, but he was the ultimate singer-songwriter. He wrote the lyrics. And then he went onto his stage and performed them. The cadences that came out of his fingertips at the typewriter were designed to be translated by one voice -- his voice -- and he did it every working day for more than half a century: did it so well that he became a part of the very atmosphere, an element of the American air.\n\nHe had difficult years toward the end. At one point there was a problem with his vocal cords, and he had to leave his broadcast for an extended period; when he came back he told me he had felt fear and the deepest kind of despondency, because he thought he might be finished. He wasn't; he was able to work again, and then in the last 12 months he became ill, and his beloved wife, Angel, died; he turned 90 and he wasn't on the air as much.\n\nI was in St. Louis last fall to cover the vice presidential debate, and I was taking a morning walk through the suburb of Clayton. I was on Wydown Boulevard, on a sidewalk beneath some old and thick trees, and the cell phone in my pocket rang. It was Mr. Harvey.\n\nI didn't know exactly why he was calling that day, and I still am not certain, but my sense was that he just felt a need to talk. This was during the time when his radio appearances had become sporadic; I knew how lonely he was without Mrs. Harvey. The voice, of course, was much older, and not as strong, but it was his voice, arriving out of the air in yet another American town, and what I said to him then is what I will say to you now: It was wonderful to hear it again.\n\nI walked down the street, his voice in my ear.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- This week, we pulled the cotton from our ears and emerged from our dark caves of seclusion to open this here column up to user-submitted questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome submissions were inanely obvious (no, don't tweet that picture of your boss, I don't care if he told you about his chinchilla fetish at happy hour the other week), some were boring beyond belief, and, many, oddly, were just plain stalkerish. But not in the way you might think.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, we've covered the topic of how to deal with online stalkers when the attention is unwanted. But more and more, as gaining access to anyone on this rapidly rotting Earth of ours is easier than ever, we Web denizens are wondering: Does using the Internet to check someone out make me a stalker?\n\n\n\n\n\nChances are, probably not. Read on for a couple of queries on this issue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I was waiting for the bus the other day, I evaluated the attractiveness of all the people at the stop; there was one obvious winner. Then the seat next to him was the only seat open. Upon sitting down, he immediately engaged me in very adorable and flirty conversation. We exchanged names and we both talked about what we were studying at school, but I didn't have an opportunity to give him my number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anyway, with his name and major, I was able to find him after only 30 seconds of Googling. I want to contact him but I'm not sure how. Especially because it would be like, 'Hey, I stalked you a tiny bit to find your full name.' My question is: What's the appropriate (read as LEAST CREEPY) way to contact this person and what should I say in a message?\" - Creepy Crushing in Chicago\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going ahead and assume (for the sake of brevity) that you are not an insane stalkery-type person who collects the hair and toenails of her crushes, which she then uses to construct elaborate shrines to their beautiful (soon-to-be-departed) souls. If you are such a person, please cease reading, and, uh, please don't hurt me.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving on: It seems like in your case, you don't have that many degrees of separation between you and your bus boy. You attend the same school, take public transportation (i.e. you're poor) and are not, in fact, Luddites. In this case, I say: Be bold. You found him on Google, you say? If you found his Facebook profile (and not some old swim-meet records from middle school), go ahead and send him a brief message (\"Hope your meeting on the downtown campus went off without a hitch!\") and a friend request.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a method is nice and private -- tweeting \"Hey! You're freaking hot\" might be a little embarrassing -- and if he doesn't respond, you can always chalk it up to the fact that Facebook is cutting down on notification e-mails. Our lives are public nowadays, and if homeboy didn't want to be found, well, then he could always limit his visibility on the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n(If his profile is indeed hidden but you tracked down his e-mail address, follow a similar tack. Unless, that is, his e-mail address was hidden on page 38 of Google results at the end of an article he wrote freshman year about the campus parade-and-circus club. In that case, give up.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, it's not like the phenomenon of searching out star-crossed potential lovers is anything new (that's what Missed Connections et al are for), so we're guessing your dude will be flattered at the very least that you sought him out. And hey, maybe now you can meet up and compare hair-and-toenail shrines. <3\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Through some Facebook stalking, I recently discovered my ex had gotten married. (We're no longer FB friends). Although that was a shock for sure, the real heartbreaker was that all my friends (who are still FB friends with her) didn't disclose any of this information to me. ... Not even the engagement! How do I tell them they're backstabbers without admitting I'm a stalker?\" - Backstabbed in BK\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Backstabbed, it doesn't really seem like you have been, in fact, backstabbed. You're not Facebook friends with your ex anymore, you say? If you refer to our column on how to deal with breakups online, we recommend unfriending exes after particularly painful breakups, which is exactly what you have done (congrats on your reading-comprehension skills).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that you unfriended this girl indicates you don't want her in your life -- and don't want your life in hers -- so we can see why your friends didn't call you immediately after she decided to tie the knot.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, we get that this is information you would rather get from a friendly face than from a half-sloshed night of Facebook stalking, sandwiched between, \"Oh, Laurie has a new baby. ... It's hideous!\" and \"Joel went to prison again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to call up your pals and -- rationally -- explain that you would rather they not hide your ex's huge life moments from your sensitive (yet manly) gaze, go ahead and do it. Just explain that you were idly clicking through Facebook after a few too many mojitos and decided to check up on a few of your exes. Your friends will understand, because they are likely stalking their exes as we speak.\n\n\n\n\n\nStalking exes on Facebook is basically akin to a distasteful bodily function: We all do it, but no one goes around bragging about it in mixed company.",

  "context": "(Departures.com) -- St. Andrews and the surrounding Kingdom of Fife, on Scotland's east coast, present golfing visitors with such a bountiful harvest of links that there's no single \"correct\" itinerary that best covers the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany first-timers head straight for the slate of courses played in the European Tour's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship -- the Old Course, modern classic Kingsbarns (greens fee, $295) and, crossing the nearby Tay Bridge into Angus, Carnoustie Golf Links (greens fee, $215). Perhaps the St. Andrews New Course (greens fee, $110), a tough-as-nails layout with the fastest greens in town, might be thrown in for good measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are all top choices, and of course the Old, with its supremely intricate design providing a different playing experience every time out, is an essential. But to make the most of one's time in St. Andrews, one should never simply be a big game hunter. Mixing in some of Fife's less-heralded courses adds quirk, variety, fun -- and likely a few more birdies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIN ST. ANDREWS\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's often overlooked that the St. Andrews Links Trust manages seven courses in and around the town, including the Balgove (greens fee, $20) and Strathtyrum (greens fee, $40) courses, both of which are beginner-friendly, with fewer hazards but the same wonderfully crisp links turf as their big brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose looking for a stronger challenge on a full-sized course in town might try their hand at The Duke's (greens fee, $185), part of plumbing tycoon Herb Kohler's St. Andrews mini-empire.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenovated in 2006 by golf architect Tim Liddy, who also added five new holes, The Duke's is a stylish heathland design that would likely garner more attention were it situated in any other neighborhood. Holes like the seventh, a long dogleg right that begins with a dramatic drive from a hillside tee, and the 13th, a tricky par four with disarming views of St. Andrews, are well worth seeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut make no mistake, this is not a links. While the turf is reasonably firm, The Duke's can't help but play more like an American course. For that reason, it's probably better to schedule a visit early in the itinerary, before all those little swing adjustments it takes to play links golf set in.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartures.com: Top hotel penthouses\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD HICKORY\n\n\n\n\n\nFife's two newest courses opened the same week in the summer of 2008, and they couldn't be more different. One of them, the Links Trust's Castle Course (greens fee, $190), debuted with the hype of a Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster -- and similarly mixed reviews. The other, which would not look at all out of place in an episode of Downton Abbey, opened (or, more accurately, reopened) quietly after a 69-year fallow period to become one of the most delightful golf experiences in Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nTucked away in the verdant hills west of St. Andrews, Kingarrock Hickory Golf Course (greens fee, $40 for nine holes and $55 for 18) is a nine-hole, 2,022-yard country estate course that is played exclusively with antiquated equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nProprietor David Anderson, always nattily attired in tweeds and plus fours, provides visitors with hickory-shaft clubs and replica golf balls from either 1898 or 1924. These clubs -- for example, a mashie with a perfectly smooth face, a niblick resembling a designer spatula or a driver bearing the signature of a 19th-century Open champion -- are eccentric, to put it mildly, in both looks and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHickory shafts bend far more readily than steel, and once out on the course, golfers quickly find that in order to make clean contact, their swing must take on a languid, half-speed rhythm. This adjustment builds an element of comedy into the proceedings -- even the most skilled players are bound to hit a few laughable shots -- but the beauty of it is that it's impossible to take this version of the game too seriously. It's still Real Golf, just on a smaller scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, a par four of a mere 200 yards becomes plenty challenging when a good drive flies only about 150. The click of the soft ball against the persimmon clubhead reverberates through the player's hands and arms, a reminder of what modern technology, in its eternal quest for greater distance, has taken away from the game. Afterward, Anderson often joins visitors in the pro-shop cottage, where the yarns of the day are spun over ginger beer and homemade shortbread cookies.\n\n\n\n\n\nKingarrock, in essence, is the kind of place that can change the way one thinks about golf.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartures.com: Perfect vacation villas to rent\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLIFF-HANGER\n\n\n\n\n\nCatapulting back to the 21st century, a modern layout that's worth seeing is the Kittocks Course at the Fairmont St. Andrews (greens fee, $75-$140). The Fairmont property has always operated at a bit of a disadvantage because it's two miles outside of town (the resort runs shuttles back and forth), but it has a legitimate place on the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany golfers gravitate toward the resort's Torrance Course, as it is considered the \"championship\" track (this August it hosted the Scottish Senior Open), but the Kittocks, designed by Bruce Devlin with an assist from a legendary Masters champion, the late Gene Sarazen, is almost as challenging and plays over a more appealing piece of land.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany holes either swoop down toward or run right along the North Sea -- the drivable par-four tenth by the cliff's edge is particularly exciting. Golfers frequently catch stirring glimpses of the St. Andrews skyline and the Grampian Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Kittocks Course is eminently walkable, golf carts are also permitted -- a point worth mentioning in a country where the motorized \"buggy\" is usually taboo. Given that visitors to St. Andrews frequently walk 36 holes or more a day for several days at a stretch, the chance to get off one's feet and still play a quality course should not be underestimated.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartures.com: Luxury safari camps\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL CHARACTER\n\n\n\n\n\nTime now for a classic. On the southern coast of Fife, about 20 minutes from St. Andrews, lies the former Royal Burgh of Elie and its eponymous links. The game has been played here in some form since 1548, and since 1875 the links have been overseen by The Golf House Club (greens fee, from $120).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor pure charm, Elie has few peers -- this, along with its prime location between Edinburgh and St. Andrews, makes it a popular \"holiday club\" for members of both the Royal & Ancient Golf Club and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (Muirfield).\n\n\n\n\n\nElie's quirky character is evident from the very first hole, where tee shots are fired blindly over a hill. To ensure that the group ahead is safely out of range of the one that follows, a club member came up with a novel solution: The starter's hut is rigged with the periscope from a scrapped submarine, the HMS Excalibur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a sophisticated piece of equipment,\" says the starter, Ken Murray. \"The farther the distance [of the target], the better the resolution. On a clear day, I can swing it round and see them putting at Muirfield\" -- on the far side of the Firth of Forth, some eight miles away.\n\n\n\n\n\nElie is a short course -- only 6,273 yards from the back tees -- but it's full of surprises. With its ball-eating rough, well-positioned bunkers and ingeniously contoured greens, it doesn't respect brute force without an equal degree of accuracy. It's a throwback to an age when golf courses were laid out in accordance with the natural terrain rather than forced into a standardized mold.\n\n\n\n\n\nElie reaches its par of 70 through the unorthodox combination of 16 par-four holes and two par threes. The absence of par fives may come as a disappointment to flat-bellied bombers accustomed to chewing up such long holes, but they should still find an eagle chance or two: for example, the wonderful 288-yard tenth, a blind hole where a well-placed drive crests the rugged ridge and catches the downslope, then scrambles up to the green. But beware: With a helping wind, the long hitter runs the risk of driving the ball over the green and into perdition on the rocky beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nPUTTING AROUND\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best local diversions is the Himalayas Putting Course (fee, $3; The Links, St. Andrews), which probably delivers as much enjoyment per dollar as any course in Scotland. This tiny patch of land right next to the Old Course is one of the few bits of turf not controlled by the Links Trust -- it's owned by the St. Andrews Ladies Putting Club, which has operated the course since 1867.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the name might suggest, this continuous swath of green features some of the wildest, wooziest contouring anywhere, with humps, bumps and hollows galore to vex and delight golfers of all ages. The Himalayas has the same kind of lighthearted spirit as an inspired miniature golf course, but it's played on real links turf, so even the most serious players should find reason to smile. It's the perfect way to end a day at the Home of Golf.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartures.com: A global guide to yachting\n\n\n\n\n\nClassic Golf Clubs\n\n\n\n\n\nShould the temptation to return home with a set of hickories prove strong, consider paying a visit to Hamish Steedman and Ewan Glen at the St. Andrews Golf Company, a 130-year-old concern that's one of the world's last remaining manufacturers of playable hickory clubs. Sets start at $1,300; 20 St. Andrews Rd., Largoward, St. Andrews.\n\n\n\n\n\nBooking St. Andrews Old Course\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades now, tee times at St. Andrews Old Course have been allotted through a byzantine ballot system. The drawing is conducted a day in advance, so visiting players -- unless they've made arrangements through a premium tour operator like Perry Golf or The Old Course Experience -- have to throw their names into the hat and cross their fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it doesn't work out, they end up scrambling to find somewhere else to play on short notice. Fortunately, this policy is about to change. Starting in 2012, the ballot will be extended to two-day advance booking, which should make a world of difference. Greens fee starts at $225; reservations@standrews.org.uk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2010 American Express Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",

The Duke has made a significant contribution to his business role over the last 10 years and has always acted with complete integrity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying Prince Andrew knew nothing about about the alleged offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Duke of York categorically denies any knowledge of any meeting or conversation between the Duchess of York and the News of the World journalist,\" Buckingham Palace said, using alternate titles for Prince Andrew and Sarah\n\n\n\n\n\nFerguson.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has carried out his role as a British trade envoy since 2001 \"with complete and absolute propriety and integrity,\" the palace said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- It took about 110 years and some delicate surgery on his most private parts, but Henry -- a lizard-like creature from New Zealand -- is now a dad.\n\nHenry, the oldest tuatara to mate at Southland Museum, enjoys a cold shower in his home in New Zealand.\n\nHenry, a tuatara who, as far as curators at Southland Museum in New Zealand know, had never mated before, hooked up with Mildred, a younger woman of about 80, in March.\n\nIn July she laid 11 healthy eggs and, this week, all 11 of them hatched -- the last one on Wednesday.\n\n\"Eleven out of eleven,\" curator Lindsay Hazley said Friday morning. \"Bloody brilliant. We had a champagne breakfast to celebrate.\"\n\nHenry was the oldest tuatara ever to mate at the museum, on New Zealand's South Island, Hazley said.\n\nTuataras are the only living descendants of an order, related to dinosaurs, that flourished 200 million years ago. They're endangered, only living on a handful of islands in New Zealand, which makes Henry's happy news all the more important to supporters of the species.\n\nBut it didn't come easy.\n\nUntil about six years ago, Henry was a nasty, irritable fellow who showed no interest in mating and would attack females when they were introduced. Hazley, who has been breeding tuataras for the past 35 years, eventually had to put him in \"solitary confinement.\"\n\nBut in 2002, veterinarians discovered that a lump in Henry's nether regions was a cancerous tumor. They removed it and, over the next few years, his mood -- and interest in the ladies -- improved.\n\nNow, Henry lives peacefully with Mildred and two other females. Breeders are hoping he'll show interest in Lucy, who is about the same age as Mildred, later this year. Female tuataras only lay eggs every two or three years, so Mildred likely won't be interested.  Watch a curator take care of the reproducing dinosaur kin \u00bb\n\nHenry's newfound libido does have some limits, however. Hazley said Juliet, a youthful 22 year old, appears to be too hot to handle for the centenarian -- who could live to be 200 years old if he stays healthy.\n\n\"I think he's a bit shy to mate with such a young woman,\" Hazley said. \"After a bit of experience with Mildred and Lucy, maybe he'll be interested in Juliet next year.\"\n\nMaxing out at about two-and-a-half feet long, tuataras are much smaller than their ancestors.\n\nThe word \"tuatara\" is derived from a Maori word meaning \"spiny back.\" In Maori legend, they are messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and they were featured on one side of a New Zealand five-cent coin that was phased out in 2006.\n\nIt's been a baby boom at Southland Museum lately. Hazley said another 10 babies were born to another couple recently -- swelling the ranks of the 50 or so tuataras that were already there.\n\nFriday morning, Hazley was working to install a camera so Henry's international fan base can watch him and other tuataras on the Internet. But they shouldn't expect any images of the proud dad playing with his batch of hatchlings.\n\n\"If it's small and it moves, it's food,\" Hazley said. \"He'd have them for lunch.\"",

  "context": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Three weeks after an apparent misunderstanding sparked a confrontation, deadly Hindu-Christian riots continue unabated in the remote east Indian state of Orissa.\n\n\n\nPolice officers chase away a protester in Mangalore, India, Monday.\n\n\n\nBy Tuesday, about 20 deaths had been reported, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police in the worst-affected Kandhamal district.\n\n\n\nThe latest casualty is a police officer who died after an armed mob of about 400 to 500 mostly Hindus torched a police station in the district on Monday, Orissa state police said.\n\n\n\nOrissa's Director General of Police G.C. Nanda the policeman died when the mob opened fire at officers fleeing the burning building.\n\n\n\nThe attack, he said, may have been in retaliation for arrests that police made in the ongoing communal fighting.  Watch more about the riots in India \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe attack came two days after police fired on a crowd to prevent it from attacking Christian residents. Between three and six people died in the shooting, CNN's sister network CNN-IBN reported.\n\n\n\nThe violence spread to southern India over the weekend when vandals attacked 14 churches in an hour in the state of Karnataka Sunday, the network said.\n\n\n\nThe Christian community in the Karnataka -- numbering about 2.5 million -- said right-wing Hindus are targeting them for opposing the violence in Orissa.\n\n\n\nBy Tuesday, police had arrested about 140 people in connection with the riots, said Karnataka's Inspector General of Police A.M. Prasad.\n\n\n\nSixty of them -- all Hindus -- were arrested for the church attacks, Prasad said. The rest, mostly Christians, were charged with disturbing the peace, he said.\n\n\n\nOrissa has historically been a tinderbox of Hindu-Christian tensions.\n\n\n\nSome Hindu groups view the work of Christian missionaries in the state with suspicion. They accuse missionaries of bribing or forcing Hindus into converting.\n\n\n\nThe seeds for the current conflict were planted on August 23, when Hindu leader, Laxmananda Saraswati, and four others were killed in Kandhamal after 20 to 30 gunmen barged into a Hindu school and began shooting, the Orissa chief minister's office said.\n\n\n\nThe authorities have not determined who killed Saraswati, but after the incident they detained five people who are Christians, said Sukanta Panda, spokesman for the chief minister.\n\n\n\nThe government says the killings may have been the work of Maoist rebels -- investigators have many unanswered questions -- but some hardline Hindus blamed a Christian minority.\n\n\n\nThey took to the streets in anger, rampaging through predominantly Christian neighborhoods, ransacking shops and torching houses.\n\n\n\nThey chopped down trees to block roads, making it difficult for police to reach trouble spots. A Christian orphanage was set on fire. A 20-year-old woman, who was teaching children inside, burned to death.\n\n\n\nChristian residents fought back, and the clashes spread. Authorities imposed a night curfew in many towns and deployed state and federal forces in the troubled areas, Kumar -- the police superintendent -- said.\n\n\n\nBoth sides said the violence has left Christian churches and Hindu temples razed to the ground.\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time the simmering anger has boiled over in the state with deadly consequences. In 1999, a Hindu mob burned to death an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, and his two children while they slept inside their car.\n\n\n\nAnd last Christmas, clashing groups killed four people and burned several churches in the same Orissa district -- Kandhamal.\n\n\n\nMaoist rebels, who claim to be fighting for the poor and the dispossessed, have been battling the Indian government in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s.\n\n\n\nSome Christians accept the Maoist theory, saying the rebels have also struck against hard-line Hindus because they associate them as being closely aligned with the government.\n\n\n\nBut Hindu groups insists that Christians were behind Saraswati's death.\n\n\n\nUnlike Orissa, Karnataka has until now been spared the large-scale clash between Christians and Hindus.\n\n\n\nBut now, many in the Christian community fear their calm and prosperous state may become another battleground between the two religions, CNN-IBN said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Harmeet Singh contributed to this report",

Click the links to read views on President Obama's inauguration from people across the country.\n\n\n\nReaction to speech What Obama means to Americans Hopes for Obama\n\n\n\nReaction to speech\n\n\n\nPublic inauguration-viewing parties were held in auditoriums, schools and arenas across the country, where the atmosphere mirrored the excitement in Washington.  Watch people react at viewing parties \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"People are cheering here as if they were there,\" Irene Koehler of Fremont, California, said of the atmosphere in Oakland's Oracle Arena.\n\n\n\nMore than 200 parishioners from the First AME Church, the largest African-American Church in Los Angeles, gathered in the recreation hall to pray together and share in the excitement of an historic moment\n\n\n\nDressed in Obama shirts and hats, the level of audience participation had the effect of transporting the crowd to Washington.\n\n\n\nThey stood when Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked the crowd to \"please stand\" and bowed their heads in prayer. They sang along with Aretha Franklin and even took pictures of the screen when Obama appeared.\n\n\n\nA handful of viewers had tears in their eyes, but most were filled with \"pure joy.\"\n\n\n\n\"On Election Night, I was full of tears. I am all cried out -- it is all about joy now,\" said 72-year-old Shirley Turner-Haymer, the granddaughter of a former slave.\n\n\n\nEven young parishioners derived some significance from the event.\n\n\n\n\"It's really inspirational that we have a black president now ... because now I could see I can do whatever I want,\" said David Colvin, 10.\n\n\n\nLynn Gabriel Thomas, far right, says she is watching the inauguration in honor of her father.\n\n\n\nLynn Gabriel Thomas, daughter of Tuskegee Airman Daniel Moore, was one of about 300 people who crammed into the Jackie Robinson Center in Pasadena, California, to watch the inauguration.\n\n\n\n\"My father would be so thrilled to see this, Barack Obama being sworn in.\" Thomas said. \"He loved parades, and he hated crowds. I'm here for him.\"\n\n\n\nAcross the country in New York's Bronx borough, students huddled in the halls of a school to watch the ceremony on a projection screen.\n\n\n\n\"They were cheering; they were clapping; they were in awe because everything we had talked about they were able to see,\" teacher Marta Rendon said.\n\n\n\n\"When they heard Obama's speech, they were right there clapping and screaming with the rest of us. It was really something. It was really amazing.  Watch Obama promise hope over fear \u00bb\n\n\n\nMore than 100 people gathered at the central library in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, to watch the ceremony.\n\n\n\n\"It was really exciting to see people being excited about the country and really happy about there being a new president. And it was great to see such a collective sense of community ... hope and happiness,\" said Jessica Namakkal, a 29-year-old graduate student from Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n\"I think Obama's speech was great and that he really addressed the past eight years in a diplomatic and fair way, while also sort of pushing forward in a good way.\"\n\n\n\nThe unusually bitter cold affected the turnout at Daytona Beach, Florida's, outdoor inauguration celebration, forcing people to take shelter at a local bar.\n\n\n\nSean Mingo and his mother, Joan, watched the inauguration in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\n\n\nMore than 50 people packed into Mai Tai to watch the inauguration on television. Among them were Joan Mingo and her 13-year-old son, Sean, who stayed home from school to watch Obama take the oath of office.\n\n\n\n\"This is very historical,\" said Sean, who followed Obama's campaign and watched every debate. \"Obama is inspiring. I want to work in politics.\"\n\n\n\nSean said his favorite line of Obama's speech was \"we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\"\n\n\n\nAs Obama was sworn in, the coffee-drinking bar patrons laughed, applauded and wiped tears from their eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Obama gives us hope, son, that you can be whatever you want,\" Joan Mingo said to her son.\n\n\n\nWhat Obama means to Americans\n\n\n\nObama's rise holds special meaning for Solas B. Lalgee, who was in New York's Times Square for the inauguration.  View images from the inauguration \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"I'm ecstatic,\" said Lalgee, 30, whose father is from the West Indies. \"It's the first time in my life I've ever had someone to look up to. I'm a mixed, multi-ethnic, multinational person, and I've never had someone I could look up to politically and say, 'That's somebody who can represent me. That's somebody who I can relate to. That's somebody that my family can relate to,' and the fact that he actually made it into office is just ... it gives me hope that I can do whatever I want to do in my life and not have a glass ceiling above me.\"\n\n\n\n\"To me, as an immigrant, it really means a lot to see a son of immigrants -- not only an African American but a son of immigrants -- come to the highest office in the land,\" she added. \"There's hope. And I hope to transmit that to my children.\"\n\n\n\nChinoise Noble and her mother, Yolanda Lee-Singleton, watched the inauguration in Los Angeles' Nokia Plaza.\n\n\n\nIn California at downtown Los Angeles' Nokia Plaza, 23-year-old Chinoise Noble clutched a photograph of her grandmother as tears streamed down her face.\n\n\n\nShe said she brought the photo so her late grandmother could be with her on a day though that her grandmother never believed would come.\n\n\n\nShe \"would never in a million years have thought there'd be a black president!\" Noble said.\n\n\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, the site of racial turmoil during the Civil Rights era, Fred Jemison had high hopes for the Obama administration.\n\n\n\n\"The biggest thing that I look forward to, that I anticipate from this, is unity throughout the country, racially and politically,\" Jemison told CNN affiliate WBMA at Birmingham's Boutwell Auditorium.\n\n\n\nAt the Jewish Home, a senior living facility in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, about 70 residents and staff members watched the inauguration.\n\n\n\n\"This is wonderful and exciting,\" said 92-year-old Sylvia Segal, wearing a Barack Obama T-shirt. \"There's never been an inauguration like this one, with so many millions giving respect to the United States and an extraordinary man.\"\n\n\n\nShelly Balzac, 81, said that he voted for Obama and that when he was a teenager, his father took him to Chicago's Soldier Field to witness Franklin Delano Roosevelt campaigning.\n\n\n\n\"It's momentous when you look at the conglomeration of all citizens of all colors and all creeds,\" said Balzac, a World War II veteran who said he witnessed the \"dehumanizing of blacks\" during those years and fought against it within the U.S. military.\n\n\n\n\"It is an emotional day for me,\" Balzac said. \"I realize the tremendous stride in making this a more unified country.\"\n\n\n\nStan Keller and his daughter, Nancy, watch the inauguration at the Jewish Home in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\"I was crying inside all day,\" said Stan Keller, 88. He said Obama has inspired him to try to make a difference in the world.\n\n\n\n\"I came on Earth to make it a better place to live. I get that inspiration from this man,\" he said.\n\n\n\niReporter Lee Ann Schmidt of Danbury, Connecticut, watched at home with her husband and two dogs.\n\n\n\n\"Just to be alive in this time to witness this, it means more to me than anything,\" she said. \"I'm 35. My generation has never really seen the entire country come together in a positive way like this. It really does give me hope for our country.\"\n\n\n\nIn Raleigh, North Carolina, iReporter Sam Shaber watched the events with his parents at their house.\n\n\n\n\"We are all snowed in and have a bottle of champagne ready,\" he said. \"I am gay, and to have just any minority be elected is such a milestone in so many ways.\"\n\n\n\nHopes for Obama\n\n\n\nJeff Teasley, a 49 year-old Navy veteran from Cheyenne, Wyoming, has been disabled since he hurt his back in 1990.\n\n\n\nJeff Teasley, in his home in Cheyenne, Wyoming, hopes Obama is \"the best thing since running water.\"\n\n\n\nTeasley, a Republican who did not vote for Obama, was less enthusiastic over Obama's inauguration. Like many here in Wyoming, he fears that President Obama will expand the government and pass the cost onto people like him.\n\n\n\n\"With bigger government comes bigger taxes and with bigger taxes comes more strain on everybody's households.\"\n\n\n\nBut Teasley said he is still rooting for the new president.\n\n\n\n\"I hope he pulls it off. I hope he's the best thing since running water because we need a leader, we need someone to direct these people in Washington.\"\n\n\n\nOthers were more optimistic.\n\n\n\nIn downtown Atlanta, Georgia, hundreds of people huddled together in freezing weather in Centennial Olympic Park to watch on two screens.  Watch kids from Atlanta sing for Obama \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"There's hope for a change,\" said Sonita Horn, a homemaker whose husband lost his job as an electrician in Atlanta and now travels three weeks out of four to Virginia for work.\n\n\n\nShe said she hoped not only that Republicans and Democrats would find a way to work together but that the races would, too.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone will be treated equally,\" she predicted. \"We're now a United States of America, not a black America or a white America.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Chris Welch, Michael Cary, Paul Vercammen, Lindy Hall and Jim Spellman contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Libyans erupted in jubilation Thursday from the very first incomplete reports that ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi was dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nA \"cacophony of celebration\" could be heard in Tripoli as ships and cars blasted their horns and shots were fired into the air, said CNN's Dan Rivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very, very loud -- a lot of excitement,\" Rivers said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a great moment,\" said Mahmoud Shammam, information minister for Libya's National Transitional Council. \"I've been waiting for this moment for decades, and I'm thanking God that I'm alive to see this moment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo footage showed a Tripoli street where people embraced and jumped in joy and crowds ran alongside vehicles. Other rejoicing people were hanging out of car windows and sunroofs and gathered in the beds of pickup trucks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sound of cheering could be heard, along with a call to prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside a hotel, staff including chefs wearing their white hats gathered, dancing and waving Libyan flags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're breathing a huge sigh of relief here,\" Rivers said. Many Libyans were concerned that a free Gadhafi might play a role in destabilizing Libya in the future, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sirte -- Gadhafi's hometown and the city where he was discovered -- video showed people gathering in celebration, some riding on the tops of cars waving Libyan flags and shooting guns in the air as horns honked.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne man, dressed in fatigues and carrying a weapon, ran up and kissed a television camera. Others chanted, danced and waved their hands in the air, some flashing the \"peace\" sign.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany had suspected Gadhafi was hiding in Sirte after revolutionary forces took Tripoli in August. He had not been seen in public in months.\n\n\n\n\n\nA former regime loyalist who did not want to be identified said in an e-mail to CNN that Gadhafi's death was \"good for the Libyan people\" because both his supporters and opponents \"can see a valid point in his death that they can relate to, although for different reasons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis supporters, he said, can find \"remedy for their belief that he was on the right side of history defending his country\" from NATO occupation. Gadhafi's death \"will end morally and practically the NATO involvement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, he said, \"his supporters see him as a martyr, and this gives them (a) sense (of) pride, which provides a psychological remedy\" for many of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis opponents can find justification for their belief that they fought \"a liberation battle for a better future, better democratic society, better Libya generally.\" Gadhafi's death will bring them \"the heights of their sense of satisfaction for what they did,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Gadhafi had been captured alive, this former regime loyalist wrote, it would have \"intensified (supporter's) effort to destabilize society further, for the hope that either they might be able to liberate him, or get one of his sons to power.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, he said, \"would bring more destruction and devastation to society in general at all levels; including the death of many people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the ousted leader had been put on trial, the former loyalist added, it \"would have open(ed) many doors of disagreement that might lead to fight(ing), if not mass civil war.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media sites such as Twitter showed users expressing support for the Libyans and noting that Gadhafi's death would be another victory in a year that has seen the ouster of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and former Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, as well as the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose from countries that participated in the so-called Arab Spring issued messages of support for Libyans.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.",

  "context": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Gustav churned into the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday night, still an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 storm threatening to blast the same region devastated by Hurricane Katrina three years ago.\n\n\n\nSaturday morning, Gustav was about 255 miles east-southeast of the western tip of Cuba.\n\n\n\nGustav, a Category 4 storm with 135 mph (220 km/hr) top winds, was centered 485 miles (780 kilometers) southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, according to the National Hurricane Center's  6 a.m. GMT (2 a.m. ET) advisory.\n\n\n\nThat's only 15 mph slower than when the storm first crossed land in Cuba. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm could pick up even more strength as it enters the gulf's warmer waters.\n\n\n\nThe Hurricane Center said Gustav is an \"extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane.\"\n\n\n\nIn the United States, state and federal officials -- eager to prove they are ready -- urged residents to flee, and many of those residents obeyed, moving north by the tens of thousands, according to the governor of Louisiana, whose state was hit three years ago by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called Gustav \"the mother of all storms,\" saying its destruction could outstrip that from Katrina, which flooded much of his city and killed about 3,000 people.\n\n\n\nA hurricane watch remained in effect for the northern Gulf Coast from east of High Island Texas eastward to the Alabama-Florida border, including the city of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, the National Hurricane Center said. A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 36 hours.\n\n\n\nOn its current track, Gustav would reach the northern Gulf on Monday.\n\n\n\nThousands of anxious Cubans had boarded up their homes and sought safety from Gustav earlier as it slammed into the island nation. as it made landfall in western Cuba on Saturday night with sustained winds near 150 mph (240 kmh), the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\n\nSome fluctuations, with an overall slight strengthening, is forecast for the next 24 hours, and forecasters said Gustav could become a Category 5 hurricane within that period.  See Gustav's projected path \u00bb\n\n\n\nHurricanes are ranked 1 to 5 in intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A Category 5 is the highest classification, with sustained winds of more than 155 mph. A Category 4 has winds of 131 to 155 mph and can cause extreme damage.\n\n\n\nAnticipating the storm, about 10,000 Cubans evacuated Saturday to Cuba's mainland from La Isla de Juventud, or Isle of Youth, a province south of the nation's western end. The hurricane center said western Cuba could receive as much as 25 inches of rain.\n\n\n\nResidents sought refuge with family or friends, or went to a government shelter, CNN's Morgan Neill said.\n\n\n\nCubans also headed to higher ground on the mainland, with many utilizing horse-drawn carriages and vintage cars.\n\n\n\nPresident Ra\u00fal Castro checked with the island's officials Saturday to be sure preparations were on track, Neill said.\n\n\n\nCuba's western province of Pinar del Rio, currently under a hurricane warning, is the center of the nation's lucrative cigar industry.\n\n\n\nA hurricane warning remained in effect for the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, la Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Isla de Juventud, Matanzas and Cienfuegos. A warning indicates that hurricane conditions will arrive in the next 24 hours.\n\n\n\nGustav caused little damage on Grand Cayman on Friday night, according to an official at the Island's airport.\n\n\n\nAs a tropical storm, Gustav blasted Jamaica with high winds and drenched it with heavy rain Thursday night into Friday. Four people were killed, the National Emergency Operations Center in Jamaica said, and the storm downed trees and damaged houses.\n\n\n\n\"It is total devastation everywhere,\" the councilor for the Manchioneal division, Alston Hunter, told the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper. \"Several residents are now crammed into disaster shelters here in east Portland, and the weather continues to make the situation worse.\"\n\n\n\nAt least 51 people were killed in southwestern Haiti and eight were killed in neighboring Dominican Republic as Gustav roared through as a Category 1 hurricane on Wednesday, officials there said.\n\n\n\nThe hurricane center's five-day forecast places a landfall anywhere from Galveston, Texas, east to Mobile, Alabama.\n\n\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, is at the center of the projected path.\n\n\n\nA hurricane watch remained in effect for the northern Gulf Coast from east of High Island, Texas, to the Alabama-Florida border, including the city of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, the National Hurricane Center said. A watch means hurricane conditions are possible within the specified area, generally within 36 hours.\n\n\n\nThe Gulf Coast is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people when it slammed ashore August 29, 2005.\n\n\n\nMississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said Hurricane Katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state's coast will begin evacuating this weekend.\n\n\n\nGustav is the second major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Hanna passed north of the Leeward Islands on Friday with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph), the hurricane center said.\n\n\n\nThe center predicted gradual strengthening, and Hanna could be near hurricane strength Sunday.",

At least 10 people were arrested in clashes with officers, a New York police spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlsen suffered a skull fracture Tuesday night after allegedly being struck by a tear gas canister in Oakland, California, according to witnesses.

In Atlanta, police arrested dozens of demonstrators at a downtown park after they failed to leave the facility as ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, authorities said Thursday that Occupy Nashville participants will be required to have permits, according to a statement from the state's Department of General Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Susan Candiotti and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

As the name implies, it causes tumors on the face and neck, and sometimes other parts of the body, and it's passed by biting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian government has committed $7.8 million over five years to the Save the Tasmanian Devil program, according to Garrett.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is to help with research into disease transmission and treatment, and will support captive and wild populations,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, the program established a captive breeding insurance population. Disease-free animals were gathered from the wild population and are being bred on the mainland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As of February 2009, the insurance population had grown to 145 disease-free Tasmanian devils\" at 10 zoos and wildlife parks, the Tasmanian government said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The animals in this breeding program could play an important role, if ever needed, in helping re-establish healthy wild populations in Tasmania.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the image of the Tasmanian devil has been popularized around the world by the Looney Tunes cartoon character Taz, the real thing is a much different animal. The devil, the world's only surviving marsupial carnivore, is about 25 pounds (12 kg) of bad attitude, with a haunting cry that's a combination of snorting and growling.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The recent ruling of a federal appeals court requiring the family of fallen hero Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder to pay the legal expenses of Fred Phelps and his misguided followers at Westboro Baptist Church is unconscionable.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Matthew's father, Albert, I am all too familiar with the hardships associated with losing a son in combat, having lost my son Justin in 2004. It is a tragedy that the thanks given the Snyder family in return for the life of their son is a court order to repay the legal expenses of the hate group that protested at his funeral with signs such as \"thank God for dead soldiers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond simply insulting though, this decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals is a slap in the face for every Gold Star family that has lost a loved one in combat. It also represents an egregious misuse of the judicial system; one that sets a dangerous precedent for how the memory of our fallen heroes will be treated. The Supreme Court should immediately move forward with this case and stand up for those who have stood in the face of danger for all Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legal maneuvers that brought Albert Snyder and his family to this point are enough to make any American shake his or her head in disgust. After Snyder lost his life in 2006, Fred Phelps and his followers showed up at his funeral to spread their message of hate.\n\n\n\n\n\nMind you, they didn't know Matthew, and thus had no understanding of the enormous sense of loss his family was feeling; they simply decided that the Snyder family's vulnerability presented an easy platform for their own agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo his credit, Albert Snyder sued the group and won an $11 million judgment against them. However, that award was reduced to $5 million on one appeal and overturned altogether this week by the appeals court.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, not only did the court overturn the original ruling, but it decided to add to the pain and suffering of the Snyder family by imposing more than $16,000 of court fees. Perhaps the judges had forgotten that without the sacrifices of brave soldiers and their families, the American judicial system would have been a long-distant memory.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the inherent injustice of the court's decision is the message it sends to the thousands of families around the country that have received a tightly wrapped flag and heard the words, \"On behalf of a grateful nation ...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Snyder family sued to protect the common decency we should provide to all grieving families, their efforts were met with court orders to pay the legal bills of those who caused their family so much needless pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely, this is not the kind of thing that Lance Cpl. Snyder or my son, Justin, gave their lives to protect. Has our nation learned nothing from our treatment of returning Vietnam veterans? What would have been the reaction to Fred Phelps and his repugnant actions during World War II? Our veterans and the families of those who didn't return deserve better than this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, as engagements in Afghanistan draw on and our soldiers answer the call to defend freedom around the world, this case could have a dangerous effect on morale and willingness to serve.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is time for the Supreme Court to take up this case, not only for families like Albert Snyder but for the families who will bear the ultimate price of freedom in the future. The justices should strike down the ruling of the Virginia court that brushed aside the sacrifice of Lance Cpl. Snyder and restore common sense and basic decency to the way we honor our fallen heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSnyder fought on behalf of all of us, and now his father fights on his behalf. I can only hope that the Supreme Court will restore some measure of justice and dignity to a family so richly deserving of the best the United State has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Ellsworth.",

And now I'm back so it's amazing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe teen acknowledged the 27,500-mile voyage wasn't easy. He told CNN that pirates off the coast of Indonesia gave him quite a scare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[I] had a boat circle in and ended up calling in the coast watch and they chased them off but, yeah, [I] lucked out there! About an hour and a half of hell.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSevere storms also were a problem, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunderland's Web site says he bought the boat with his own money.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis parents had hoped he would find something that would spark a fire in him, a passion that would direct him away from all the negative and harmful influences that are so prevalent in society, but even they were stunned by the scope of his dreams and desires, it says.  Watch Sunderland give advice to fellow teens \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was 16 when he left Marina del Rey on June 14, 2008, aboard his boat, Intrepid. Solitude and exhaustion were just a couple of factors that faced him each day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The hardest constantly was the tiredness,\" he said. \"I mean, you get over the loneliness, but tiredness, it's an ongoing thing. Half the time I haven't slept in 48 hours and it's just hard to get enough rest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSunderland said he made some good contacts along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's interesting just thinking back to the different places in the world because I have so many friends in different parts of the world that are like family, you know, and all these different experiences,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an amazing year. It seems like yesterday that I was here but in other ways it seems like a hundred years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what's next? \"Yeah, I don't know, just go chill with my friends,\" he said. \"Go skate. Go do something normal for a change, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.",

  "context": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan officials said 26 people across the country were killed in election day violence, although they hailed Thursday's vote as a success.\n\n\n\nA woman dips her finger in ink to show she voted in Bamiyan, one of Afghanistan's more peaceful provinces.\n\n\n\nNearly 95 percent of the more than 6,000 polling stations across Afghanistan opened on Thursday, according to government and electoral officials.\n\n\n\nCounting is under way but initial results are not expected for another 36 to 48 hours, while final results will not be certified until mid-September.\n\n\n\nOfficials extended voting until everyone waiting in line had a chance to cast their ballots.\n\n\n\n\"At some [polling stations] there is a very large line,\" said Azizullah Ludin of Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission. \"We have to complete all these people that are coming here.\"\n\n\n\nIt is the nation's second presidential election since the 2001 fall of the Taliban.\n\n\n\nLudin said the decision to add more time to vote was because of a large turnout at some stations and technical issues that delayed voting for others.\n\n\n\nThere were no official details on voter turnout and it has been difficult to get an accurate count of how many Afghans voted in defiance of threats of violence from the Taliban.\n\n\n\nCNN's Atia Abawi said election officials at one polling station in Kabul had already begun counting ballots after a low turnout when the order to extend voting reached them. Afghan voter turnout low as presidential election nears end \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen asked how many ballots had been counted, an election official said 1,000 -- which seemed high to the CNN crew that had been at the polling station all day. \"We were there all day and we did not see 1,000 people,\" CNN's Kevin Flower said.\n\n\n\nElection workers in central Bamiyan province immediately began reopening the polls after the order to extend voting.\n\n\n\n\"Election workers had put up security tape barriers and even tied down the flaps to their voting tents shortly after 4 p.m. local time,\" CNN's Ivan Watson reported from the province. \"The security tape has been removed and voters are straggling in again.\"\n\n\n\nElection observers from 30 groups -- both domestic and international -- said voting in Kabul province was fairly smooth, though a few reports surfaced of irregularities at various polling stations.\n\n\n\nAfghans were electing a president from 40 hopefuls and 420 members of the provincial council in what was seen in the international community as a high-stakes test for the fledgling South Asian democracy.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban had vowed to disrupt the voting and the risk factor in some areas may have been too high for some Afghans to venture out to vote.  Watch an election monitor in Kabul discuss what's being examined \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe government ordered a ban on media coverage of incidents of violence in an effort to \"ensure the wide participation of the Afghan people\" as 300,000 NATO and Afghan soldiers were out in force to safeguard voters.\n\n\n\nThe independent Pajhwok Afghan News, which had announced it would not heed the media ban, posted online reports of deadly attacks across Afghanistan. CNN has not confirmed those incidents.\n\n\n\nAfghan security officials said voting day violence claimed the lives of 17 Afghan policemen and soldiers, and another nine civilians.\n\n\n\nAn American service member was killed in a mortar strike in eastern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. It did not say where the attack took place.\n\n\n\nMajor fighting continued for a second day in the city of Baghlan, north of Kabul, security sources said. Rockets were fired at the town throughout the day, a day after heavy fighting that claimed the life of the city's police chief, the sources said. Afghans in Baghlan are afraid to leave their homes to cast their ballots, Afghan security officials said.\n\n\n\nIn the eastern city of Gardez, four rockets pounded the outskirts of the city, while a roadside bomb struck in another area, the local security chief said. There were no casualties from either incident.\n\n\n\nBut other parts of Afghanistan have been largely spared the daily drumbeat of car bombs, assassinations and whizzing rockets.\n\n\n\nEnthusiasm filled the air as voters lined up to have their say. Pajhwok reported brisk turnout in western Herat province, which borders Iran. Khwaja Mahboob told Pajhwok that he voted for a woman for a provincial council seat because he believed women should have a stronger say in Afghanistan.  Watch what ranks high among Afghan concerns \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn central Bamiyan province, where predominantly ethnic Hazaras suffered under Taliban rule, thousands of voters cast their ballots behind cardboard screens inside dust-caked tents.\n\n\n\nPolice struggled to hold back and search the crowd and at one point, people pushed through, breaking off one of the gates to the polling center.\n\n\n\nAfter voting, one elderly man admitted he wasn't sure who he voted for. \"Whoever God wants will be king,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMany Afghans are illiterate and rely on symbols like light bulbs and books to identify their candidates on the ballot paper.\n\n\n\nOrganizers from Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission said 11 polling centers in Daikundi province were closed because of security concerns.\n\n\n\nSome polling stations in eastern Kunar and Nuristan provinces did not open and others, including 100 in Ghor, opened without a security presence, according to Pajhwok.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan observers and experts said a high turnout would help marginalize the Taliban which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.\n\n\n\nIncumbent President Hamid Karzai, dressed in his traditional purple and green striped robe, cast his vote shortly after the polls opened and had his finger stained with ink that is supposed to last for two weeks, a measure intended to thwart fraud by preventing people from voting multiple times.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure this will be for peace, for progress and for the well-being of the Afghan people,\" Karzai said.\n\n\n\nBut at some Kabul polling stations, the ink apparently was not potent enough, according to Damaso Magbual, an observer from the Asian Network for Free Elections.\n\n\n\nAt another station, a boy who successfully voted with a fraudulent registration card, admitted to being only 13, Magbual said.\n\n\n\nKarzai's top rival was his former finance minister Abdullah Abdullah, who once served as a confidante of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the charismatic leader of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance killed by al Qaeda.  Who are the candidates? How does the voting work? Read here \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe other candidate who gathered steam in the campaign was former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, a Western-educated man who served as a World Bank analyst.\n\n\n\nKarzai was named interim leader after the fall of the Taliban regime and won the 2004 election by a significant margin. His popularity, however, has waned in recent months as Afghanistan has been crippled by corruption and increasing bloodshed.\n\n\n\nBoth Abdullah and Ghani hailed anti-corruption measures and government transparency as centerpieces of their campaign platforms.\n\n\n\nWomen's votes were seen as crucial after an especially repressive period for women under the Taliban when they were stripped of rights. But in some polling stations Thursday, women voters were greatly outnumbered by men.  What do Afghans want? See in photos here \u00bb\n\n\n\nHabiba Surobi, the female governor of Bamiyan, said women who live in remote Afghan villages are still not aware of their rights. \"This is something to be concerned about,\" she said, adding that it was the responsibility of Afghanistan's women leaders to ensure better awareness and education.\n\n\n\nAbout 15 million of Afghanistan's 33 million people are registered to vote. Earlier, officials had estimated that number as 17 million.\n\n\n\nCNN's Atia Abawi and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Lisbon, Portugal (CNN)  -- Let's face it, footballers have a bad rep. They are labelled by many as overpaid selfish prima donnas who could not care less about the world around them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may in reality apply to some players, but definitely not all of them. In Lisbon I recently met many who truly enjoy being role models and were honored to take part in the 7th edition of the United Nations (UN) Match Against Poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, in light of the tragic earthquake in Haiti, all of the proceeds went to the devastated country as 55 thousand people filled the Stadium of Light to greet some of the best footballers on the planet, both past and present.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likes of Kaka, Thierry Henry, Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane lent a hand to this cause. Organizers were hoping to raise over $750 000 and in ticket sales alone, that target was reached.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving the privilege to be behind the scenes at this match in my home country, I spoke with various players about their involvement in it. One of the most concerned about the plight of the Haitian people was Thierry Henry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Barcelona forward, who made headlines for the wrong reasons after his controversial handball which helped prevent Ireland from attending the World Cup, had already personally pledged $90,000 to the French aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am very touched by this tragedy and it is very good that everybody should mobilize in order to help Haiti,\" Henry told his club side Barcelona's official Web site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This touches me because almost 20 years ago something similar happened in (the French Caribbean island of) Guadeloupe and I know what the Haitians must be going through. I have many friends over there. Haiti is a former French colony and it's as if we are cousins.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry showed true concern for a nation that needs all the help it can get to rebuild its infrastructure and its hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nZidane, Kaka and Figo were others who told me they were shocked by some of the footage they saw coming out of Haiti. As the death toll rose, they felt they needed to do something to help, and were delighted so many high-profile names showed up.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all, some 40 international players participated in a match that was qualified as a success by all, including the former Arsenal striker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must help them. I felt I should do something and that's why I have decided to make a donation to Medecins sans Frontieres,\" said the former Arsenal legend.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Forty years ago this week, three men in a tiny spacecraft slipped their earthly bonds and traveled where no one else had before, circling the moon 10 times and bringing back an iconic image of a blue-and-white Earth in the distance, solitary but bound as one against the black vastness beyond.\n\n\n\nHost Nick Clooney (left) and astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders answer questions in October.\n\n\n\nThe voyage of Apollo 8 from December 21-27, 1968, marked humans' first venture to another heavenly body.\n\n\n\n\"We were flying to the moon for the first time,\" said Jim Lovell, one of the three astronauts aboard the historic flight. \"Seeing the far side of the moon for the first time. Coming around and seeing the Earth as it really is -- a small fragile planet with a rather normal star, our sun.\"\n\n\n\nBut beyond the monumental aspects of such a scientific achievement, the feat was a major psychological and emotional boost for many Americans at the end of a particularly bad year in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nThe Tet offensive in January 1968 had left many Americans shocked and doubting that victory in Vietnam was possible. In April, the Rev. Martin Luther King was assassinated, and streets throughout the nation erupted in fire and fury. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down two months later.\n\n\n\nThat summer, the nation watched in horror as police and anti-war protesters battled in the streets of Chicago during the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\n\nThe launch of Apollo 7 in October was a major victory for NASA, putting the space program back on track after a 22-month interruption because of a launch pad fire that had killed three astronauts in January 1967.\n\n\n\nThen came Apollo 8.  Gallery: Images of the Apollo 8 mission \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Providence happened to put everything together at the end of the year to give the American public an uplift after what had been a poor year,\" Lovell told CNN on Monday.\n\n\n\nReaching the moon was \"a big psychological step,\" said Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham.\n\n\n\n\"The public said, 'Hey, human beings are going to another body in the solar system,' \" Cunningham told CNN in a telephone interview from his home in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n\nThe mission produced one of the most famous photos from the space program, showing a large chunk of gray moon in the foreground and a dappled blue-and-white, three-quarter Earth rising in the distance.\n\n\n\nApollo 8 also produced what to many was one of the most inspirational and soothing moments in history when Lovell and crewmates Frank Borman and William A. Anders took turns reading from the Book of Genesis. It was Christmas Eve and the whole world was watching. NASA said at the time it was expected to be the largest TV audience to date.\n\n\n\nThe astronauts signed off with these words: \"And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a merry Christmas and God bless all of you, all of you on the good earth.\"\n\n\n\nThe timing could not have been better, Lovell said.\n\n\n\n\"It happened that it all jelled,\" he said by telephone. \"The fact that we circled the moon on Christmas Eve. A screenwriter couldn't have done a better job.\"\n\n\n\nThe success of the mission also gave the United States a major boost in its race against the Soviet Union to see who would get to the moon first. The United States would land two men on the moon in the summer of 1969 on Apollo 11, beating the Soviets and fulfilling a goal set by former President John F. Kennedy at the beginning of the decade.\n\n\n\n\"There was a great psychological significance of sending a spacecraft to the moon,\" Cunningham said. \"It was not a psychological leap for any of us [astronauts] to go to the moon.\"\n\n\n\nThe astronauts, he said, were used to taking risks and knew they could do it. But NASA officials had some tough choices to make.\n\n\n\n\"For the people on the ground, it was a big step for them,\" Cunningham said. \"Making life-and-death decisions about somebody else's life is a lot more difficult than making one about your own.\"\n\n\n\nFor astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the sixth person to walk on the moon, the Apollo 8 mission signified a major milestone in human history, much like when the Phoenicians started exploring the Mediterranean Sea nearly 3,000 years earlier.\n\n\n\n\"We became citizens of the galaxy, as opposed to citizens of the planet,\" Mitchell said Monday.\n\n\n\n\"For my parents' generation, it was aviation,\" said Mitchell, who is 78. \"My generation went off the planet altogether. We became the first generation of spacefarers.\"\n\n\n\nFor the astronauts, most of them former test pilots, going to the moon was just another job.\n\n\n\nWere they fully aware of the significance of what they were accomplishing, Lovell is asked.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" he says immediately. \"We were focused on trying to do the right thing. Focused on trying to accomplish something.\"\n\n\n\nLovell went on to fly another historic mission, Apollo 13 in April 1970. That flight, which he commanded, became famous when an oxygen system aboard the craft blew up and the three astronauts had to limp around the moon and back to Earth using makeshift and improvised systems. Their triumph over adversity was immortalized in the movie \"Apollo 13,\" in which Tom Hanks played Lovell.\n\n\n\nLovell was supposed to land on the moon that time, but did not make it.\n\n\n\n\"Twice a bridesmaid, never a bride,\" he said with a laugh, admitting that for years he harbored resentment that the mission had been a \"failure.\"\n\n\n\nIt was only in later years, Lovell said, that he fully realized what a success that mission had been, as he and his two crewmates returned safely to Earth.\n\n\n\n\"It is mind-boggling in some respects,\" he said Monday.",

  "context": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on.\n\n\n\nRelatives carry the coffin of Osman on Saturday after his funeral ceremony in Istanbul.\n\n\n\nErtugrul Osman, grandson of Sultan Abdulhamid II and heir to the Ottoman throne, died this week in Istanbul of kidney failure at the age of 97, after having lived most of his life in exile in a humble third-floor walk-up apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.\n\n\n\nOsman's funeral in the garden of the mammoth Sultanahmet Mosque was attended by Turkish state ministers, artists and media glitterati. They lined up to pay their respects to Osman's widow, Zeynep Osman, herself a descendant of the royal family of Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nOne woman pressed her forehead to Mrs. Osman's hand in a traditional Turkish show of respect, saying \"I'm just an ordinary person, but I would like to kiss your hand.\"\n\n\n\n\"His death marks the passing of an era,\" wrote Jason Goodwin, author of \"Lords of the Horizons,\" which tells the history of the Ottoman Empire, in an e-mail to CNN. \"Osman himself was born into a family that still ruled an empire stretching from the Balkans to the Indian Ocean. He was named after the founder of his dynasty, who lived seven centuries ago.\"\n\n\n\nDuring annual campaigns at the peak of its power, the Ottoman Sultan's army of Janissaries struck fear into the hearts of European monarchs. For 400 years, the Ottomans declared themselves the \"caliphs\" -- spiritual leaders -- of the Muslim world.\n\n\n\nBut the empire declined during the 19th century, eventually suffering a humiliating defeat and partition at the hands of Allied armies during World War I.\n\n\n\nIn 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship. Two years later, Ataturk banned the caliphate, declaring Turkey a secular state.\n\n\n\nErtugrul Osman, who had played as a boy in the imperial palaces of Istanbul, was sent with the rest of his family into exile. He lived for decades in Europe, then moved after World War II to the United States. Friends say he ran a successful mining business in Chile. They described Osman as a polyglot Renaissance man with a passion for politics and opera and a taste for evening cocktails.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Osman told reporters he had no interest in assuming the Ottoman throne.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, after more than half a century outside the country, Osman returned to Turkey at the invitation of a Turkish prime minister.\n\n\n\nFriends say that, prior to getting a Turkish passport in 2004, he traveled using documents identifying him as an Ottoman citizen.\n\n\n\nThe hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family.\n\n\n\nOne man rushed Bulent Osman, a tall, elderly French-born nephew of the deceased, kissing his hand and crying in Turkish? \"My prince, we are guilty for how we treated you!\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not a prince,\" Osman later explained to a reporter in French-accented English. \"I am quite surprised. It is the first time I have seen such an outpouring.\"\n\n\n\nThe royal family seems to be especially revered by devout muslim Turks, who see the sultan's descendants as a link to the abolished Islamic caliphate.\n\n\n\n\"They are our grandfathers,\" said a young man named Fatih, who wore the long beard, turban and robes of a fundamentalist Islamic sect. \"They glorified our religion and brought it to the highest level.\"\n\n\n\nThe funeral was attended by an eclectic mix of mourners -- stylishly dressed members of the royal family who grew up in Europe alongside fervent Islamists, some of whom pushed through the crowd ordering women to move to the back to pray.\n\n\n\nHundreds of police officers blocked traffic as Osman was buried in a garden filled with the gravestones of Ottoman pashas and viziers, beside the ornate tombs of his grandfather Sultan Abdulhamid II and another ancestor, Sultan Mahmut II.\n\n\n\nOsman's death serves as a reminder of Turkey's recent, yet often forgotten Ottoman history, said historian Jason Goodwin.\n\n\n\n\"His funeral may be a catalyst for modern, republican Turkey to overcome its historical amnesia, and come to terms with its own past,\" Goodwin said.",

Iran's presidential election will take place on June 12.\n\n\n\nThe attack happened in Sistan-Balochistan province in southeastern Iran, the same province where a Shia mosque was bombed Thursday. Several suspects have been arrested in connection with Thursday's attack in the town of Zahedan, which killed between 15 and 20 people, according to Iranian media reports.\n\n\n\nNo group publicly accepted responsibility for the mosque attack, but the provincial governor, Ali-Mohammad Azad, blamed a terrorist group that he said would be unveiled to the public once the suspects have been interrogated, IRNA reported.\n\n\n\nZahedan is about 1,100 km (700 miles) southeast of Tehran, near Iran's borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nSistan-Balochistan province -- which shares a border with Pakistan -- is the site of frequent clashes involving Iranian police, drug dealers and armed groups. The province is located on a major narcotics-smuggling route between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n\n\nAzad said information on the arrested terrorist group would be unveiled to the public once interrogations were complete.\n\n\n\n\"The terrorists and notorious gang planned to stir order and security in the province on the eve of (the June 12 presidential) elections, using ongoing insecurity in our eastern neighbors,\" he said Thursday.\n\n\n\nSeveral days of mourning were reported to be under way for victims of the explosion.\n\n\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami, a hard-line cleric who led Friday prayers in Tehran, said there were signs that the United States and Israel were involved in the mosque bombing, IRNA reported. The cleric, who put the death toll at 25, condemned the bombing before a congregation on the Tehran University campus.\n\n\n\nCNN's Shirzad Bozorghmehr contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques -- including forced nudity and waterboarding -- on suspected terrorists, despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys, according to a Senate report released Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate report focuses on the authorization to use aggressive techniques to interrogate detainees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques, redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality, and authorized their use against detainees,\" said the report, which reveals new details about prisoner treatment at U.S. military prisons in Cuba, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives, strengthened the hand of our enemies and compromised our moral authority,\" the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full report on the Senate Armed Services Committee investigation was declassified Tuesday by the Defense Department, less than a week after the Obama administration released several Bush-era memos detailing the use of such techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my judgment, the report represents a condemnation of both the Bush administration's interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse ... to low-ranking soldiers,\" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate committee, said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Claims, such as that made by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that detainee abuses could be chalked up to the unauthorized acts of a 'few bad apples,' were simply false.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate report said that in December 2001 the Defense Department's General Counsel's Office solicited information on the \"exploitation\" of detainees from the federal agency charged with training U.S. troops on how to withstand enemy interrogation techniques considered illegal by the Geneva Conventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry to that agency, the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was submitted more than a month before then-President George Bush signed a memo stating that U.S. military personnel \"shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of the Geneva Conventions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate committee's investigation was largely focused on the influence of a Joint Personnel program called \"Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape.\" The program is used to train U.S. soldiers how to resist enemy interrogation, and employs harsh techniques such as forced nudity, use of fear, sleep deprivation and -- until last year -- waterboarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate report said Bush administration officials green lighted the use of Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape techniques on detainees -- despite warnings from military psychologists against doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report includes an e-mail from an Army psychologist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[T]he use of physical pressures brings with it a large number of potential negative side effects ... If individuals are put under enough discomfort, i.e. pain, they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain,\" said Lt. Col. Morgan Banks, the senior Army Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape psychologist, in an October 2, 2002, e-mail to personnel at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin said the program is supposed to prepare troops in the event they are captured and subjected to abusive interrogations, and that it was \"never intended to be used in the interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a section titled, \"The Department of Justice Changes the Rules,\" the Senate report noted that less than a week after the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency sent the Defense Department information about the interrogation techniques, the Justice Department issued two legal opinions signed by then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first opinion \"presented a narrow interpretation of what constituted torture under U.S. law,\" the report said. The memo said that to constitute torture, physical pain would have to match the intensity of that accompanying \"serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions or even death.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinion said the administration could defend itself against the federal anti-torture statute by arguing necessity or self-defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second opinion concerned the interrogation of a specific detainee, al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydeh, and concluded that 10 different techniques -- including sleep deprivation and waterboarding -- did not violate prohibitions against torture.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the Obama administration released the second Bybee opinion -- which the Senate committee did not have access to during the investigation -- and three others written by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury in May 2005. Bradbury's opinions concern hypothetical situations with the same interrogation techniques, as well as some others not mentioned in the 2002 memo. Those memos also conclude, for varying reasons, that the techniques did not violate prohibitions against torture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate report reveals new information about Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape use on accused enemy combatants held at Guantanamo -- which President Obama plans to close within a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By early October [2002] there was increasing pressure to get 'tougher' with detainee interrogations\" at Guantanamo, according to testimony cited in the Senate report from a military behavioral scientist, Maj. Paul Burney, who worked with interrogators at the facility in Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Burney and a colleague drafted a memo proposing aggressive interrogation techniques at the facility. The scientist testified that Guantanamo's intelligence chief told him the memo needed to contain coercive techniques or it \"wasn't going to get very far,\" the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin said that despite \"serious legal concerns raised by the military service lawyers,\" Defense Department General Counsel Jim Haynes recommended that then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approve 15 of the interrogation techniques -- including stress positions, removal of clothing, use of phobias (such as fear of dogs) and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Rumsfeld's December 2, 2002, approval, senior Guantanamo staff issued a memo on the use of aggressive techniques, saying, \"The premise behind this is that the interrogation tactics used at U.S. military SERE schools are appropriate for use in real-world interrogations,\" according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report details how Rumsfeld's approval prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques. Military officials essentially copied and pasted interrogation policies from Guantanamo, and posted them as their own in Afghanistan and, ultimately, Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2003, U.S. Central Command lawyers raised concerns about the interrogation techniques authorized for Abu Ghraib, which included stress positions, sleep deprivation and exploiting fears of dogs, the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report reveals a newly declassified September 16, 2003, e-mail from a CentCom lawyer, Maj. Carrie Ricci, who warned that \"Many of the techniques appear to violate [Geneva Conventions] III and IV and should not be used. ...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDozens of military personnel who served at Abu Ghraib confirmed that the interrogation techniques cleared by Rumsfeld had made their way to the prison, according to the Senate report.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Army dog handler at Abu Ghraib told military investigators in February 2004 that \"someone from [military intelligence] gave me a list of cells, for me to go see, and pretty much have my dog bark at them. ... Having the dogs bark at detainees was psychologically breaking them down for interrogation purposes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate report said that an interrogator told military investigators in May 2004 that it was \"common to see detainees in cells without clothes or naked\" and said it was \"one of our approaches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin noted that, despite the revelation of widespread use of aggressive and abusive interrogation techniques, there is still the question of whether the senior officials who approved the policies should be held accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama on Tuesday left open the possibility of criminal prosecution, saying it would be up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether to prosecute the former officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions, I would say that is going to be more a decision for the attorney general within the parameter of various laws and I don't want to prejudge that,\" Obama told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a host of very complicated issues involved there. As a general deal, I think we should be looking forward and not backwards. I do worry about this getting so politicized that we cannot function effectively and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations.\"",

  "context": "MUNICH, Germany (CNN) -- Juliane Koepcke is not someone you'd expect to attract attention. Plainly dressed and wearing prescription glasses, Koepcke sits behind her desk at the Zoological Center in Munich, Germany, where she's a librarian.\n\n\n\nJuliane Koepcke fell more than 3kms after the plane in which she was traveling broke up in midair.\n\n\n\nYet this unassuming middle aged woman has one of the most exciting and unbelievable stories of tragedy and survival to tell.\n\n\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, 1971, when Koepcke, then aged 17, and her mother boarded a Lockheed Electra turboprop for a flight from Lima, Peru, to Pucallpa in the Amazonian rainforest. Her parents, both famous zoologists, ran a research station in the jungle studying wildlife.\n\n\n\nThe airline, LANSA, had already lost two aircraft in previous crashes. \"We knew the airline had a bad reputation,\" Koepcke told CNN, \"but we desperately wanted to be with my father for Christmas, so we figured it would be alright.\"\n\n\n\nThe flight was supposed to last for less than an hour and for the first 25 minutes everything was fine, Koepcke recalled.\n\n\n\n\"Then we flew into heavy clouds and the plane started shaking. My mother was very nervous. Then to the right we saw a bright flash and the plane went into a nose dive. My mother said, 'This is it!'\"\n\n\n\nAn accident investigation later found that one of the fuel tanks of the Lockheed Electra had been hit by a bolt of lightning which had torn the right wing off.\n\n\n\n\"We were headed straight down. Christmas presents were flying around the cabin and I could hear people screaming.\"  Watch Koepcke tell her dramatic survivor's story \u00bb\n\n\n\nAs the plane broke into pieces in midair, Koepcke was thrust out into the open air:\n\n\n\n\"Suddenly there was this amazing silence. The plane was gone. I must have been unconscious and then came to in midair. I was flying, spinning through the air and I could see the forest spinning beneath me.\"\n\n\n\nThen Koepcke lost consciousness again. She fell more than three kilometers (two miles) into the jungle canopy but miraculously survived with only minor injuries. Ninety-one other people aboard Flight 508 died.\n\n\n\nKoepcke says she is not a spiritual person and has tried to find logical explanations for why she survived.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe it was the fact that I was still attached to a whole row of seats,\" she says. \"It was rotating much like the helicopter and that might have slowed the fall. Also, the place I landed had very thick foliage and that might have lessened the impact.\"\n\n\n\nIn any case she survived with only minor injuries. Her collarbone was broken, her right eye swollen shut, she was suffering concussion and had large gashes on her arms and legs.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't wake up until nine o'clock the next morning. I know this because my watch was still working. So I must have been unconscious the whole afternoon and the night. When I came to I was alone, just me ... and my row of seats.\"\n\n\n\nHer ordeal was far from over. Rescue planes and search crews were unable to locate the crash site and Koepcke was stranded in the jungle alone. But she had spent years on the research station with her parents and her father had taught her how to survive in the rainforest -- she knew how to cope in that environment.\n\n\n\n\"\"He said if you find a creek, follow it because that will lead to a stream and a stream will lead to a bigger river and that's where you'll find help.\"\n\n\n\nThe day after the crash she found a creek and started to wade down stream, but it was tough going. The only food she had was some candy she had found at the crash site and her wounds were quickly infested with parasites.\n\n\n\n\"I had a cut on my arm and after a few days I could feel there was something in it. I took a look and a fly had laid her eggs in the hole. It was full of maggots. I was afraid I would lose my arm. Later, after I was rescued it was treated and more than 50 maggots were found inside. I still wonder how so many maggots could have fitted into that little hole, it was no bigger than a one euro coin.\"\n\n\n\nAs she travelled downstream, Koepcke discovered more wreckage from the plane -- and found some of the crash victims.\n\n\n\n\"I found another row of seats with three dead women still strapped in. They had landed head-first and the impact must have been so hard that they were buried almost two feet into the ground.\n\n\n\n\"I was horrified -- I didn't want to touch them but I wanted to make sure that my mother wasn't one of them. So I took a stick and knocked a shoe off one of the bodies. The toe nails had nail polish on them and I knew it could not have been my mother because she never used nail polish.\"\n\n\n\nJuliane continued through the rainforest, wading through jungle streams infested with crocodiles, piranhas and devil rays.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes I would see a crocodile on the bank and it would start into the water towards me, but I was not afraid. I knew crocodiles don't tend to attack humans.\"\n\n\n\nAfter 10 days, starved and exhausted, Koepke finally came upon a small boat and a hut on the river. She stayed there, hoping to be rescued. The next day a group of Peruvian lumberjacks found her and brought her to the next town.\n\n\n\nShe became known as the miracle girl and was hounded by Peruvian media, receiving hundreds of letters from people she had never met before.\n\n\n\n\"It was so strange,\" she says, smiling. \"Some of the letters were simply addressed 'Juliane -- Peru' but they still all found their way to me.\"\n\n\n\nThe events of 1971 still haunt Koepcke and she says the memories are especially clear when she is confronted with airline disasters like last month's Air France crash off the coast of Brazil.\n\n\n\n\"It just horrifies me. I only hope it all went quickly for those on board.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Katy Brown is an Internet-savvy college freshman with conservative perspectives who worries about the future of the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nKaty Brown, Kevin Neugebauer, Barbara Rademacher and Chuck Burkhard discuss the future of the GOP.\n\n\n\nBrown, a student at Kent State University in Ohio, joined other Republicans and conservative independent iReporters in an online roundtable discussion.\n\n\n\nThe Republican National Committee selected Michael Steele to become its chairman Friday during its annual winter meeting after the decisive victory of President Obama in November.\n\n\n\nOver the next four years, Republicans must regroup and establish a strategy, and the new GOP leader must navigate a political landscape where the Democrats control the White House and both houses of Congress.\n\n\n\n\"I think we'll come with somebody who has experience, knows what they're talking about, is good with both liberals and conservatives, both Democrats and Republicans,\" Brown said of a future Republican presidential nominee. iReport.com: Watch Brown respond to one of Obama's Cabinet picks\n\n\n\nKevin Neugebauer of Katy, Texas, a Republican who voted for Sen. John McCain in the election, said during the chat that he thinks the majority of Americans are conservative and that he wants to see the party head in a more conservative direction. iReport.com: 'McCain wasn't conservative enough to win'\n\n\n\nNeugebauer thinks that abiding by conservative principles, especially fiscally, is the only way to solve the country's financial problems.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to have to mortgage my kids' future to get us out of the things we're doing today,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAnother panel participant, Chuck Burkhard of Windber, Pennsylvania, voted for McCain as a registered Republican but plans to become an independent.  Watch the iReporters talk over a Web chat \u00bb\n\n\n\nHe feels that the Bush administration failed at making government smaller and reducing spending, which he thinks Republicans should make a top priority. He hopes that the party will take a new direction and reach out to more people.\n\n\n\n\"I really think the Republicans will reach out with a grass-roots campaign,\" he said. iReport.com: 'I choose Sen. McCain'\n\n\n\nNeugebauer said he thinks the Republican Party needs a \"fresh new face\" who can set the agenda. He says the government needs to be smaller and thinks politicians waste money on \"stuff that the government has no business being in.\"\n\n\n\nThe fourth panel participant, Barbara Rademacher, said she had a difficult time making her decision during the 2008 election. She finally settled on McCain but says she is very much an independent voter. Social issues such as abortion are what swung her to the right, but she said the party focused too much on attacks.\n\n\n\n\"I hate the Republican Party the way it is right now. I hated the way they acted during the election and some of the ideas they came up with as election strategies,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRademacher said she thinks former Gov. Mike Huckabee, a candidate in the 2008 race, would be a good president because of his experience. She says he has integrity, intelligence and charisma, as well as the ability to manage money. iReport.com: How will Huckabee reform the party?\n\n\n\n\"I think he may be the only hope for the Republican Party,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBurkhard, Brown and Neugebauer all agreed that Huckabee would be a good presidential candidate. Neugebauer said he also likes former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and advocated for a return to strong Republican politics.\n\n\n\n\"I just think what we need to do is, we need to concentrate on the core values that the Republican Party was started on,\" he said. \"There's too many fence-huggers. They'll say one thing just to get votes, and they actually are thinking the other way. You really need someone in there that can rally the troops and somebody with good morals and a good record.\"\n\n\n\nPaul A. Beck, a political science professor at Ohio State University, said that although Obama is president, there is a large number of conservative people in the country, and they will want their say.\n\n\n\n\"We have to remember that the 2000 and 2004 elections were very narrow elections,\" Beck said. \"The country was very divided in those elections.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he feels that many voters looked at Bush's administration and blamed him for the downfall of the economy and the war in Iraq, creating trouble for the Republican candidates who would attempt to follow him.\n\n\n\n\"It looks like the Bush administration fumbled the ball. McCain didn't know quite what to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHao Li, a student at the University of Southern California, said he wasn't Bush's biggest fan but thought the former president did \"the right thing.\" Li said he lives the divide in this country every day as a committed Republican and McCain voter in a state that went for Obama.\n\n\n\nHe describes himself as strongly fiscally conservative and socially moderate. He feels that the GOP needs to make greater efforts to reach out to minorities and young people if party members hope for success. Watch Hao Li ask about reaching out to young people in a 'Digg Dialogg'\n\n\n\n\"The party has its way of saying, 'Just work hard, and you'll get there,' and they don't really outreach to the minority community. The party shouldn't change its basic principles, but the party should outreach to women and minorities.\"",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday approved the nation's first offshore wind farm, signing off on a project that has bitterly divided Cape Cod over the last nine years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 130 turbines are to be located several miles from the Massachusetts shore in the iconic waters of Nantucket Sound. The interior secretary said Cape Wind, as the project is known, is the start of a \"new energy frontier.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The United States is leading a clean energy revolution that is reshaping our future,\" Salazar told reporters in Boston. \"Cape Wind is an opening of a new chapter in that future, and we are all part of that history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cape Wind will be the nation's first offshore wind farm, supplying clean power to homes and businesses in Massachusetts, plus creating good jobs here in America,\" he said. \"This will be the first of many projects up and down the Atlantic coast.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thank you for this decision,\" said Gov. Deval Patrick. \"With this project, Massachusetts will lead the nation. This day has been a long time coming.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the wind farm has stirred heated emotions over the years. Cape Wind became one of the most heavily vetted energy projects in the world. Seventeen state and federal agencies weighed in, reviewing everything from its impact on shipping, aviation and fisheries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalazar visited the Cape earlier this year. At the time, he pledged to cut through the nine years of regulatory red tape and make a final decision by the end of April.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, the interior secretary said the process took far too long and future offshore projects would follow a \"more rational and orderly\" process.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no reason, he said, \"why an offshore wind permit should take a decade to review and approve.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most notable opponent of Cape Wind was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a champion of green energy who, to the dismay of environmentalists, fought against the wind farm. The Kennedy compound will have a view of the wind turbines.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how the views on the Cape will change\n\n\n\n\n\nOther opponents ranged from billionaire energy giant William Koch to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. American Indians in the region also objected, saying the wind farm would be located on sacred ancestral grounds and disturb important sunrise ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am strongly opposed to the administration's misguided decision to move forward with Cape Wind,\" Sen. Scott Brown said Wednesday. \"While I support the concept of wind power as an alternative source of energy, Nantucket Sound is a national treasure that should be protected from industrialization.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn announcing his decision, Salazar said Cape Wind must follow stringent measures during construction, and it must conduct additional marine and archeological assessments of its impact. The company must also explore ways to make the wind turbines less visible from shore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The smart responsible development of wind potential on Horseshoe Shoal need not conflict with the history and tradition of Nantucket Sound,\" Salazar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenpeace, the Sierra Club and nearly every major environmental group in the nation supported the project, saying it's necessary in moving the nation forward. Six governors in the region also backed Cape Wind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even though we enjoy overwhelming majority support, it's not a popularity contest,\" Cape Wind CEO Jim Gordon told CNN. \"This decision needs to be made on the merits. And the record shows that it is in the public interest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an editorial today, the Boston Globe said simply: \"Make clean energy a reality; approve Cape Wind now.\" The New York Times earlier this week also endorsed the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Offshore wind farms are a common sight in Europe but not here,\" the Times wrote. \"Cape Wind would be this country's first -- sending, finally, a signal to the world about America's resolve to fight global warming and reduce its dependence on foreign oil.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wind farm would bring hundreds of jobs and provide up to 75 percent of the power needed by the Cape and islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, according to Cape Wind.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of the project have ranged from $800 million to $1 billion; Cape Wind has not released how much it believes the wind farm will cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the location of the wind farm\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 130 turbines, spaced a third- to a half-mile apart, will cover about 25 of the 500 square miles of Nantucket Sound. They will stand more than 40 stories tall, well over 10 times bigger than nearly every other structure around the Cape.\n\n\n\n\n\nCape Wind has said the project will not necessarily bring cheaper energy, but will bring cleaner electricity and become a model for offshore wind energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, the project's chief nemesis, has vowed to file suit to continue to try to block it. The project already has withstood multiple court challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuddy Vanderhoop, a member of the Wampanoag Tribe, harshly criticized the decision to go ahead with the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a federal embarrassment and a slap in the face not only to the tribes ... but it's also a slap in the face to the people who make their living\" off fishing in the area of the wind farm's location, Vanderhoop said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Hill has long supported Cape Wind as the executive director of the grassroots organization Clean Power Now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to be partying later on tonight,\" she said. \"We applaud Secretary Salazar for his vision and leadership in making this landmark decision and look forward to the day when the wind farm in Nantucket Sound will be producing the majority of the electrical needs of the Cape and islands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWind farms produce roughly 2 percent of the nation's energy, all from land-based facilities in California, Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming and a few other states. Locations offshore are considered optimal because the winds are stronger and more consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2008 Energy Department report calls for \"20 Percent Wind Energy by 2030.\" It said 18 percent of the nation's wind energy should come from offshore sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nCape Wind first sought a permit in fall 2001. During that time, China built its first offshore wind farm. Nine other countries have offshore farms: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Patrick said Cape Wind will now allow the United States to join the offshore wind race. \"America now has a chance to turn that around.\"",

They claim the election was a charade, with the other presidential candidates -- from left-wing parties to Islamists -- standing no real chance.\n\n\n\nThe 72-year-old was elected with over 90 percent of the vote, Reuters.com quoted the official in charge of organizing Thursday's presidential election as saying.\n\n\n\n\"Bouteflika has won ... 90.24 percent of the votes cast,\" Interior Minister Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni told a news conference.\n\n\n\nAlgerian lawmakers, most of them loyal to the president, cleared the way for him to stand for re-election last year by abolishing constitutional term limits. Critics said that would allow him to serve as president-for-life.\n\n\n\nSupporters of Bouteflika say he deserves credit for steering the North African country, an oil and gas producer, back to stability after a bloody civil conflict in the 1990s that killed an estimated 150,000 people.\n\n\n\nBut critics say he is using the threat of renewed violence from Islamic militants to mask the country's deepening economic problems.\n\n\n\n\"I continue to regard the restoration of civil peace as a national priority, as long as hotbeds of tension and pockets of subversion survive,\" Bouteflika, running for a third term, said in his final campaign speech on Monday, Reuters.com reported.\n\n\n\nHe has also promised to spend $150 billion on development projects and create 3 million jobs, his remedy for an economy in which energy accounts for about 96 percent of exports but where other sectors have been choked by red tape and under-investment.",

  "context": "Harrison, New York (CNN) -- Investigators from Toyota and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday inspected a wrecked Prius and extracted data from the car's event data recorder they hope will help determine what caused the car to speed out of control.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe driver of the car told police the 2005 Prius accelerated on its own as she was driving down her employer's driveway on March 9. She lost control of the car, crossed the road and crashed into a stone wall, police say. She was treated for minor injuries. No other cars were involved in the accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of six inspectors from Toyota and two from NHTSA spent several hours taking photos and measurements of the damaged vehicle and downloading the black box data from the car, which has been at the Harrison Police Department since the accident. Two independent inspectors from a forensic technology company, hired by the Police Department, also were aiding the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Toyota spokesman, Wade Hoyt, said that in this model year Prius, the black box contains data only from the moment the airbags deploy, but not the three seconds before impact that newer models are programmed to record. Hoyt said investigators were pleased they were able to extract any data from the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are getting information on engine speed, pedal position, that sort of thing,\" Hoyt said. \"I'm happy we have it. It's possible it might not have been in there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice say the car's driver, whose name has not been released pending the investigation, has a clean driving record and there is no reason to believe she is to blame for the accident. But Acting Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said driver error is not being ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure we're going to have conclusive information as to what caused this accident. But we're not ruling out any possible causes.\" Marraccini said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2005 Prius was part of Toyota's November recall to address the risk of accelerator pedal entrapment in the floor mat. Police say floor mats were not a factor in this particular accident, because they were secured to the seat with nylon ties. A recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the Prius.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoyt said he would not speculate about the accident's cause. The Prius is equipped with a brake override feature. \"When everything in the car is working correctly, the brakes will override the engine,\" Hoyt said. \"You have to draw your own conclusions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHoyt said Toyota will release the data from the black box recorder to the Harrison Police Department, but will not make it public because of privacy and legal concerns. Marraccini said police will make a determination after their investigation how much of the data to make public. \"If there's definitive information that shows the cause of this accident, absolutely we'll have to release it,\" Marraccini said.",

I see this world record as a personal one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA driven and focused competitor, she has also become famous for her coolness under pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore her latest world record jump she was driving around the track in the back of a vintage car with sprinter Asafa Powell, while her fellow competitors had already started the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot shy of media and publicity, her sporting achievements, athleticism and looks have made her a pin-up for women's athletics and attracted a number of big-name sponsors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile her achievements can be allied to that of Bubka it has been noted that her media- and sponsor-friendly attitude makes her more akin to compatriot Maria Sharapova.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer celebrity status is a world away from her modest background. Born in Volgograd in 1982 it was only until a couple of years ago that she lived with her parents and younger sister in the city of her birth, before moving to Monte Carlo.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe trained first of all as a gymnast until the age of 15 when her coach decided she was too tall. Commentators and fellow competitors have noted that her gymnastic training has helped give her an extra edge in the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter defending her title in Beijing, her place in the sporting pantheon of great female athletes seems secure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile emulating Bubka, Isinbayeva has said before that closing the gap between the heights the men and women can jump is another of her personal challenges, and with her own talent and the help of Bubka's former coach she may go a long way towards achieving that.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A satellite whose orbit is degrading is likely to crash back to Earth on Friday, and 26 pieces have a good chance of surviving the heat of re-entry, NASA said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being pretty sure that the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, or UARS, will re-enter the atmosphere sometime Friday afternoon, U.S. time, NASA says there is no way to know where it will fall.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes, even minutes before re-entry, it will be impossible to pinpoint an exact location, Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team said Wednesday. On top of that, he said, \"part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA says most of the six-ton spacecraft is made of aluminum, which has a relatively low melting temperature and will burn up on re-entry. But about half a ton of material is likely to make it through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are some pieces that are made of stainless steel and titanium and beryllium that have very high melting temperatures, and those pieces will survive,\" Matney said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said NASA has identified 26 pieces, ranging from tens of pounds to a few hundred pounds, that could make it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause water covers about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, NASA believes most, if not all the debris that survives will land in an ocean or sea. And even if pieces strike dry land, there's very little risk any will hit people.\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects this size re-enter the Earth's atmosphere about once a year, according to NASA. This is the largest NASA satellite to re-enter in about 30 years, but at six tons, it's only a fraction of the size of the 75-ton Skylab that fell back to Earth in 1979. Portions of it hit Western Australia.",

They were able to persuade him to release 10 hostages, leaving two behind, Meloni said.\n\n\n\n\"At one point the suspect began to close the blinds from inside the bank and he disconnected the phone contact with the hostage negotiators,\" Meloni said.\n\n\n\nShortly afterward, about 4:15 p.m., officers heard a single gunshot and they rushed in, Meloni said. He said the man was dead of a single gunshot wound to the head.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Central DuPage Hospital, Amy Steinbruecker, said the hospital treated and released the police officer who scuffled with the suspect for minor injuries.\n\n\n\nTelevision footage showed dozens of people running from the four-story bank building, which includes other businesses, with their hands above their heads.\n\n\n\n\"We locked our office door, turned off the lights, drew the blinds,\" said Donna Price, 52, of McHenry, who works in the office building. \"Then we heard a knock on the door and it was a SWAT guy. He told us to get out right now.\n\n\n\n\"I said, 'Let me get my purse.' He said, 'No, now.\"'\n\n\n\nPrice said police held people in a stairwell of the building before ordering them out.\n\n\n\n\"We all had to put our hands up on the back of our heads and run,\" Price said from a convenience store across the street where more than 100 people were crowded.",

The blaze, which grew to more than 20,100 acres, was 5 percent contained early Sunday, officials said. It was upgraded to type 1 brush fire -- the most severe classification.\n\n\n\n\"Today what happened is what I called a perfect storm of fuels, weather and topography coming together ... essentially the fire burned at will,\" Mike Dietrich of the U.S. Forest Service said Saturday.\n\n\n\nAuthorities consider the Station fire an anomaly, as it is not driven by strong winds as most California wildfires.  Watch CNN's Reynolds Wolf explain what's driving the fire \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"The fire has been very active on all fronts,\" U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Randi Jorgensen said.\n\n\n\nThe fire threatened about 10,000 homes in Los Angeles County and 900 homes were evacuated, she said.  Watch close-up views of the fast-moving fire \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Basically, all the homes that back up to the National Forest in the La Canada-Flintridge are in danger from the fire,\" Jorgensen said, adding that fire officials have told residents to be prepared for possible evacuation orders.\n\n\n\nThe Station fire disrupted power to 750 homes. More than 750 workers have been dispatched to control the blaze, which started Wednesday afternoon.  Watch iReport images and descriptions of the fire \u00bb\n\n\n\nJorgensen confirmed one injury involving heat exhaustion.\n\n\n\nA wildfire also hit San Bernardino National Forest, burning 2,200 acres, fire officials said. The blaze, called the Cottonwood fire, started Thursday afternoon about 10 miles from the southern California city of Hemet, officials reported. That blaze was about 10 percent contained Friday evening. Hemet is about 85 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nFirefighters fully contained another fire that torched 230 acres about 20 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles on Friday. The blaze, called the Palos Verdes fire, forced 1,200 people to evacuate and destroyed five homes and two other buildings.\n\n\n\nAnother fire in the Angeles National Forest had burned more than 2,100 acres. The blaze, called the Morris fire, started Tuesday. That fire was about 85 percent contained Friday evening, officials said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Flamboyant and fearless, Roberto Cavalli is the peacock of the fashion world; with his body-hugging clothes, he woos women the world over.\n\n\n\nFashion designer Roberto Cavalli\n\n\n\nBut his clients are no dainty damsels: Cavalli's women are Amazonian warriors and Grecian goddesses, whose armor is fashion and whose weapon is sex. His colorful creations are unabashed celebrations of the female form: dresses slashed to the hip or barely skimming the buttocks, necklines that plunge where no other designer dares.\n\n\n\nCavalli's woman knows she looks fabulous, and isn't afraid to show it: to her, it's not just clothing, it's an announcement that she's arrived.\n\n\n\nBorn in Florence in 1940, Cavalli was immersed in an intensely creative environment from childhood. That influence came from his father, a tailor, and his artist grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, whose work is shown in the famous Uffizi Galleries.\n\n\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Cavalli studied textile design at the local art institute. By the early 70s, he had developed an innovative technique for printing on lightweight leather, and his Florentine flair had led to commissions with Hermes and Pierre Cardin.\n\n\n\nIn 1970, he presented his first namesake collection at the Salon for Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter in Paris. His trademark work with unconventional fabrics like embellished denim and leather, mixed with wild animal prints and exotic patterns, was embraced by the jet set and Cavalli opened his first boutique in Saint Tropez in 1972.\n\n\n\nCavalli married his wife, Eva Duringer, a former Miss Universe, in 1980; she is now his business partner and right-hand woman.\n\n\n\nHis fondness for bright color, exotics, fur and bold prints -- which he designs in his factory on the outskirts of Florence -- have won him a name as the king of fashion excess. Beloved by A-listers and pop princesses, these are not clothes for the shy: this is old-school glamour, infused with power, wielded by women who have flounced and shimmied their way to the top.  See Cavalli's designs on the catwalk \u00bb\n\n\n\nHis main line is sold in over 50 countries worldwide, along with his diffusion lines RC Menswear and Just Cavalli, plus a children's line, knitwear, accessories, eyewear, watches, perfumes, underwear and beachwear. He's even ventured into Cavalli-branded vodka and wine.\n\n\n\nHis collaboration with high-street fashion store H&M in November 2007 caused stampedes as his fans flocked to get their hands on his creations, desperate to capture some of that Cavalli magic at tiny prices.\n\n\n\nSome have asked whether his latest collections have taken a more gentle direction -- but the tiger's inner fire still burns bright. Spring/Summer 2008's bold flower prints and flirty feathered dresses were followed by Autumn/Winter 2008's flowered dresses that at first glance appear dewy and fresh -- but look closer, and the hip-hugging cut belies their innocence.\n\n\n\nCavalli is adored by his celebrity clientele, who flaunt his show-stopping creations on red carpets from Los Angeles to Sydney. Fans of his work include Halle Berry, Sharon Stone, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Beyonc\u00e8 Knowles, Charlize Theron and Victoria Beckham.\n\n\n\nIf anyone sums up the glamour and glitz of show business, it's Cavalli: fashion as theatre, shameless decadence where the whole world is a stage. That's underlined by his eponymous 133'9\" long yacht, built 2004, and color-coordinated, naturally, with his helicopter and fleet of cars.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For 8-year-old Ryan Mohar, an elevator isn't just an elevator. He spends hours pressing the buttons and riding up and down, preferring this to the slew of alternatives that his teachers offer -- even candy.\n\n\n\nRyan Mohar, who has autism, gets treated with ABA approaches at the Marcus Autism Center.\n\n\n\nRyan is one of many American children with autism, a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors or limited interests, and difficulties with communication and social interactions.\n\n\n\nAt the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, Ryan and other children with communication and behavior difficulties get help through a rigorous empirical method called Applied Behavior Analysis.\n\n\n\n\"Decades of research has shown that that is the treatment of choice, and results in the best gains in terms of skill acquisition and behavior problem reduction for kids with autism and other developmental disabilities,\" said Alice Shillingsburg, program coordinator of the center's Language and Learning Clinic.\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness and nature of ABA is particularly relevant as many parents fight for insurance companies to cover it and other autism treatments. The organization Autism Speaks has endorsed bills in 25 states that would require private health insurance policies to cover the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders for anyone under the age of 21. The legislation would specifically be targeted at ABA and other structured autism therapies. Only eight states have autism insurance reform, according to Autism Speaks.\n\n\n\nWhile ABA encompasses a broad range of practices of studying and changing behavior, the one usually associated with autism is called discrete trial instruction. A trial consists of a cue, the opportunity to respond and a reward.  Watch therapists using applied behavior analysis on Ryan \u00bb\n\n\n\nFor example, a therapist might try to teach a child who likes sweets to request candy. The trial gets repeated over and over so that the child learns that candy comes only as a result of the request. The clinicians at Marcus Autism Center carefully record how many trials the child successfully completes.  Learn more about autism \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"If suddenly they can emit some vocal response, and suddenly when they do that, candy appears -- someone delivers candy to them -- that's a very powerful response for that child,\" said Nathan Call, director of Behavior Treatment Clinics at the Marcus Autism Center.\n\n\n\nAnalysts examine progress based on such data at least once a day -- sometimes five or six times a day -- and will change the treatment plan if necessary.\n\n\n\nIn Ryan's case, a trial begins when his clinical specialist takes him near the elevator and asks him to hand over a card -- his way of requesting access to the elevator. If Ryan gives the card, he gets to go to the elevator, and that is the end of one trial. If he does not, his helpers walk him away, and a new trial begins.\n\n\n\nExperts working with Ryan hope that teaching him to ask for the things he enjoys -- elevator rides, elevator buttons -- will help him stop running away, which he does even at home. In fact, Ryan wears a GPS-equipped ankle bracelet so that police can track him if he gets far from home.\n\n\n\nABA is very effective, but the term \"cure\" is inaccurate, experts said. Autism describes a broad range of characteristics, not an underlying cause, Call said. ABA techniques can produce significant behavior changes, however.\n\n\n\n\"The goal is not necessarily for the child to have hit all of their developmental milestones, necessarily, but rather it's hopefully to get them to a point where they're able to take advantage of a more typical or less restrictive educational environment,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStudies have shown that 60 percent of high-functioning children can lose their diagnosis of autism by age 8 by using ABA, according to the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a leading center in autism research and treatment in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\n\nNot everyone is so enthusiastic about ABA, however. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, associate professor of pediatric neurology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, cautions that the treatment should fit the child, and ABA may not work as well for some children as other types of therapy.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach is play-based therapy, whereby the therapist takes cues from the child rather than the other way around. For example, if a child is bouncing a ball, the therapist would take that as an opportunity to encourage the child to bounce the ball back to him or her, Wiznitzer said.\n\n\n\nOne of the pioneers of ABA is Ivar Lovaas, a child psychologist who in the 1960s began investigating how to help children who injured themselves. His research showed that components of ABA could reduce these behaviors.\n\n\n\nThe therapy has evolved since then, however. In the beginning, the approach to ABA was more dogmatic and \"cookie-cutter,\" Wiznitzer said. A child who cooperated got a reward, but a child who did not cooperate got a punishment such as yelling or a squirt of water.\n\n\n\n\"ABA in a classic sense is a very restricted, very limited program that has issues with the ability to generalize the learned skill outside of the ABA environment,\" he said. A family once told him that their child showed great restaurant manners -- but only in the basement, he said.\n\n\n\nToday, many analysts who use ABA as a guide go more with the flow of the needs of the child, he said.\n\n\n\nABA isn't just for children with autism -- the methods have been used for people of all ages, with and without disabilities.\n\n\n\nStaff members at Marcus Autism Center try to help children use the skills they learn outside of the artificial environment of the classroom.\n\n\n\n\"They're doing research here on finding the best way to create those moments where the child really needs information in order to complete a preferred task or to gain access to a preferred activity or a preferred outcome,\" Call said.\n\n\n\nAnother criticism of ABA is that children become mechanical because they learn to have only one specific response for a given prompt in real life. Call's response is that variability is just another behavior that can be taught, but noted that there are trade-offs. Parents have input in the decision to focus more on teaching a lot of different skills, rather than to teach several responses in any one situation.\n\n\n\n\"Oftentimes, the goal is to focus more on giving as many functional skills as possible to that child, so they can have as fulfilling a life as they can,\" Call said.\n\n\n\nABA is extremely costly, however. For the behavior clinics, therapy sessions at Marcus Autism Center begin at $60 per hour, and go higher in price depending on the expert who is providing the treatment -- a session with someone with a master's or doctorate may cost more.\n\n\n\nA person with autism costs society about $3.2 million over the course of his or her lifetime, according to a 2007 study in the journal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. Direct medical costs for the first five years are, on average, about $35,000, the study said.\n\n\n\nFor children from non-English-speaking families, two staff members at Marcus Autism Center speak Spanish, and an outside translator can be brought in if necessary for other languages, said Chris Tullis, a clinical specialist. But the Association for Behavior Analysis International told CNN that it does not have any \"board-certified therapists\" in Atlanta who report speaking Spanish.\n\n\n\nAs for Ryan, after only about two weeks at Marcus Autism Center, his screaming has come down from more than 200 times an hour to about 38, Call said.\n\n\n\n\"It looks promising, but we've got 10 more weeks to actually find out what's really going to work the best with Ryan,\" Tullis said.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors Tuesday urged a Florida judge to sentence actor Wesley Snipes to three years in prison and fine him $5 million to demonstrate to taxpayers that refusal to pay income taxes carries severe penalties.\n\n\n\nWesley Snipes was acquitted of the most serious charges against him.\n\n\n\nSnipes is scheduled to be sentenced April 24 by U.S. District Judge William Hodges in Ocala, Florida, on three counts of failure to file federal income tax returns.\n\n\n\nOne week after vowing to crack down on \"tax defiers,\" the Justice Department filed court papers seeking the maximum penalty for the three misdemeanor counts on which Snipes was convicted.\n\n\n\n\"This case presents the court with a singular opportunity to deter tax fraud nationwide,\" the government said in its sentencing recommendation.\n\n\n\nSnipes had been charged with felony conspiracy counts for participating in a scheme that rejects the legal foundation of the tax system. However, a jury accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers, and acquitted him on the most serious charges.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that Snipes was acquitted on two felony charges and convicted 'only' on three misdemeanor counts has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a 'victory' for Snipes,\" the government document says.\n\n\n\n\"The troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous Wesley Snipes has 'gotten away with it.' In the end the criminal conduct of Snipes must not be seen in such a light.\"\n\n\n\nAssistant Attorney General Nathan Hochman, head of the Justice Department's Tax Division, last week promised to beef up the government's efforts to pursue those engaged in a variety of schemes making legal assertions that income taxes are either voluntary or unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\"For nearly a decade Snipes has engaged in a campaign of criminal tax conduct combining brazen defiance with insidious concealment,\" the prosecutors say. \"By these means Snipes has escaped paying more than $15 million in income tax to the IRS and has pursued an intended fraudulent harm to the United States Treasury of more than $41 million.\"\n\n\n\nThe document says Snipes shipped millions of dollars to accounts in Switzerland, Antigua and the Isle of Man to avoid taxes.\n\n\n\n\"Given defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources, both disclosed and undisclosed, the United States submits that a fine of at least $5 million is warranted,\" the sentencing recommendation says.\n\n\n\nThe 35-page argument for the stiffest possible penalty ends with a dramatic flair.\n\n\n\n\"In the defendant Wesley Snipes, the court is presented with a wealthy, famous and inveterate tax scofflaw. If ever a tax offender was deserving of being held accountable to the maximum extent for his criminal wrongdoing, Snipes is that defendant,\" it says.\n\n\n\nThe IRS is also seeking repayment of all taxes and interest through civil court proceedings.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Call it a self-fulfilling prophecy: An estimated three-fourths of gas stations in the Nashville, Tennessee, area ran dry Friday, victim of an apparent rumor that the city was running out of gas.\n\n\"Everybody has just gone nuts,\" said Mike Williams, executive director of the Tennessee Petroleum Council.\n\nHe said he has no idea about the origin of a rumor that there was going to be no gas in Nashville. One reporter called him, saying she had heard that Nashville would be without gas within the hour, he said.\n\nHearing the rumor, drivers rushed to fill their cars and trucks.\n\nCNN called 13 Nashville gas stations at random. Only two reported having gas, and one said it was almost out. The stations said they were being told they would not get more until Monday or Tuesday. iReport.com: Nashville residents desperate for fuel\n\nKatie Givens Kime, visiting from Atlanta, Georgia, was trying to fill up her tank for the trip home when she ran into trouble -- when she was already low on gas.\n\n\"We panicked and looked online,\" she said. \"And holy cow, there is no gas in the city. ... It has definitely gripped the city, for sure.\"\n\nOne store clerk told her there was no way she could get gas to go back home, she said.\n\nWilliams said some drivers were following gas trucks to see where they were headed, and lines at some stations were a mile long. Fuel was continuing to enter the city, however, as pipelines were working and barges were coming in.\n\nHe likened it to Southerners rushing out to stock up on bread and milk when they hear it might snow. As stations began running low, the situation snowballed, he said.\n\nOne station reported selling as much gas Friday as it usually does in a weekend, Williams said.\n\nThe phenomenon seemed to be isolated to the Nashville area, he said. iReport.com: Is there a gas panic in your area?\n\nGivens Kime said she found a station online that still had gas and waited more than an hour to pump it.\n\n\"People were freaked out,\" she said. A \"renegade bunch\" of men helped direct traffic to and from the pumps, even taking drivers' cash inside for them. She described people filling cans and other containers as well as cars.\n\nShe said that the station was not engaging in price gouging but that \"emotions were running very high\" among drivers.\n\nCNN's Gary Bender contributed to this report.",

She was 3 years old at the time.\n\n\n\nThe suspicious woman was seen outside a bar in Barcelona, Spain, by partygoers on May 7, 2007, and the new witness had a conversation with this woman, said McCann family spokesman Clarence Mitchell.  Watch McCann spokesman describe new lead \u00bb\n\n\n\nAuthorities released a sketch of the person, described as a woman who spoke with an Australian accent and who could also speak fluent Spanish.\n\n\n\nFormer detective inspector Dave Edgar, who was hired by the McCann family, called the new witness a significant movement in the case.\n\n\n\nEdgar would not say why the witness waited so long to come forward, stating only it was personal reasons.\n\n\n\nMitchell described the woman they are looking for as similar in appearance to the former Spice Girl singer and wife of soccer star David Beckham. She was described as in her 30s and about 5 feet 2 inches tall.\n\n\n\nMadeleine's parents have garnered international support in an effort to find their daughter, enlisting the aid of celebrities and even Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n\nAt one point, authorities in Portugal had named the girl's parents as suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said in July 2008 that authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them suspects.\n\n\n\nPortuguese investigators closed the case in July 2008.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Many Google users probably didn't notice this month that they can now display their search tips in the Hawaiian language.\n\n\n\nHawaiian is one of more than 125 \"interface languages\" now available on Google.\n\n\n\nWedged between Hausa and Hebrew, Hawaiian is one of more than 125 \"interface languages\" now available on Google. The list also includes some humorous twists on English, including \"pirate,\" \"Klingon\" and \"Elmer Fudd.\"\n\n\n\nBut for Hawaiian educators, the addition of Hawaiian is a small step toward legitimizing a language that is considered \"critically endangered\" by the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\"It's the capstone of a lot of work,\" said Keola Donaghy, an assistant professor of Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii-Hilo.\n\n\n\n\"We've been doing this work for 18 years, simply trying to make it easier for people who speak Hawaiian to use these kinds of technologies.\"\n\n\n\nIt marks the first native American language available through the \"Google in Your Language\" program.\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\n\nIt took Donaghy several years to get the project off the ground through the \"Google in Your Language\" program, which was launched by the California-based company not long after it was founded in 1998.\n\n\n\n\"The idea was to enable users worldwide to be able to access Google in the language of their choice, and if it wasn't available, to enable users to help make it so,\" Google spokesman Nate Tyler said. \"Why limit users to a set of dominant languages if they were willing to help make Google their own?\"\n\n\n\nThe results of the search are still in English, although the user can select a preference for Web pages written in more than 40 other main languages.\n\n\n\nGoogle works with linguists like Donaghy who are interested in translating search instructions into their language.\n\n\n\n\"Volunteers sign up on their own to provide translation,\" Tyler explained. \"They simply sign themselves up, declare a language proficiency, and then start translating or reviewing the products that are available for volunteer translation.\n\n\n\n\"When the translations are completed, we make the product(s) available in that language. Recent other languages like this include Maori language.\"\n\n\n\nIt was the Maori project, launched last year, that actually helped get Donaghy's initiative off the ground.\n\n\n\nThree years ago, Donaghy started e-mailing and calling Google about a Hawaiian language project, but he got no response. He put the project on hold until last year.\n\n\n\n\"When I heard the Maori version came out, I asked Google about it,\" Donaghy said. \"Apparently the original (language) coordinator had gone and as soon as a new coordinator was brought online, they set up the system.\"\n\n\n\nDonaghy began working on the massive translation project sometime late last year.\n\n\n\n\"It was whenever I could find an hour or two in between teaching or other duties,\" he said. \"It was a combination of personal and work time.\"\n\n\n\nHe spent more than 100 hours translating the search terms that appear on the Google page into Hawaiian through the program.\n\n\n\n\"I did the actual translation from beginning to end, and then I consulted with my colleagues at the university who have worked on these projects in the past,\" Donaghy said.\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to be very consistent -- such as how you say 'Go to this menu and select this' -- or people may become confused.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's Hawaiian for 'browsing' the Web'?\n\n\n\nSome of the Hawaiian words for terms such as \"links\" or \"Web browser\" had already been established when Donaghy and others worked on translating the Netscape Navigator search engine in 1997.\n\n\n\n\"Over the years, we usually face the debate of do we want to 'Hawaiianize' an English word, or take an old Hawaiian word and give it a new meaning,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe explained some of the challenges in translating terms, such as \"browsing\" or \"surfing,\" into Hawaiian.\n\n\n\n\"People use the term 'surf the Internet' and they'll say 'he'e nalu' which is literally surfing the ocean out on a board,\" he explained. \"But we use 'kele,' which is what you do when you're steering a canoe. So we chose that as you're navigating the net.\"\n\n\n\nDonaghy finished the translation project in April, but there were issues with the code for the search engine that would not activate the Hawaiian language interface.\n\n\n\nThe Hawaiian language interface actually launched on Apple's Safari browser first because Donaghy had worked with Apple to ensure that the language's diacritical marks and characters were available on the company's computers.\n\n\n\n\"Now, it comes with every computer that they ship,\" he said.  See and hear phrases in Hawaiian \u00bb\n\n\n\nSome Apple computer users who had selected Hawaiian as their primary language for other programs noticed a couple of weeks ago that Google's search terms started appearing in Hawaiian, too.\n\n\n\n\"People started calling me and asking, 'Did you hack into my computer? My Google is in Hawaiian,'\" Donaghy said. \"And that was the point I said, 'OK, word is getting out about this' and I put out a news release. I was afraid someone was going to start freaking out, 'Why is my computer in Hawaiian?'\"\n\n\n\nImportant milestone for Hawaii's culture\n\n\n\nThe initiative is an important milestone for Hawaiian linguists and cultural educators who have pushed to have their native language taught in schools alongside English.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until the 1980s that the law banning the Hawaiian language from being taught in schools was overturned. The law was established in the late 19th century as a prerequisite to Hawaii becoming a U.S. territory.\n\n\n\nToday, more and more Hawaiians are studying and majoring in Hawaiian language programs. There are Hawaiian language immersion programs in which English is taught as a second language.\n\n\n\nMona Wood, a Hawaiian speaker and owner of a public relations firm in Honolulu, said there has been a kind of Hawaiian language \"renaissance\" in the state since the late 1970s.\n\n\n\n\"Even tourism has been learning and growing and realizing that our 'host culture' must be added to the visitor experience,\" Wood said. \"There are many more programs available at hotels and shopping malls that weren't there 20 years ago.\"\n\n\n\nWood said that when she studied Hawaiian in college, it was under the foreign languages department.\n\n\n\n\"It has been so wonderful to see so many of our youth embrace the native culture and see the programs expand to the point where there is an entire Hawaiian Studies Department,\" she said. \"One can now get a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) and M.A. (Master of Arts) in Hawaiian language.\"\n\n\n\nWood -- who owns Ikaika Communications, which represents local officials, local and national companies and celebrities including Duane \"Dog the Bounty Hunter\" Chapman -- said that when she was growing up, \"Our culture was dying in every way.\"\n\n\n\n\"Learning my roots came through my own curiosity -- choosing to take hula lessons when my mom wanted me to take piano,\" she said. \"Then I went to the Hawaiian High School, Kamehameha, and continued with some Hawaiian classes and joined a club at UH (University of Hawaii).\n\n\n\n\"Seeing Hawaiian knowledge becoming an asset over the years has been truly satisfying,\" she said.\n\n\n\nDonaghy hopes the Google initiative is another step toward giving Hawaiian \"the same status as English and other major European and Asian languages\" -- particularly in the fast-moving sector of technology.\n\n\n\n\"To me personally it's very important that we are giving the opportunity to have as many things in Hawaiian as in English,\" he said. \"So if we had not begun to address technology in the early 1990s, we would be telling people that this is a place where Hawaiian doesn't belong. You have to revert to English.\n\n\n\n\"We didn't want to send that kind of message so we've worked to make the language more accessible.\"",

  "context": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian mafia boss used his pet crocodile to threaten people and extort money, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe caiman was 1.1 meters long (3.6 feet), the Italian Forest Service said.\n\n\n\nAntonio Cristofaro kept the 40-kilogram (88-pound) reptile on a terrace of his home near Naples and fed it live rats and rabbits, according to LAV, an Italian animal rights group.\n\n\n\nAuthorities discovered the animal during a search for weapons at Cristofaro's home, LAV said. The crocodile was found on September 18 but the news was only made public Wednesday, the group said.\n\n\n\nThe crocodile was 1.1 meters long (3.6 feet), the Italian Forest Service said, and was capable of pulling off a man's limb with one bite. It lived atop Cristofaro's condominium in Caserta, less than an hour northeast of Naples, the Forest Service said.\n\n\n\nCristofaro used the crocodile to intimidate people, notably entrepreneurs, to pay him more money, Italy's ANSA news agency reported.\n\n\n\nThe crocodile is of a type known as a caiman, commonly found in Latin America. It is protected under the Washington Convention, which regulates the international trade of endangered animals, and is considered too dangerous to own as a pet, the Forest Service said.\n\n\n\nPolice charged Cristofaro with illegal possession of animals, ANSA said. It was not clear whether he had been arrested.\n\n\n\nThe Forest Service is now holding the reptile at an animal center near Rome, ANSA reported.\n\n\n\nCristofaro, who the Forest Service said comes from a mafia family, already had a criminal record for weapons-related charges, resisting police, and extortion, ANSA reported.\n\n\n\nAuthorities found a flak jacket during a search of Cristofaro's house, the Forest Service said.\n\n\n\nIt was not the first time the Forest Service discovered an illegal crocodile at someone's home, the Forest Service said. In August 2008 in Naples, authorities found a 2-meter-long (6.5-foot-long) crocodile at the home of a man known for drug dealing, they said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.",

Efforts by CNN to reach Coderre have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\nA resort spokeswoman said a statement was being prepared in response to the latest report.\n\n\n\nAn earlier statement from the resort said a paramedic from its ski patrol \"arrived on the scene within minutes\" after Richardson, 45, fell during a lesson on a beginners' trail.\n\n\n\nThe ski patrol paramedic \"did not find any visible sign of injury,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\"As standard protocol, the ski patrol insisted Ms. Richardson be transported to the base of the hill in a rescue toboggan,\" it said. \"Once at the base of the hill, Ms. Richardson was advised by staff to consider seeking additional medical attention which was declined.\"\n\n\n\nThe resort's statement said Richardson, accompanied by her instructor, returned to her hotel but about an hour after the fall was \"not feeling good,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nAnother ambulance was later called to the hotel, where paramedics found her conscious, but she \"wasn't in good shape,\" Coderre said.\n\n\n\nRichardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal. From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.\n\n\n\nShe and her husband, actor Liam Neeson, have two children, Michael and Daniel.\n\n\n\nHer family issued a short statement Wednesday night acknowledging her death.\n\n\n\n\"Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.\"\n\n\n\nRichardson is a member of acting royalty. Her grandfather, Sir Michael Redgrave, was a famed British actor. Her mother, Vanessa Redgrave, is an Oscar-winning actress, and her father, late director Tony Richardson, helmed such films as \"Look Back in Anger,\" \"The Entertainer\" and the Oscar-winning \"Tom Jones.\"  Watch a review of her career \u00bb\n\n\n\nRichardson's uncle Corin Redgrave, aunt Lynn Redgrave and sister Joely Richardson are also noted performers.\n\n\n\nNatasha Richardson won a Tony for her performance as Sally Bowles in the 1998 revival of \"Cabaret\" and earned raves for her Blanche DuBois in a 2005 production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\"\n\n\n\nShe was scheduled to perform in a revival of Stephen Sondheim's \"A Little Night Music\" this year, after a January benefit performance of the show.\n\n\n\nBroadway dimmed its lights Thursday evening in tribute to Richardson.",

Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations.\n\nThe latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble.\n\nThe workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union.\n\nThey did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN.\n\nOne hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building.\n\nThe released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said.\n\nThe four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.\n\nAbout 500 employees were also outside the building protesting.\n\nA top Caterpillar executive called the hostage-taking unhelpful.\n\n\"The actions that are taking place today, led by a small minority of individuals, are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation,\" said Chris Schena, Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, in a statement.\n\n\"The best way to resolve this matter is to continue the negotiations through the Works Council to find a solution that's fair to our employees and allows Caterpillar to remain a leader in a rapidly changing global marketplace,\" Schena said, adding that the company was \"concerned for the safety of our employees.\"\n\nBenoit said all the workers wanted to do was negotiate with Caterpillar and they were upset that the company did not show up to two earlier scheduled negotiating sessions.\n\nThe employees being held in their office were being allowed to get food, Benoit added.\n\nPolice arrived at the scene two hours after the incident began but it had not been settled.\n\nEmployees at a French 3M factory held a manager hostage for more than 24 hours Wednesday and Thursday of last week over a dispute about terms for laid-off staff.\n\nLuc Rousselet, who was unharmed, was allowed to leave the plant in Pithiviers, central France, early on Thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from 3M France.\n\nEarlier this month, the boss of Sony France was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed.\n\nFrance has been hit by nationwide strikes twice in the past two months.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- President Obama built his push for a sweeping overhaul of the health care system on the premise that reform is essential for economic recovery.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has said overhauling health care is a key part of economic recovery.\n\n\n\nBut with some economists saying the recession shows signs of ending, will that weaken Obama's argument?\n\n\n\n\"If the economy is picking up, then more people are going to get jobs and more people are going to have health insurance, and so they are going to be less concerned with health care reform because they will figure, 'I'm taken care of,' \" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\n\n\nBut Julian Epstein, a Democratic strategist, said a recovering economy will help Obama's push for health care legislation because \"it will be a huge shot in the arm for Obama's political capital.\"\n\n\n\n\"It lessens people's anxieties that are being stirred up by the opponents of health care reform. It gives credibility to the argument that government has an appropriate role to play in solving the nation's problems,\" Epstein said.\n\n\n\nObama ran on a campaign to fix the health care system, and since taking office, the president repeatedly has tried to show how this overhaul fits into his broader economic strategy.\n\n\n\nIn a speech in June before the American Medical Association, Obama warned that inaction could have dire consequences.\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake: The cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It is an escalating burden on our families and businesses. It is a ticking time bomb for the federal budget. And it is unsustainable for the United States of America,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhile the president has said health care is his top domestic priority this year, the public seems to disagree.\n\n\n\nEighty-three percent of people are satisfied with their current health care, and 74 percent are satisfied with their health insurance, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released last week.\n\n\n\n\"Health care reform has not been the top priority for voters. No. 1 is jobs. No. 2 is the deficit and government spending. Health care is third,\" said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst.\n\n\n\nBut Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and director of American studies at Georgetown University, said the public isn't as concerned about the economics-driven case to overhaul health care.\n\n\n\n\"I personally think that the vast majority of the public doesn't get that connection between the economy and health care. I think they're seeing it more as a personal issue -- something that could affect them, their families, their friends,\" she said, noting that because people have an emotional involvement in the debate, the public is not likely to let it drop.\n\n\n\nThat personal anxiety has manifested itself at town hall meetings across the country, where, angry protesters and other citizens have showed up to voice their doubts to their lawmakers. Voters have asked their lawmakers what reform means for them -- and how they can be assured that Obama's proposals are good ideas.\n\n\n\nThe August congressional recess, however, could end up being a blessing in disguise for Democrats, Epstein said.\n\n\n\n\"It may persuade enough of them that they do need to be more moderate and incremental in the approach, and they may actually come up with a package that is even more popular than what would have otherwise been, had they tried to get the bill through before August,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIf the economy recovers, plenty of Republicans and even a few Democrats will remind voters that Obama was wrong about the importance of reform to economic recovery, Schneider said. \"What will Obama say? That the recovery cannot be sustained over the long term without health care reform.\"\n\n\n\nObama sent a similar message in his radio address last weekend, citing the slightly better than expected job numbers as \"a sign that we've begun to put the brakes on this recession and that the worst may be behind us.\"\n\n\n\n\"But we must do more than rescue our economy from this immediate crisis; we must rebuild it stronger than before. We must lay a new foundation for future growth and prosperity, and a key pillar of a new foundation is health insurance reform -- reform that we are now closer to achieving than ever before,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBut even if the effort does take on a lower profile, it could still have real consequences for Democrats, as it did 15 years ago, Schneider said.\n\n\n\nPresident Clinton's push to overhaul health care failed, and the issue faded from the agenda as the economy recovered, but the ramifications were felt in the next election cycle.\n\n\n\n\"Clinton had to scale back his agenda. His big ideas for health care reform turned into protecting 'the safety net.' And, of course, the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years, and it took them another 12 years to get it back,\" Schneider said.",

It's the first game wholly developed without intervention from Bungie, the company that created \"Halo\" but which has since severed ties with Microsoft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Halo Anniversary\" is available only for the Xbox 360 starting Tuesday, the 10th anniversary of the original \"Halo,\" which launched alongside Microsoft's first home gaming console.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game adds high-definition graphics and a big-production musical score to the original, without changing much else.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducers often look at remakes as a way to add their signature to a well-regarded work, but the team shepherding \"Halo\" went to extraordinary lengths to preserve the feel of its decade-old model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank O'Connor, a development director for 343 Industries, the division Microsoft created to specifically handle the \"Halo\" franchise, stressed that \"Halo Anniversary\" was created to appease fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $40 price tag, versus the standard $60 price for new games, fits with that model. \"This is a celebration of the past.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Connor leads a team of a few people within 343 Industries that's tasked with making the final say about whether a storyline for new games, books and other media fits with \"the Halo canon,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith several bestselling books and more products in the works, this is a fragile process.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes O'Connor has to temper his own instincts in order to stay true to precedents set by earlier games. For example, he wanted to hide a rocket launcher behind a waterfall in the second level of \"Halo Anniversary\" as an Easter egg for explorers. His team challenged him on it, and so he conceded: no rockets, he lamented as he motioned to the waterfall while demonstrating the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a familiar but unique 'Halo 4'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team within 343 Industries that's working on \"Halo 4,\" the major new game scheduled to be released late next year, has been given more creative freedom than the external group that's programming \"Halo Anniversary.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKiki Wolfkill, the executive producer for \"Halo 4,\" said that being able to consult with O'Connor's team makes it \"incredibly easy\" to keep their stories straight. But Josh Holmes, the creative director for the game, said that despite the help, the breadth of the \"Halo\" franchise creates a minefield for storytellers to traverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are times when we're thinking about all of the different interconnected storylines,\" Holmes said. \"That's really important to us, because we believe in the universe and want to keep the universe consistent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey declined to talk much about \"Halo 4,\" but they said it will strike a delicate balance between keeping up with innovations in other first-person-shooter games and keeping the mechanics familiar to fans of the series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game will have a familiar control scheme, using two analog sticks for movement, rather than doing a drastic departure with, say, Kinect camera navigation, 343 Industries executives said. It may incorporate limited Kinect functions for throwing grenades or toggling settings using voice commands, like those in \"Halo Anniversary,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things that's really important to us is that the game feels, at its core, like 'Halo,' \" Holmes said. \"It feels like 'Halo,' yet it feels new and unique.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying true to 'Halo' in 'Anniversary' edition\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same criteria are not what's driving \"Halo Anniversary.\" The primary concern for developers was that it feel almost identical to the original \"Halo.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne roadblock that Saber Interactive, the team behind the single-player element of \"Halo Anniversary,\" ran into was a result of running an old game on the Xbox 360's faster hardware, O'Connor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game just felt smoother and speedier, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the team tweaked the code in order to reproduce glitches found in the original.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If things like that happen with physics or animation, and we go change it, then we're changing the game,\" O'Connor said after watching an alien in the game make an unintentional, jittery movement. \"Some things we had to go back and break to make it authentic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut like O'Connor's failed attempt at hiding a rocket launcher, Saber wanted to do more. O'Connor and his team had to talk the developers out of overreaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They just wanted to put their own stamp on it,\" O'Connor said. \"But we said, 'This isn't about putting your stamp or our stamp.' \"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew features for 'Halo Anniversary'\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the characters and scenes from the first \"Halo\" have been re-created with an attention to detail that takes advantage of the Xbox 360's processor, \"Halo Anniversary\" players can switch to the vintage look at any time, except during video sequences. This results in a brief pause, but it can be a welcome distraction throughout the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feature lets players compare today's standards to what was cutting edge a decade ago. At some points, like in grassy environments, the original holds up surprisingly well, but the aesthetic changes in \"Halo Anniversary\" aren't just for show. Lighting effects and brighter textures on walls were used to guide the player along in places where it was once difficult to navigate. These changes are not likely to upset even sensitive fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps more controversial, the developers made some significant alterations to a particular character and added video terminals throughout the game. Both were done for the purpose of broadening the plot and for relating it to games and books that have come out since the first game, O'Connor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe floating blue-and-metallic orb named 343 Guilty Spark, which Microsoft's 343 Industries took its name from, has received a sort of makeover. The wisecracking robot, which guides players through certain levels but was known to stray, has been made more visible and talkative. His lines have been updated to hint at story elements from books and future games, O'Connor said. Likewise, the terminals placed throughout the levels, another element not found in the original, let players watch short clips that hint at events in \"Halo 4\" and other \"Halo\" media, O'Connor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe online multiplayer component in \"Halo Anniversary\" has more in common with \"Halo: Reach\" than it does with the original. It uses the same \"Reach\" game engine that was designed by Bungie. Certain Affinity, an Austin, Texas, game developer, rebuilt versions of a few maps and weapons from the first \"Halo\" to be played with friends. \"Halo: Reach\" owners will be able to access the modes for free.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe true test: Fan appraisals\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can never quite gauge how fans will react to seeing one of their beloved entertainment artifacts recreated for a new generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember when George Lucas remastered \"Star Wars\" in the late 1990s? \"Han shot first,\" a reference to a particular scene from the original movie that was changed, remains the bane of many geeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle-eye followers of \"Halo\" have begun grumbling over the addition of metallic fins lining the bottom of the ring that surrounds the planet in the game. Execs from 343 Industries initially said the fins were present in the first game but not visible due to the low graphic resolution. In fact, the fins are an important element of the plot in the Greg Bear novel \"Halo: Primordium,\" which is set to come out in January, O'Connor said. Without them, the game would be inconsistent with the book.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \"Star Wars\" fans nervously await the three-dimensional remakes that are in the works, \"Halo Anniversary\" players with television sets that support the feature will get to play in 3-D glory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Halo Anniversary\" and \"Star Wars\" have one more thing in common. The musical score for the new \"Halo\" game was recorded using Lucas' Skywalker Symphony Orchestra. \"Halo Anniversary\" includes the ability to switch back to the music from the original game, \"though I don't see why you'd want to,\" O'Connor said.",

Jeff Connor of the Major Case Squad.\n\n\n\nConnor heads the squad that is part of the St. Louis, Missouri, homicide task force. He made the comments during an appearance on HLN's Nancy Grace.\n\n\n\nPolice found the bodies of Sheri Coleman and the children, Garret, 11, and Gavin, 9, in the bedrooms of their two-floor home in the St. Louis suburb of Columbia, Illinois, on the morning of May 7. Indications were they had been strangled.\n\n\n\nThe killings shocked the suburb of about 10,000 residents. The Monroe County, Illinois, state's attorney's office is awaiting forensic test results, more interviews, documents and reports, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch.  Watch Nancy Grace on the case \u00bb\n\n\n\nConnor said threatening messages were found on the walls inside the home, but he would not disclose the exact wording.\n\n\n\nAccording to Connor, Christopher Coleman -- the boys' father and Sheri Coleman's husband -- left the house at 5:43 a.m., and drove to a gym to work out. \"Shortly thereafter he started calling his house, realized that nobody was answering and on his way back at around 6:50 is when he made the phone call to the Columbia Police Department,\" Connor said.\n\n\n\nConnor said Coleman told police he started calling his house shortly after leaving it because he \"was making sure the kids were getting up for school.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- CNN's Larry King talked with former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday night at the William Jefferson Clinton Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Clinton talked politics and more with CNN's Larry King on Tuesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, King talked with Clinton about the stimulus bill, the auto bailout, President Barack Obama's BlackBerry, Chelsea Clinton's future, Sarah Palin and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry King: The stimulus bill passed today [Tuesday]. The president signed it in Denver. Is it going to work?\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Clinton:  I think it will do what it's designed to do. And I think it's important that the American people understand what it's designed to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's supposed to do three things.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber one, put money in people's pockets who are in trouble now -- extended unemployment benefits, the modest tax cuts, increase in food stamps. That will help grocery stores and other businesses and keep Americans who are good, honest, hardworking people afloat.  Watch Larry King's interview with Bill Clinton \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second thing it's supposed to do is give a chunk of money to state and local governments, primarily for education and health. That is designed to make sure that they don't have to either have big tax increases or lay a million people off. Either one, in this economy, would be bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third thing it will do is to create jobs through existing road and bridge contracts, through rail improvements, through modernization and especially through clean energy and energy efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I think that given how fast it had to be done and the compromises that had to be made, it's quite a good bill. And I think it will do what it's designed to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: John McCain and others on the other side of the ledger are saying that he didn't come forward enough to the Republicans, he didn't make them part of this Easter basket.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: Well, I disagree with that. I think the only way he could have gotten a lot of them to vote for him would be to accept their economic theory. Their economic theory is why we're in this mess in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: Do you resent it when the Bush people say that this problem started with you, it started in your administration?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: Well, they don't have much evidence for that. I always answer, does anyone seriously believe if the team I had in place had been in place for the last eight years that this would have happened? And the answer to that is no. We had a much more vigorous regulatory environment with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We were watching these derivatives. I do think we should have done more on derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: Before we move on to other things, should taxpayers be bailing out the automakers?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: We don't owe it to them. We should only do it if it's in our interests. I believe it's in our interests ...\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: We keep hearing about Obama's BlackBerry -- he's got a special BlackBerry now that doesn't have to be recorded into the White House. Do you have the number?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: No. No.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: Would you like the number?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: I know that in the world that exists today, if you're hyper-busy, you need them. Hillary lives on hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: Do you have one?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton:  I don't. I like being able to concentrate on what I'm doing one thing at a time, you know. And I think if I had one, I'm so hyper and always trying to do three things at once, I'd be worse than he is or worse than she is. So I don't have one.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: What's Chelsea going to be? Is she interested in government?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: Yes, she's interested in government. She cares about public health. She thinks that America has still got a ways to go to develop an affordable, high quality health care system. And I think she wants to be a part of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: Sarah Palin, net plus, net gain?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: I think she was a net plus before the failure of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the stock market, because she gave (McCain) credibility on the Republican right. Through no fault of her own, she became a negative on September 15th, because nobody on their team had any economic experience, and the burden against the Republicans was overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: What do you make of President Obama? I mean, for a while I know that you were down and dirty tough when Hillary was running. And that was a pretty rough campaign, a very close campaign. What do you make of him now?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: Well, I always had a great respect for his abilities. Those have been confirmed by the way he's conducted himself in the transition and in these early weeks. I think he is very smart. And I think he wants right things for America. And I think he's made good people decisions and good policy decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: Can he try to live like a normal person -- going home to Chicago, kids go to school, he helps take them to school, plays basketball, goes out to public restaurants? Can you keep that up?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: I think so.  I did quite a bit of it and I wish I had done even more.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: What would you recommend or say or advise George W. Bush about being a former president? There aren't many of you.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: Well, first I would advise him to make his own decisions with Laura about how they want to spend both the next five years and then the rest of his life. You have to assume he'll live 20 to 25 more years, and he seems to be in very good health. And I think he should just look at this as a whole new phase of his life.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: You opened the second Clinton Global Initiative University conference this past weekend and also a thousand students attended. How do you see the younger generation responding the global challenges, especially in these economic times?\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: There is a very large number of them who are doing astonishing things. For example, one young woman decided that she's going to go around and collect all the kitchen grease from all the dining halls and then nearby eateries and then use it to make biodiesels, to run cars and lawn mowers and generators.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing: For all the years we've known each other, it never gets dull.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton: Thank you.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The machine used by the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian in more than 100 assisted suicides will be among the items up for sale later this month, the auctioneer and his estate announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Michigan pathologist helped spur an international ethics debate by helping suffering patients die and pushing for this practice to be legalized. His conviction in one such case landed him in prison for eight years. He died in early June at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, at the age of 83.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe auction will take place between 6 and 8 p.m. on October 28 at the New York Institute of Technology, according to a press release sent on behalf of both the late doctor's estate and the auctioneer. More than 100 pieces will be part of the sale, said Roger Neal, who is representing the two parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the noted Thanatron machine, which Kevorkian built, other items to be auctioned include some of Kevorkian's correspondences and invention ideas, a pearl flute, his doctor's bag, a master lock from prison and his signature blue sweater. People can also purchase provocative paintings that he created, which come with brief descriptions from the artist himself, according to Neal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pieces are being kept under armed guard this week in Los Angeles, then will be shipped to New York. Neal said that the auction will be coordinated by David Streets, a Beverly Hills, California, fine art and celebrity memorabilia adviser, according to his website.\n\n\n\n\n\nA portion of the auction proceeds will go toward the charity Kids Kicking Cancer at the request of the attorney for Kevorkian's estate and the late doctor's niece and sole living heir, according to Neal.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevorkian, dubbed \"Dr. Death,\" made national headlines as a supporter of physician-assisted suicide and \"right-to-die\" legislation. He was charged with murder numerous times through the 1990s for helping terminally ill patients take their own lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 1999 stemming from the death of a patient who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease. He was paroled in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his release, he said he would not help end any more lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta last year, Kevorkian said he had no regrets about his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, no. It's your purpose (as a) physician. How can you regret helping a suffering patient?\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- He's been a homicidal singing barber in \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" and a drunken swashbuckler in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\"\n\n\n\nDepp is back as bank robber John Dillinger, revered in the Depression as a modern-day Robin Hood.\n\n\n\nNow, Hollywood shape-shifter Johnny Depp is back as another unexpectedly charismatic outlaw: Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, a character he says he's been drawn to since he was a boy.\n\n\n\n\"I sort of had a fascination with John Dillinger when I was about 10, 11 years old, for some reason,\" Depp told CNN. \"I always kind of admired him, oddly.\"\n\n\n\nOddly, perhaps, because for a short but intense period between September 1933 and July 1934 Dillinger and his gang rampaged through the American Midwest, staging jail breaks, robbing banks, and killing 10 men and wounding seven along the way.\n\n\n\nDillinger's violent spree is the focus of gangster drama \"Public Enemies,\" the latest offering from director Michael Mann, and also starring Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard.\n\n\n\nMann is known for his sympathetic portrayal of criminals, and Dillinger -- whose acts on the wrong side of the law led him to become one of America's first celebrities -- is the quintessential good hood.\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s, the United States was in the grips of the worst financial disaster in history -- a time when many Americans watched their life savings disappear and became jobless and hungry.\n\n\n\nMembers of the public blamed banks for losing their money and politicians for failing to stop them. For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood.\n\n\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public.\n\n\n\nThere is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women.\n\n\n\nHe was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies.\n\n\n\nIt is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies'\n\n\n\nOf course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements.\n\n\n\nThat was something that took courage, according to Mann: \"He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness.\"\n\n\n\nDepp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters. He shook off an early reputation as a teen pin-up in movies like Tim Burton's 1991 Gothic tale \"Edward Scissorhands.\"\n\n\n\nHe went on to cement his reputation for unusual film choices and quirky performances in films like \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005) and \"Finding Neverland\" (2004).  In pictures: Johnny Depp's iconic roles \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe 46-year-old actor says he felt a close affinity to Dillinger: \"I related to John Dillinger like he was a relative. I felt he was of the same blood. He reminded me of my stepdad and very much of my grandfather.\n\n\n\n\"He seemed to be one of those guys with absolutely no bull whatsoever, who lived at a time when a man was a man.\"\n\n\n\n\"Public Enemies\" was adapted by Mann from a nonfiction book of the same name by Bryan Burrough. Is it sozzled Captain. Jack Sparrow or smooth Donnie Brasco? Tell us your favorite Johnny Depp character in the SoundOff box below.\n\n\n\nThe \"Last of the Mohicans\" director is known for fastidious research and attention to detail, which in this case included collaborating closely with the FBI to check facts -- although Mann subsequently chose to gloss over some elements for the sake of the story.\n\n\n\nMann filmed in many of the locations where Dillinger's story took place almost 80 years ago, including the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, where the bandit was finally shot dead by FBI agents as he came out of a Clark Gable movie.\n\n\n\nThey also shot at Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters in the far north of Wisconsin, the site of one of Dillinger's most famous showdowns with the FBI.\n\n\n\nDillinger was hiding out there after a botched robbery. When the feds finally caught up with him, two men were killed in the vicious gunfight.\n\n\n\n\"We were able to shoot not just in the actual place where this happened, but in his actual room,\" says Mann.\n\n\n\n\"There's a certain kind of magic for Johnny Depp to be lying in the bed that John Dillinger was actually in.\"\n\n\n\nA lot of Dillinger's success was down to superior guns and getaway cars. Depp, who has experience shooting guns from previous productions, had to learn a completely different technique for the heavy guns of the time.\n\n\n\nDepp says shooting the Thompson submachine gun was one of the highlights of the production: \"When you've got a beast like that strapped to you and you're emptying magazines, a 50-round drum, it's a good feeling.\"\n\n\n\nThe ride may have been thrilling for Depp but he also recognizes that the Depression-era setting has some extra significance these tight-belted times.\n\n\n\n\"You know,\" says Depp, \"We're in the middle of a recession, teetering on a depression. It's time to view the banks and grown-ups for what they are.\"",

  "context": "(Travel + Leisure) -- Boston-based wedding planner Bernadette Smith has helped arrange the same-sex nuptials of nearly 75 Massachusetts couples during her five-year career. But she's never seen quite the surge in business as she has during the past few months.\n\n\n\nWedding planners have seen a surge in same-sex couples traveling to New England to tie the knot.\n\n\n\nSmith's calendar first started filling up when the 1913 law that banned gay marriage for out-of-state couples was lifted in July 2008. But, she says, things became even more hectic when Proposition 8, the California ballot proposal restricting marriage to heterosexual couples, passed in the November elections.\n\n\n\nNow Smith and other wedding planners have seen a surge in gays and lesbians traveling to New England to tie the knot. And the trend is growing quickly: On April 3, Iowa's Supreme Court found its gay-marriage ban unconstitutional; four days later, the Vermont legislature gave same-sex couples the right to marry; and on April 16, New York Governor David Paterson announced he would introduce a bill to legalize gay marriage.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, hotels and resorts that cater to same-sex weddings are cashing in. One is the Hob Knob in Martha's Vineyard; its Escape & Elope package includes an intimate ceremony, along with Champagne and massages. And all their wedding packages come with access to Tulle, a destination wedding-and-gown specialist that can accommodate not just one picky bride, but two.\n\n\n\nAnother property capitalizing on the ruling is the Mayflower Inn & Spa in Washington, Connecticut. The inn's \"At Last\" package includes all the traditional trimmings of a wedding: rehearsal dinner, couples' massage, garden ceremony, and officiant, along with either \"his and his\" or \"hers and hers\" stylists. The hotel also offers 25 percent off room rates on the couples' wedding anniversary for life -- much better than a Tupperware set. Travel + Leisure: 50 best romantic getaways\n\n\n\nFor those who want to plan their own ceremony, Bernadette Smith suggests the Exchange Conference Center overlooking Boston Harbor -- it's where she'll be saying \"I do\" this summer.\n\n\n\nAnne P. Worcester, chief marketing officer of Market New Haven, a tourism and commerce organization for the New Haven area, suggests a few other same-sex-friendly Connecticut venues. There's the New Haven Lawn Club, known for its large ballroom and experience in gay weddings; the Union League Caf\u00e9 (\"arguably the best restaurant in all of New Haven,\" she says); and the quintessentially romantic carousel at Lighthouse Point.\n\n\n\nFor those traveling long distances, the Omni New Haven Hotel can accommodate out-of-town couples and their guests with in-house ballrooms, restaurants and a spa. Travel + Leisure: Great romantic weekend getaways\n\n\n\nAnne Stanback, executive director of Love Makes a Family (a pro-gay marriage organization in New Haven, Connecticut) has become an expert on same-sex wedding planning since she arranged her own nuptials without the help of bridal magazines.\n\n\n\n\"We may not see the lesbian version of Modern Bride until a few more states legalize marriage for same-sex couples, but I have no doubt we eventually will,\" she says.\n\n\n\nNow gay advocates in Iowa would like to create the same kind of wedding infrastructure available in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. Greg Nooney, who started one of the state's few gay-wedding Web sites, began receiving inquiries just days after the decision was finalized on April 3.\n\n\n\nNooney admits that building a roster of gay-friendly vendors won't happen overnight. \"It is taking some people a little time to get their bearings,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOne place that wasted no time in promoting itself as gay-friendly is the Sioux City Holiday Inn. Manager Larry Jenson says the property has held commitment ceremonies in the past and looks forward to hosting same-sex couples in the future.\n\n\n\nDespite the fast pace of change across America, however, wedding experts say all the feedback has been positive.\n\n\n\n\"People may be surprised at just how few ripples the change in the marriage law has caused here,\" says Anne Stanback, of Connecticut. \"There has been no backlash, there have been no protests. Just lots and lots of people who are pleased.\"\n\n\n\nPlanning a beach getaway? Don't miss Travel + Leisure's guide to Affordable Beach Resorts.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The vast sums of money made by football's middle men continues to soar, with English Premier League clubs this week detailing huge amounts paid to agents for helping to seal multi-million-dollar deals during the last 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nBig-spending table-toppers Manchester City predictably had the highest outlay, paying agents to the tune of $15.2 million between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011 for aiding the transfer of players such as Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately behind City were Tottenham Hotspur ($12 million) and Liverpool ($11 million).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese figures beg the question, what do England's biggest clubs gain from the use of agents and why are the payments made to them so large? The total \u00c2\u00a371.87 million ($112.8 million) spent in that period is a rise of almost $7.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very hard to know, to be honest -- clubs need to give us some answers,\" World Soccer Magazine editor Gavin Hamilton told CNN. \"There's no reason that they should be that high, because most of those clubs have very good scouting networks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine primed for Euro 2012 kick-off\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton believes that with clubs now possessing wide-ranging global scouting networks, the need to pay such large sums to agents should be lessened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They discover and scout players themselves, and the clubs that aren't scouting players are relying on agents. They don't need to be doing that. They've got their own scouting network,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith agents primarily employed to negotiate deals on behalf of players with their respective clubs, Hamilton argues it is the footballers themselves who should foot the bill for their services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the player that hires the agent to secure them a transfer, a new contract, so the players really should be paying the fees,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a big surprise to me that clubs continue to cover agents' fees, rather than insist the players, who are so well paid, reward their agents for the work they've done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the spending on agents could be considered as an unnecessary expense, Hamilton praised England's top division for showing the sort of transparency lacking in other top European leagues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a positive that the Premier League actually publishes the information,\" he explained. \"The Premier League has to be applauded for publishing the figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a good thing that they're published, it's a bad thing that they're so high.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton also outlined the danger of having agents who represent managers and players employed by the same club, such as when manager Mark Hughes and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez were both at Manchester City while being represented by Israeli Kia Joorabchian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think certain clubs rely on particular agents who are not just representing players, but also representing managers,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Managers now have agents. The Sunderland appointment, replacing Steve Bruce, there are a number of managers in the frame for the job who are with agents who also have high-profile players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a clear conflict of interest there and clubs tend to rely on managers who share an agent with players, and I think that is a dangerous situation to get into.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton wants stronger regulations placed upon agents, and hopes that financial fair-play regulations set to be introduced by European football's governing body UEFA will help improve the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new rules are aimed at preventing clubs across Europe spending beyond their means in pursuit of on-field success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the nature of the modern game at the moment, it's unregulated and the money is going out of the game into the bank accounts of agents,\" Hamilton said. \"I think over the next few years we are going to see more regulation with UEFA's financial fair play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What they're trying to do with financial fair play is have a system in place where clubs regulate their own spending, and clubs are aware that they can't just be throwing money at players and wages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think UEFA are moving in the right direction, but it's the clubs who have got take up the initiative. There will always be agents around trying to take money out of the game.\"",

Suspicious medics alerted police, who opened an investigation.\n\n\n\nDetectives began investigating the case after hospital officials started inquiring about the girl's family history.\n\n\n\nKerstin and two of her brothers, aged 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight, a television their only contact with the outside world.\n\n\n\nAnother three children Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife, who says she had no idea that her daughter was being held captive. A seventh child died shortly after birth.\n\n\n\nElisabeth and her children have been treated at a secure medical unit since their release.\n\n\n\nOfficials at hospital in Amstetten, Austria, did not release any more information about Kerstin Fritzl's condition.

I can only advise people not to get hit by him. I expected a tough fight and that is what it was. Holyfield is a great fighter and he proved it tonight.\"\n\nWith Valuev controlling the centre of the ring in the opening rounds, Holyfield danced around his opponent, hitting with occasional single shots.\n\nHe did well to stay away from Valuev\u00b4s long left jab and hit him with a big left in the fourth, but the Russian answered with a strong right uppercut.\n\nMuch to the delight of the crowd, the fifth was a good round for Holyfield who first landed a right-left combination to the body and later connected with a big left hook to the head.\n\nBoth men were on target during a mid-round exchange in the sixth, but Valuev\u00b4s left jab looked more effective. In the seventh, the crowd raised the roof when Holyfield fired in a combination to the head.\n\nValuev\u00b4s corner urged him to be more aggressive and he eventually landed a strong right in the eighth when Holyfield seemed to tire a little.\n\nThe seven foot Russian remained on the front foot as there was a big exchange during the ninth, and in the 10th Holyfield landed a strong right-left combination. Valuev finished better and pushed his opponent in the corner in the 12th .\n\nAfter the final bell, both men hugged each other, with either fighter claiming the win. When the scorecards were read, boos rang out as the crowd favorite's narrow defeat was confirmed.",

Apparently, so did the Giants offense. Congrats to the Giants from a Cowboys fan,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDavid Marks, of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, said it was \"one of the best football games I'd ever seen,\" but said watching the game with his family had some drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\"I was not able to enjoy the commercials as much because my mom wouldn't stop yakking away,\" he said. \"She's 80 years old and I didn't want to say anything at first -- you don't know how much longer you have your mom at that age. But finally after a quarter and a half, I had to ask her to pipe down.\"  Watch some of the pre-game festivities \u00bb\n\n\n\nDan Nash, of Santa Monica, California, didn't have that problem.\n\n\n\n\"It would be nice to see the GAME a little more,\" he said adding that \"every 10 seconds (or less), we're watching ads! Kickoff ... three ads. Punt ... three ads. Flag on the play ... two ads.\"\n\n\n\nHere is a sampling of our readers' reaction to the game:\n\n\n\nRussell Giuliano of Middletown, New Jersey I have seen every Super Bowl, and this was the best ever, even better than No. 3 with Namath.\n\n\n\nDave Viscusi of Schenectady, New York That was one of the best Super Bowls/Super Bowl parties I have ever been to. We made 4 different kinds of pizza (BBQ chicken, cheese, sausage and peppers), boneless buffalo wings, BBQ ribs, chips of all kinds, apple martinis, some beer and topped off the Giants victory with some CHAMPAGNE! GO G-Men ... Eli deserves every ounce of credit he gets for this Super Bowl ... Way to throw it right in the arrogant Patriots' face!\n\n\n\nRicardo Gomez of Buenos Aires, Argentina I'm a big Pats fan, and I was sad to see that last play when Manning escapes the Pats' defense and throw that pass, the one that put the GIANTS OFFENSE so close to the touchdown. Anyway, I think Pats are still the best team in the league, and I was there that snowy night when Brady got us to the Super Bowl at the last second with (Adam Vinatieri kicking) that amazing field goal! So GO PATS! GO!!!\n\n\n\nIrving Horowitz of Princeton, New Jersey There are three sport moments in my life that I will take to my grave with a broad grin and deep pleasure: The first was the Bobby Thompson home run for the New York (Baseball) Giants in 1951 to defeat the Dodgers; a varsity game while I was at Hobart & William Smith when, as a member of the faculty and staff, we defeated a first-class varsity team in 1962 and I made the winning basket with 28 seconds on the clock (I have the press clippings to prove this); and the biggest thrill of them all: Watching the New York (Football) Giants win Super Bowl XLII against the New England Patriots.\n\n\n\nWhen Bob Tisch spoke of \"this win is for all Giant fans who, for the past 30 years, supported the team at Giants Stadium, and before that at the Yankee Stadium, and for those who still remember being part of the Giants at the Polo Grounds,\" I felt that he spoke directly to me.\n\n\n\nAfter all, I am actually about a year or two older than the franchise ... Wow! 2008 is already a good year -- a good omen for America.\n\n\n\nMonique Mondesire of Bronx, New York I'm a 26-year-old female who really doesn't put much thought into sports, but that was the best Super Bowl game I have ever seen in my life. I had faith that it would happen, but the way it happened was priceless. I'm very proud to be a New Yorker and a new Giants fan. To all the New Yorkers that lost their bets yesterday, in the words of Don Corleone, \"Never go against the family.\"\n\n\n\nLisa Ciacci of Brooklyn, New York As a die-hard Cowboys fan, I may have been the most unlikely N.Y. Giants fan last night. I could not be happier for this team. They played their hearts out in quite possibly the best game I have ever watched. Eli Manning came of age before our very eyes and proves once again that he is truly a class act. I hope this loss haunts the Patriots forever. They weren't good enough to beat the Giants last night nor will they ever be. This city will surely explode at tomorrow's parade -- it's good to be in New York! GO GIANTS! E-mail to a friend",

The next hearing is set for March 9.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 21-year-old Pakistani, Kasab was one of 10 men accused of participating in the coordinated sieges on buildings such as the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, Mumbai's historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian forces killed nine suspects. More than 160 people, including many foreigners, died during the three days of attacks that began November 26.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities said Kasab was trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after a terrorist attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nNikam said on Wednesday that the 50-page document describing the charges against Kasab also contains the names of 35 other suspects being sought in the crimes, many of whom are thought to be members of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prosecutor said his office hopes to finish the trial for Kasab in three to six months. He has been in police custody since November 28.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso charged Wednesday were two men accused of helping to plan the violence, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, according to the prosecutor.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Florida prosecutors on Thursday revealed a list of reasons they're seeking the death penalty against Casey Anthony, who is charged with killing her daughter, Caylee.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Florida, law, prosecutors need to raise only one of 15 possible aggravating factors to support their decision to seek the death penalty. Assistant State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton cited five circumstances, according to a document obtained by CNN affiliate WESH and other Orlando, Florida, media outlets.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn death penalty cases, jurors are asked to weigh aggravating circumstances that make a crime especially heinous against mitigating factors that favor mercy, such as a lack of prior offenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the legal reasons cited: Caylee's death occurred during aggravated child abuse, was especially \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" and was committed in a \"cold, calculated and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification,\" according to the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaylee was also under 12 years old, and Anthony \"stood in a position of familial or custodial authority over her,\" the document states.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Levey, the court public information officer, could not confirm that Judge Belvin Perry Jr. received a copy of the notice. As of Thursday evening, defense attorney Jose Baez said he had not been served with the notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a hearing this week, Perry ordered the State Attorney's Office to disclose the aggravating factors they intend to cite in a penalty phase if Anthony is convicted of premeditated murder.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony, 24, is accused of killing 2-year-old Caylee, who disappeared in June 2008. Her body was found that December in a vacant lot near her grandparents' home in Orlando.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense lawyers have said that prosecutors are seeking the death penalty to bankrupt the defense and prevent Anthony from having the attorney of her choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defense said that prosecutors had originally said they would not seek death in the case but reversed that position in March 2009 when they learned that Anthony had $205,000 for her defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the money came from ABC News for the licensing of photos and videos, Baez testified during a previous hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony's trial is scheduled to begin May 9, 2011.",

Those wounded were offered between $20,000 and $50,000 apiece, Salman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackwater guards protecting a U.S. State Department convoy opened fire in Nusoor Square, in western Baghdad, in October 2007, killing 17 people and wounding more than two dozen.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackwater denied any wrongdoing, arguing its contractors used necessary force to protect a State Department convoy that had come under fire from insurgents.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq called the killings unprovoked and an act of \"premeditated murder.\" The incident led the Iraqi government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Xe and other firms operating in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nXe announced it was settling the lawsuit last week to allow the company, which is also under new management, to move ahead \"free of the costs and distraction of ongoing litigation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the guards who took part in the shooting pleaded guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge in a U.S. court 2008.

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is blocking public release of photos apparently depicting abuse of suspected terrorists and foreign troops in U.S. custody, and urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a lower court ruling ordering the photos to be publicly disclosed, according to court documents.\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates notified the high court late Friday that he was issuing an order to block the release.\n\n\n\nThe photos have been at the center of a years-long lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. Congress last month gave the Obama administration specific authority to prevent any release of the 44 photos. Afterward, Gates signed a certificate of authorization, or order, to prevent the photos' release, saying their disclosure would endanger U.S. troops serving abroad.\n\n\n\nThe order covers all photographs taken of people captured or detained in overseas military operations between September 11, 2001, the day of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and January 22, 2009, shortly after President Obama took office.\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon initially was set to release the images of Iraqi and Afghan prisoners in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU.\n\n\n\nBut Obama and the Justice Department objected to the court-ordered release, reversing an earlier executive decision. Obama had initially agreed to the release, but changed his mind after military leaders privately and intensely urged him to block it.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU criticized the administration's about-face, saying it \"makes a mockery\" of Obama's campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability, and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners.\n\n\n\nA homeland security appropriations bill passed October 29 by Congress and signed by the president grants the Department of Defense authority to withhold the photographs.\n\n\n\nThe images were gathered as part of a military investigation into allegations that detainees held in Afghanistan and Iraq were tortured and physically abused.\n\n\n\nAccording to the government legal brief filed with the high court, several of the photos show \"soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees.\" Other images described by military reports show prisoners in restrained and humiliating positions. Military investigations led to criminal charges against some of the soldiers shown in the images.\n\n\n\nThe photos currently at issue are separate from those first publicly released in 2006 showing abuse of Muslim men held at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison.\n\n\n\nThe New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 2008 that the photos must be released. The president later said that doing so \"would pose an unacceptable risk of danger to U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.\"\n\n\n\nNewest Justice Sonia Sotomayor had served on that appeals court until August, but was not involved in that particular case.\n\n\n\nThe high court has delayed for weeks a decision on whether it would accept the ACLU appeal on the broader issues associated with government authority to block release of potentially embarrassing and inflammatory material by the military. The justices will now probably wait to hear from the ACLU over Gates' order before deciding whether to take the case.\n\n\n\nThe Senate in May voted for the Detainee Photographic Records Protection Act, which would limit the reach of the Freedom of Information Act request in this instance. The House adopted a similar provision in October.\n\n\n\nOther photos could be released under the earlier appeals court ruling. The case is Department of Defense v. ACLU (09-160).\n\n\n\nSeparately, the administration also urged the high court to dismiss a pending lawsuit by several Guantanamo Bay detainees, over their claims of torture and religious discrimination.\n\n\n\nA brief was filed by the Justice Department late Friday, the same time as the separate photograph disclosure case.\n\n\n\nFour British men, all Muslims and former detainees at the military prison at the Navy base in Cuba, had sued onetime Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials, saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law.\n\n\n\nA federal appeals court had dismissed the lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims.\n\n\n\nBut in June 2008, the Supreme Court allowed Guantanamo prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court, and the justices in December urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the British detainees.\n\n\n\nIn the government filing, Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called \"new rights\" to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting. The high court, she noted, had previously told lower courts \"to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.\"\n\n\n\nThe case is Rasul v. Myers (09-227).",

  "context": "Editor's note: CNN's Ed Henry traveled with Barack Obama to Europe on the his first overseas trip as president.\n\nPresident Obama speaks during a news conference after the G-20 summit in London, England, on April 2.\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- One of the most revealing moments of President Obama's European tour came early in the trip at the close of the G-20 summit in London, England, where expectations were sky high for the new guy.\n\nHe had just scored some victories on the financial crisis, while also taking some lumps. And now he had to face the media.\n\nPushed by a reporter on why he couldn't get more done, the president was ready with a comeback about how it was far easier for American and British leaders to get their way at summits in years gone by.\n\n\"Well, if there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's a -- that's an easier negotiation,\" the president said to laughter from reporters. \"But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in.\"\n\nIn two simple sentences, the president accomplished a lot.\n\nIn the first sentence, he made a fair point about how no U.S. president -- Barack Obama or George W. Bush -- can simply wave a magic wand and get the world to follow his lead.\n\nAnd in the second, with the line about how \"it shouldn't be the world that we live in,\" he was trying to send a signal to Europe that he's not planning to bully them.\n\nAgain and again, Obama said he was here to listen and learn -- not to lecture colleagues such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Left unsaid, since it was plain enough to see, was what Obama was really saying: I'm not President Bush.\n\nThat was clearly Obama's biggest accomplishment on this trip. He was able to effectively press that reset button administration officials have been talking about in order to make the case that traditional U.S. allies should come back into the fold, and it seemed to work.\n\nI remember sitting in the front row during a news conference at a palace in France to hear Sarkozy positively gush, \"And it feels really good to be able to work with a U.S. president who wants to change the world and who understands that the world does not boil down to simply American frontiers and borders. And that is a hell of a good piece of news for 2009.\"\n\nThose are the style points where Obama clearly scored, and not just with European leaders.\n\nA new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 79 percent of Americans surveyed feel that Obama has had a \"more positive\" effect on how people in other countries view the U.S. Only 19 percent of those surveyed thought he's had a \"more negative\" effect.\n\nThe much tougher question is on substance, and whether Obama was able to capitalize on those warm feelings to accomplish what he set out to do before this trip. On that he basically has an incomplete because the early record here in Europe has been mixed.\n\nAt the London summit, the president pushed for big money to be pumped into the world economy, and the leaders responded with $1.1 trillion. But that money is being directed to the International Monetary Fund to help developing countries, not pumped into the large economies to stimulate growth as U.S. officials had hoped.\n\nAnd Obama was also able to help prevent Sarkozy and others from getting a global supercop to oversee markets across all borders, a bit of a victory in his effort to make sure new regulations do not go too far.\n\nPerhaps the biggest victory came on the sidelines of the G-20 and had nothing to do with the financial crisis.\n\nObama had his first face-to-face with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and they seemed to thaw those recently icy relations. Most important, is the two men agreed to begin intense negotiations to drastically reduce each side's nuclear stockpiles. This could be a dramatic step forward for world peace, so pay close attention to this development.\n\nBut a cautionary note: There's a lot of heavy lifting left before this becomes a reality, and we may not know until Obama's visit to Moscow in July whether or not this deal has legs.\n\nAt the NATO summit in France and Germany, the president was hoping to get a boost in resources for the war in Afghanistan. He did get allies to cough up about 5,000 troops, but in the form of police and security trainers -- not combat troops. So with Obama already committing 21,000 more U.S. troops to the mission, this is a very U.S.-heavy effort, something to keep a close eye on in the days ahead.\n\nIn Prague, Czech Republic, at the European Union summit, Obama delivered a speech about nuclear nonproliferation to more than 20,000 people -- a boisterous crowd reminiscent of the campaign. He even used the old line \"yes we can\" to answer critics who think he can't follow through on ridding the world of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut the most important moment of that stop in the tour came a few hours before the speech.\n\nIt was when the infamous 3 a.m. phone call that Hillary Clinton talked about in the campaign finally arrived. Except it came at 4:30 a.m., when spokesman Robert Gibbs woke the president with the news that North Korea had tested a missile.\n\nHe basically passed the test of his first international crisis (with -- ahem -- Secretary of State Clinton at his side, no less), although so far the administration has gotten nowhere at the United Nations despite a clear case against North Korea.\n\nWelcome to the U.N., sir.\n\nAnd finally, in Turkey the president officially began his outreach to try and repair the U.S. image in the Muslim world. Most interesting is that he got personal, alluding to the fact that he grew up in Indonesia and his father was Muslim -- politically risky given that last year he spent so much time having to deny false rumors that he's Muslim.\n\n\"The United States has been enriched by Muslim-Americans,\" Obama said. \"Many other Americans have Muslims in their family, or have lived in a Muslim-majority country -- I know, because I am one of them.\"\n\nThe speech was very well-received in this Muslim-majority nation. But it will take far more than one speech to fix tensions flared by everything from the war to Iraq to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nIn all, that's a hefty agenda to confront in just eight days abroad. It's no surprise then that I've noticed the president has been looking very tired on this trip. One aide told me that Obama was planning to go out for a nice unofficial dinner with first lady Michelle Obama in Prague on Saturday night but it was canceled because they simply needed some sleep.\n\nThe fatigue has been complicated by the fact that Obama has been battling a nasty cold, telling aides he feels like he's got an \"acorn up my nose\" -- an interesting turn of phrase I had never heard before but seems to mean the president is stuffed up.\n\nAnd that brings me back to that brandy Roosevelt and Churchill shared decades ago.\n\nObama made a legitimate claim about the difficulty of calling the shots in the current global environment, where small and mid-sized countries hold more sway than before.\n\nBut right now all I can focus on is the brandy itself. After eight long days on the road, and very little sleep, I'm pretty ragged, too. That sounds like a pretty good way to cap things off.",

Others suffered injuries as a result of being severely beaten, Amnesty said Wednesday as it called on authorities to \"put an immediate stop to the witch-hunting campaign.\"\n\n\n\nAmnesty claimed Gambian President Yahya Jammeh had invited \"witch doctors\" -- believed to be from neighboring Guinea -- to the West African nation  following the death of his aunt.\n\n\n\nJammeh, a former soldier who has ruled Gambia since leading a military coup in 1994, is reported to believe that witchcraft was involved in her death, according to Amnesty.\n\n\n\nCNN contacted State House, the presidential residence in the Gambian capital, Banjul, but no-one was available to comment. \"I have no information,\" a woman told CNN.\n\n\n\nVictims and their relatives tell Amnesty that \"witch doctors\" accompanied by police, soldiers and security forces have been visiting villages and seizing people accused of being witches by force and at gunpoint.\n\n\n\nMembers of Jammeh's personal guard, known as \"green boys,\" are also alleged to have taken part in the campaign.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent incident on March 9, 300 people from the village of Sintet were forced to go to a farm owned by Jammehk, Amnesty said.\n\n\n\nOne of those seized said he had been held for five days and forced to drink \"dirty water\" containing poisonous herbs which caused instant diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\n\n\n\"I experienced and witnessed such abuse and humiliation.

It is from the dark ages,\" the victim told Amnesty.\n\n\n\nHundreds of Gambians have also fled to neighboring Senegal following attacks on their villages, according to Amnesty.\n\n\n\nIt also said it was concerned that a prominent opposition lawmaker, Halifa Sallah, who was arrested earlier this month after investigating the witchcraft claims for a newspaper, could be at risk of being tortured while in custody.\n\n\n\nHalifa, a former presidential candidate, heads the People's Democratic Organization of Independence and Socialism and is minority leader in Gambia's national assembly.",

I hijacked an airplane,\" said Potts, who was convicted of air piracy.\n\nPotts says he was enthused by Fidel Castro and his revolution.

  "context": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- For the first time in U.S. history, the largest single group of poor children in any racial or ethnic category is Hispanic, according to a new survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling it \"a negative milestone\" in Hispanics' explosive growth in the United States, the Pew Hispanic Center study said in 2010, 37.3% of poor children in the U.S. were Hispanic, compared with 30.5% white and 26.6% black.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pew analysis of new census data put the number of Hispanic children in poverty at 6.1 million in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis negative trend has emerged as the 2010 census confirmed for the first time that Hispanics are the nation's No. 2 group, surpassing African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nHispanics now make up 16.3% of the total American population -- but in the youth demographic, Hispanic kids comprise an even bigger share -- 23.1% of U.S. children are Latino, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how Hispanics drove the growth of the white population\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found there are 6.1 million Latino children living in poverty, and more than two-thirds of them -- 4.1 million -- are children of immigrant parents. Of those 4.1 million, 86% were born in America, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining 2 million poor Latino children have U.S.-born parents, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the recession, more white children lived in poverty than Latino kids, but since the recession began in 2007, those positions reversed, and the number of poor Hispanic children grew by 36.3% between 2007 and 2010, or 1.6 million, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of white and black children in poverty also grew, but not as big, the study found.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how the white population changed in relation to minorities\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recession hit Latino families hard: the unemployment rate among Hispanic workers is 11.1%, compared with a national rate of 9.1%, and the household wealth for Latinos fell more sharply than for white or black families between 2005 and 2009, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood insecurity also grew among Latinos, with one-third of households facing the problem in 2008, up from 23.8% the prior year, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaders of programs serving the poor said Thursday their experiences match the study's findings, which was released Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his twice-a-month acts of charity, Reverend Carlos Paiva has noticed the increasing number of Latino youngsters who arrive with their families at his Angelica Lutheran Church near downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe church gives free rice, beans, potatoes, onions and fruits to needy families, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The numbers are growing,\" Paiva said about Latino kids who show up at the church with their families. \"The average age of the people who come here for food is 10 years old.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Flood, CEO of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, said his group's recent summer lunch program for poor children saw \"a lot more kids from the Latino community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It worries us,\" Flood said. \"Given the fact that the economy hasn't turned around, it's a more desperate deal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Martinez, director of programming at Bienestar, a nonprofit that runs nine health community centers in southern California for Latinos, said he was \"sad and disappointed to see that my community is facing these problems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Especially for the more recent immigrants, they have more limited resources to work. We have more requests to go to the food bank and housing,\" Martinez said.",

  "context": "PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Basketball great Charles Barkley began serving a three-day sentence in Arizona's infamous Tent City on Saturday, jailed by the same sheriff whose autobiography he endorsed 12 years ago.\n\nCharles Barkley bristled at the implication he should be wearing stripes instead of a red-and-bue sweatsuit.\n\n\"You come here when you screw up,\" Barkley said at a news conference hours after he reported at the Maricopa County jail. \"I don't blame anybody for this situation but myself.\"\n\nBarkley, 45, pleaded guilty last month to misdemeanor drunken-driving charges stemming from a New Year's Eve arrest after he left a Scottsdale, Arizona, nightclub.\n\nA judge sentenced him to 10 days in jail, but his sentence was reduced in exchange for Barkley's attending an alcohol-awareness course.\n\nAt the news conference, Barkley sat next to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed \"Toughest Sheriff in America.\" Arpaio is known for giving inmates old-fashioned, black-and-white-striped uniforms, making some of them live in tents and reinstituting chain gangs, even for women.\n\n\"I'm an equal incarcerator,\" Arpaio said of Barkley, who will be sleeping in one of the tents. \"We don't discriminate.\"\n\nHe said Barkley has been \"a gentleman, cordial.\"\n\n\"He's taking his medicine,\" Arpaio said. \"I hope that something comes out of this.\"\n\nIn a free-wheeling news conference, Barkley spoke out against drunken driving, made some observations about President Obama (\"Rush Limbaugh and a lot of jackasses are giving him a hard time right now\") and commented on felony charges singer Chris Brown faces for allegedly beating his girlfriend, singer Rhianna.  Watch Barkley speak at news conference \u00bb\n\n\"I wish both of them the best, but it's never acceptable to hit a woman. Period,\" Barkley said.\n\nBarkley wore a red-and-blue sweatsuit, not the black-and-white stripes that other inmates -- who watched the news conference through a chain-link fence --were wearing. Barkley said it's because he's on the jail's work-release program, and bristled at questions about it.\n\n\"None of the work-release people do that,\" he said. \"But if y'all really, really want to put me as low as I can go, I can do that and make you feel better.\n\n\"I know when [someone is] famous, you like to see people humiliated.\"\n\nArpaio, who joked with Barkley over the pink underwear he routinely issues inmates, held up a copy of his 1996 book, \"America's Toughest Sheriff.\" On its back cover, alongside endorsements by Limbaugh, Arizona Sen. John McCain and others, is one from Barkley.\n\n\"This man, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, is a role model for all Americans,\" Barkley wrote in the blurb.\n\nBarkley is a basketball commentator for TNT, which like CNN is a Time Warner company. A star for the Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns, Barkley was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 1993 and inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2006.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- All the world's a stage, Shakespeare wrote long before television came into view.\n\n\n\nEveryone will be famous for 15 minutes, Andy Warhol added a few centuries later.\n\n\n\nWhich leads us inexorably to Michaele and Tareq Salahi's exuberant Facebook posting: \"Honored to be at the White House for the state dinner in honor of India with President Obama and our First Lady!\"\n\n\n\nThey have the pictures to prove it, and the overnight fame, too. The Salahis, with a Bravo camera crew in tow, apparently were trying to ratchet up their prospects for the cable network's upcoming \"The Real Housewives of D.C.\"\n\n\n\nIf only the Salahis were the exception. But the modern-day reality show genre, spearheaded nearly a decade ago by the first edition of CBS' \"Survivor,\" has become a tidal wave of cost-efficient TV programming starring ... pretty much anyone. Its inhabitants increasingly are called on to step up the pace in pursuit of myriad available slots on networks large, small and sometimes desperate. Stand out in a crowd, or be pushed aside by someone who will.\n\n\n\nCrashing a White House state dinner has proved to be just the ticket for the fame-craving Salahis. Their audacious breach of Secret Service security has trumped the reality show aspirations of the \"balloon boy\" family and possibly even knocked Jon Gosselin out of the \"Entertainment Tonight\" spotlight for a day or two. Imagine that.\n\n\n\nWhat does this say about us as a people? Well, the quest for fame is hardly new. Nor is our collective fascination with train wrecks. What's changed is the escalation in available venues. There's seemingly no limit to the number of enablers out there. Hitting it big with a \"reality\" franchise can work wonders for a TV network's bottom line, overall visibility -- or both.\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, TLC was The Learning Channel. You actually could learn something by watching its instructional and educational programming. But the network gradually got out of that business. And it hit the mother lode with \"Jon & Kate Plus 8,\" which eventually became the public face of a broken marriage while making the Gosselins internationally famous.\n\n\n\nBravo, home to the ever-expanding \"Real Housewives\" franchise, used to devote itself to the performing arts. That began to change in a hurry after NBC Universal took control of the network in 2002. The network now offers a virtual wall-to-wall reality lineup, with only occasional intrusions from \"Inside the Actors Studio,\" the only remaining evidence of what Bravo used to be.\n\n\n\nA&E originally launched as the Arts & Entertainment Network. Believe it or not, it once housed an anthology series, \"A&E Stage,\" that brought its audience plays, concerts, documentaries and even opera. The reality bug long since has bitten hard, though, with the once high-minded cable outlet now best known for \"Dog the Bounty Hunter, Intervention\" and \"Criss Angel Mindfreak.\"\n\n\n\nMTV used to be nothing but music videos. \"The Real World\" changed everything. NBC had a long and well-earned reputation for Emmy-caliber comedies and dramas such as \"Seinfeld,\" \"The Cosby Show,\" \"Frasier,\" \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"ER\" and \"L.A. Law.\" Now its most popular attraction, other than \"Sunday Night Football,\" is a weekly two-hour dose of \"The Biggest Loser,\" where little other than size matters.\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Salahis in a way are only acting naturally. That's lamentable, a sad commentary, an appalling sign of our times, etc., etc. But TV has created -- and continues to create -- a bottomless pit of venues where preeners are prized commodities and abnormal behavior is not only encouraged but intrinsic to the common goal.\n\n\n\nThe lone exception these days appears to be major league baseball. When a goofball fan runs out onto the field, the cameras turn away so as not to reward the trespasser with a minute or two of national or regional exposure.\n\n\n\nWhat a concept. Too bad it'll never catch on.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Bark.",

In an age of nonstop tabloid exhibitionism, she stands out as a beacon of confident allure.\n\n\n\nWithin a short period of time, the young actress has graduated from fashion ing\u00e9nue to a woman who navigates the designer realm with intrepid spirit and lashings of wit.\n\n\n\nNow that she has her bearings, Hathaway is ready to express her individuality.  Watch how Anne Hathaway changes her style \u00bb\n\n\n\nShe arrives for our meeting looking well scrubbed, bohemian and totally incognito: Her navy jacket is from Et Vous in Paris; the jeans, True Religion; the flats, Lanvin; and the bag, Anya Hindmarch.\n\n\n\nAn Yves Saint Laurent lapis lazuli ring and Ugandan handcrafted beads from Beadforlife.org are all the embellishment she needs.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that nowadays some stars confuse being stylish with dressing really slutty. What's your take?  I've always been on the conservative side when it comes to showing skin. I'm from that school where you show one part of your body, not all of it. So compared to the girls you're talking about, I'm quite prim... [But] sometimes you just make mistakes. I once wore a see-through dress to an event, but I had absolutely no idea ...  You didn't do the lighting test!   And I have never not done the lighting test after that. At the end of the day, you have to dress in what you're comfortable in. If you're at ease in a bikini top and a miniskirt -- though I certainly wouldn't be -- go for it.\n\n\n\nCan you talk about your style philosophy?\n\n\n\nIf you're going to be glamorous, it has to be tempered with eccentricity so that it incorporates your own personality. Dressing up is great, but you need a twist.\n\n\n\nAnd one of my biggest style influences has been Rachel Zoe, who introduced me to glamour. Now I'm kind of pushing her a little bit to explore the eccentric side. Lately, I've been having a lot more fun with how I dress. I am braving the idea of ending up on a worst-dressed list, but I'm also a lot happier with what I wear.\n\n\n\nWhat's the most tragic thing you wore in high school?\n\n\n\nSo many things! I was still recovering from Clueless when I was in high school, so probably one too many baby-doll skirts with baby Ts, knee socks, mary janes and barrettes. Maybe the occasional pair of flannel pajama pants during finals week. I don't let myself get that slobby these days.\n\n\n\nWhat does the word \"chic\" mean to you?\n\n\n\nI instantly think of Audrey Hepburn -- she could do no wrong. Her style was revolutionary. She was ladylike without being stuffy. And I also love Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett and Selma Blair, who is so fabulous.\n\n\n\nAny other Hollywood icons lurking in your closet?\n\n\n\nI'm currently having a Gwen Stefani moment. I just bought some beautiful shorts from her fashion line, LAMB.\n\n\n\nDo you enjoy the whole red-carpet circus?\n\n\n\nFor a while it was very new and very frightening, and I would just work myself up so in all my photos I looked like I was staring down the barrel of a gun. I don't beat myself up about it anymore.\n\n\n\nDid you care when the tabloids ragged on your white Valentino dress with the black bow at the 2007 Oscars?\n\n\n\nI consider it a good sign when you end up on best- and worst-dressed lists. If you're universally best, then you've been quite boring.\n\n\n\nLet's talk about \"Get Smart\": Is it retro, or did they update the groovy sixties vibe of Agent 99's look?\n\n\n\nIt's groovy in a different way. There are some things that are very mod, but we're not making Austin Powers 4 -- it's not a spoof. It's more like a comedic Bourne Identity.  Watch Hathaway, other stars talk about movie \u00bb\n\n\n\nI wore a few body-hugging dresses, which was so fun since I'm not used to them. I did inherit 99's Chanel bag addiction, and I was very happy about that. I have a ton of action sequences, and I had to be able to fight in every single outfit.\n\n\n\nBeyond swinging a Chanel handbag, did you do anything in particular to get into shape for this role?\n\n\n\nI started working out about three months before the film began. I wanted to be curvy and muscle-y. I took my body inspiration from Jessica Biel. I didn't quite get those results, but she's great.\n\n\n\nDavid Kirsch, my trainer, has made sure that I am no longer self-conscious about my thighs. Eventually my knees are going to be all wrinkly and I'm not going to be able to wear things like short skirts, so I take pleasure in wearing them now.\n\n\n\nNext you play a bridezilla opposite Kate Hudson in \"Bride Wars.\" Did you get to wear show-stopping bridal gowns?\n\n\n\nI really can't say too much, but there's a fantastic scene where we're both in our dresses and we do absolutely terrible things to each other.\n\n\n\nGet a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Off a desert highway, about 15 miles from her home in the southern tip of Nevada, the mystery of Maureen Fields' disappearance began with the discovery of her abandoned car.\n\n\n\nThe body of Maureen Fields, seen here in June 2005, hasn't been found since she went missing in 2006.\n\n\n\nInvestigators found the 41-year-old woman's 2004 green Hyundai just across the California border on February 16, 2006. It was one day after her husband, Paul Fields, said he last saw her.\n\n\n\nInvestigators say they discovered Fields' purse and wallet, the keys in the ignition and a fully reclined driver's seat.\n\n\n\nThere were slippers and eyeglasses beneath the gas pedal, religious pamphlets, a knotted pair of pantyhose as well as three bottles of prescription tranquilizers and pain killers.  Watch an update on the case \u00bb\n\n\n\nA small spot of her blood and vomit stained a blanket strewn across the ground beside the car. But Fields, who'd been working as a Wells Fargo bank teller in the small town of Pahrump, Nevada, has never been found.\n\n\n\n\"Just looking at the circumstances, it could appear staged\" by whoever was responsible for her disappearance, said Detective Dave Boruchowitz, an investigator with the Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff's Office.\n\n\n\nReported inconsistencies in her 60-year-old husband's story, police said, paired with the fact that the couple was described as having a stormy relationship, made Paul Fields the initial suspect.\n\n\n\nA lack of physical evidence, however, has made the case unprosecutable, said Detective Joe Close, also with the Nye County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\n\nPaul Fields, who runs an auto business out of the double-wide trailer he and his wife shared, maintains his innocence. He's speculated that she faked her death before running off with another man. A message left at his home was not returned.\n\n\n\nBut his attorney, Harold Kuehn, said, \"His contention is and my belief is that if she's truly dead, and the court says she is for civil purposes, then he didn't do it. ... What he told police is what he told me. Basically she left one day, never to be seen again.\"\n\n\n\nIn a new twist, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett says an unknown male's DNA was found on key items at the scene of the abandoned car.\n\n\n\n\"What we have to explore is the possibility of another suspect,\" Beckett said. \"We have to find out who this male was and whose DNA was found at the scene. It's a lot more complicated than one may think it is.\"\n\n\n\nThe prosecutor said he's sure a jury would have reasonable doubt if presented a case with this question mark looming.\n\n\n\n\"We have a duty to make sure we're doing the right thing,\" he said. \"There are too many unanswered questions at this time.\"\n\n\n\nMaureen Fields has been declared dead, and the search for her body, and her killer, continues.\n\n\n\nHer father, Jim Fitzgerald, has been doing some investigating of his own. The former detective with the Newark, New Jersey, Police Department -- and now a national director with the conservative John Birch Society -- has made repeated trips from his Randolph Township, New Jersey, home to speak with his daughter's former friends and co-workers. He's also consulted with a psychic in his search for clues.\n\n\n\nNo matter when her body is found, a serial numbered metal jaw implant -- which served to combat Fields' teeth grinding habit -- will stand as proof of her identity, Fitzgerald said.\n\n\n\nSince murder carries no statute of limitations, time is on the law's side.\n\n\n\n\"The case isn't dead to us,\" said Boruchowitz, one of the detectives still on the investigation. \"We're going to continue to work it until we prove who did it.\"\n\n\n\nAnyone with information about this case should call the Nye County Sheriff's Office at 775-751-7000.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Dr. George Tiller, whose Kansas women's clinic frequently took center stage in the U.S. debate over abortion, was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita church Sunday morning, police said.\n\n\n\nDr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians that performed late-term abortions.\n\n\n\nWichita police said a 51-year-old man from the Kansas City, Kansas, area was in custody in connection with the slaying of Tiller, who was one of the few U.S. physicians who still performed late-term abortions.\n\n\n\nThe killing, which came about 16 years after Tiller survived a shooting outside his Wichita clinic, took place shortly after 10 a.m. Sunday at Reformation Lutheran Church. Officers found the 67-year-old dead in the foyer, police said.\n\n\n\nWitnesses provided a description of the car and a license number of the killer's getaway vehicle, Wichita police spokesman Gordon Bassham said. Police stopped a blue Ford Taurus matching the description about three hours later in Gardner, about 30 miles southwest of Kansas City, and took the driver into custody.\n\n\n\nNo charges had been filed Sunday evening and no motive for the killing was immediately known, but Wichita police Detective Tom Stoltz told reporters: \"We think we have the right person arrested.\"\n\n\n\n\"We will investigate this suspect to the Nth degree -- his history, his family, his associates -- and we are just in the beginning stages of that,\" Stoltz said.  See what people are saying about Dr. Tiller's murder \u00bb\n\n\n\nTiller's slaying drew condemnation from supporters, from some of those who tried to shut down his practice and from President Obama, who just two weeks ago urged Americans to seek \"common ground\" on the issue of abortion.\n\n\n\n\"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence,\" Obama said in a statement issued by the White House.\n\n\n\nThe shooting prompted U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to direct federal marshals to \"offer protection to other appropriate people and facilities around the nation,\" according to a statement from the Department of Justice.\n\n\n\nTiller had been practicing medicine for nearly 40 years, said Peter Brownlie, president of the Kansas City-based regional Planned Parenthood office. His patients were \"almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy,\" and where a woman's health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued, Brownlie said.\n\n\n\nHe and his staff had been picketed for years, with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood, Brownlie said. His clinic suffered serious damage from a bomb in the mid-1990s, and he was shot through both arms in 1993 by an anti-abortion activist who is currently serving time in federal prison.\n\n\n\n\"He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis,\" Brownlie said. \"As recently as early this month the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so.\"  Watch Tiller describe the philosophy of his clinic in 1999 \u00bb\n\n\n\nTiller had armed security at his clinic and a \"pretty rigorous\" security procedure at home, Brownlie said. But he \"made an effort to live his life as normally as possible knowing he could be a target at any time,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued through Tiller's lawyers, his family -- a wife, four children and 10 grandchildren -- said their loss \"is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America.\"\n\n\n\n\"George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence,\" his family said in a written statement. \"We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere.\"\n\n\n\nIn March, Tiller was acquitted of 19 counts of performing procedures unlawfully at his clinic. In 2008, a probe initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges.\n\n\n\nLeading anti-abortion groups condemned Sunday's shooting, emphasizing they wanted to shut down Tiller's practice by legal means.\n\n\n\nOperation Rescue, which has led numerous demonstrations at Tiller's clinic, called the shooting as a \"cowardly act.\" And the National Right to Life Committee, the largest U.S. anti-abortion group, said it \"unequivocally condemns any such acts of violence regardless of motivation.\"\n\n\n\n\"The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life,\" it said. \"The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal.\"\n\n\n\nBut Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who is no longer affiliated with the group, called Tiller \"a mass murderer.\"\n\n\n\n\"We grieve for him that he did not have time to properly prepare his soul to face God,\" Terry said in a written statement. \"I am more concerned that the Obama administration will use Tiller's killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions. Abortion is still murder, and we still must call abortion by its proper name.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Organization for Women, which supports abortion rights, called Tiller's killing an act of \"domestic terrorism.\" And NARAL Pro-Choice America said Tiller had worked for years under \"intense harassment tinged with persistent threats of violence.\"\n\n\n\nIf Tiller was killed because of his work, he would be the fourth U.S. physician killed over abortion since 1993. See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in his Amherst, New York, home. Anti-abortion activist James Kopp was later arrested in France and is serving life in prison.\n\n\n\nIn 1994, Dr. John Bayard Britton and one of his volunteer escorts were shot and killed outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. Paul Hill, a former minister, was convicted of the killings and executed in 2003.\n\n\n\nAnd in 1993, another doctor, David Gunn, was shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic. His killer, Michael Griffin, is serving a life sentence.\n\n\n\nIn addition, a nurse at a Birmingham, Alabama, clinic was maimed and an off-duty police officer was killed in a 1998 bombing by Eric Rudolph, who included abortion among his list of anti-government grievances.\n\n\n\nRudolph admitted to that attack and three other bombings -- including the 1996 attack on the Olympic games in Atlanta, Georgia -- and is currently serving life in prison.\n\n\n\nCNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Couples in the African kingdom of Swaziland are being urged to get tested together as part of a HIV \"love test\" campaign.\n\n\n\nA couple discusses the love test with a PSI member. Before the campaign, only 2 percent of couples got tested.\n\n\n\nThe nationwide initiative -- funded by the United States government and implemented by global charity 'Population Services International' (PSI) -- is aimed at couples because tests can be useless if partners are not aware of the others' HIV status.\n\n\n\n\"If partners get tested separately, they may not disclose the results and not get the support they need,\" Dominic McNeill, spokesman for PSI Swaziland, told CNN.\n\n\n\nOnly one in four people -- mostly female -- know their HIV status despite the fact that approximately 26 percent of the population in Swaziland is HIV positive.\n\n\n\nThe charity says it also wanted to move away from the traditional HIV campaigning methods.\n\n\n\n\"We wanted to turn HIV on its head and move away from the fear-inducing campaigns we've seen in the past, which don't work. Instead, we focus on love, saying that it is love that should be contagious and couples should get tested together,\" McNeill explained.\n\n\n\nWould you get tested with your partner? Tell us in the Soundoff below\n\n\n\nBut in a country where a macho culture still prevails, getting couples tested together has proved challenging.\n\n\n\nMcNeill said: \"In Swaziland it is difficult to convince men to get tested as it makes them feel inferior.\"\n\n\n\nPSI said it found that one of the most successful campaigning tools has been to directly target men in areas where they are often concentrated.\n\n\n\n\"We go to the places where men have their cattle disinfected and also work extensively in churches. We even have a testing facility in one of the countries' prisons\" said Iulian Circo, PSI's country director.\n\n\n\nWatch PSI in action in Swaziland\n\n\n\n\"Men are the head of the family and we try to get them to own up to that responsibility.\"\n\n\n\nPSI Swaziland received $3 million this year from the United States' President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) and has so far spent $35,000 on radio, TV and print advertisements.\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the campaign in April, PSI -- which partnered with UNICEF and UNAIDS -- told CNN it has already seen a 25 percent increase in couple testing and a 400 percent in general testing year-on-year.\n\n\n\nAnd neighboring countries such as Zambia, Mozambique and Namibia have already shown interest in the 'love test.'\n\n\n\nThe tests are also quick and free. Offered in facilities in the four regions of the country, they take only 45 minutes, including a 30-minute counseling session and on-the-spot results.\n\n\n\nIf results show one or both partners are HIV positive, PSI offers longer-term free counseling.\n\n\n\nThe HIV campaign is expected to last until the end of the year and the charity is also partnering with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- which has donated $50 million to fight aids in the region -- to promote male circumcision, medically proven to lower the risk of getting the HIV virus.",

With summer almost here, it's a totally different story for these kids, who according to their school are expected to read at or near grade level. \"It is an incredible thing for these students.\"\n\n\n\nGreer graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin. She arrived at PS 212, the multicultural magnet school in the Bronx, New York, two years ago with a degree in political science and a desire to change the world.\n\n\n\n\"When I found out about Teach For America,\" she said, \"I realized that teaching would be such an incredible way to make an impact.\"\n\n\n\nTeach For America is like a local Peace Corps serving some of the country's poorest public schools in inner cities and in rural areas. It has grown every year since its inception in 1990, sending 20,000 college graduates into the nation's neediest classrooms for a two-year commitment. This year, amid a tight job market, it is more popular than ever.\n\n\n\nAccording to the organization's Web site, their teachers get paid the same salary and benefits as beginning teachers in their area and are paid by the local school district.\n\n\n\nAbout 35,000 college seniors applied for the 2009 school year, a 42 percent jump from last year.\n\n\n\n\"We had less competition from Wall Street firms, banks and places like that. It just led a lot of students to really think about what they wanted to do and how they could make an impact,\" said Kevin Huffman, executive director of Teach For America.\n\n\n\n\"Eleven percent of the entire Ivy League senior class applied to join, 20 percent of African-American seniors at Ivy League schools, 8 percent of the University of Michigan and University of North Carolina,\" Huffman said, \"just an incredible outpouring of interest by people competing to teach in low-income communities.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Stanley went through the program and now recruits for Teach For America. He sees education as this generation's civil rights issue and says there is a direct correlation between the program's popularity and President Obama's call to service.\n\n\n\n\"With Obama talking about the need for people with talent to go into public education, and the fact that people are still really frustrated that we live in a country where 90 percent of kids in low-income communities don't go to college, and that the best way we can predict the number of prisons we're going to have to build in 25 years is by looking at third-grade reading skills, and so at this particular moment in time, I think it's really about getting our very best and asking them to go to the root of the problem, and the root of the problem is education.\"\n\n\n\nThis year, Teach For America will place its largest corps ever.\n\n\n\nAbout 4,100 high achievers from the nation's top colleges will head to classrooms in 34 regions across the country, teaching in places like Boston, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Nashville, Tennessee; and in more rural areas such as South Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta.\n\n\n\nBut schools in Appalachia and elsewhere desperately need help.\n\n\n\nHuffman said, \"Districts across the country are facing the same economic pinch that many businesses are facing. And there are just fewer positions across the country available for teachers.\"\n\n\n\nWhich is why a teachers union says those positions should go to career teachers, not inexperienced recruits who may stay only the required two years.\n\n\n\n\"It's very hard to justify laying off teachers who have given service to a school system and then turn around and bring in new teachers,\" argued John Wilson of the National Education Association, the nation's largest professional employee organization for the advancement of public education.\n\n\n\nBesides the matter of taking away potential jobs from career teachers, unions question whether these young recruits have the right credentials and experience to handle tough classrooms.\n\n\n\n\"When you're assigning these teachers to the highest poverty schools, the most challenging schools, these children need the most experienced, the most prepared teachers, and they're not getting them,\" Wilson said, \"and that's quite a disadvantage.\"\n\n\n\nTeach For America maintains that its members go through a rigorous five-week training camp and that while on the job, many pursue a teaching certificate or master's degree in education.\n\n\n\nNew York will be taking 330 corps members into its schools this year. Vicki Bernstein, who is in charge of teacher recruitment and quality for the city's Department of Education, says teachers coming in through alternative programs, like Teach For America, perform as well as teachers from traditional routes.\n\n\n\n\"They serve some of our highest-need children, both in terms of neighborhoods that we have difficulty attracting traditionally prepared teachers and in subject areas where we have difficulty, that teacher colleges are not preparing teachers in those areas.\"\n\n\n\nThe organization says two-thirds of its recruits stay in academics, like Greer, who now plans on teaching as a career. She says her experience in the classroom has been incredibly rewarding.\n\n\n\n\"When the kid makes the two years of reading growth and they have the biggest smile on their face because they achieved their goal through their own hard work,\" she said, \"that feeling that I contributed to that student is the best compliment I can get, because I know that kid is in a better place to succeed in their future.\"",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's newest hotelier Mark Fuller is showing commendable bravado for someone about to open a luxury hotel during a global recession.\n\n\n\nEntrepreneur Mark Fuller in the Sanctum Soho hotel, a rock'n'roll \"haven of hedonism\" in London.\n\n\n\n\"F*** the recession, let's get on with it,\" he says, while sitting on the roof terrace of the Sanctum Soho, a 30-room establishment dubbed the rock'n'roll hotel, as much for its \"anything goes\" service philosophy as the pedigree of its owners, which include the co-managers of heavy metal band Iron Maiden.\n\n\n\n\"We do not recognize there is a credit crunch because we believe you should battle through it,\" Fuller says, adding, \"If you get panicky and scary about things like this, you're no man at all.\"\n\n\n\nBesides, he admits, three years ago when he started working on the concept of an 'alluring haven of hedonism' (as the hotel is described on its Web site), the credit crunch didn't exist.\n\n\n\nAnd by the time it hit, it was too late to pull out. \"We wouldn't do anyway,\" Fuller insists, adding \"fortune favors the brave, as they say.\"  See images of the rock star hotel \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe former band manager turned entrepreneur, is looking quite the rock star tonight, decked head-to-toe in black while a shiny silver skull stares ominously from his belt buckle.\n\n\n\nDownstairs, staff are frantically preparing for a launch party that promises to be heavy on champagne, cocktails and celebrities. It's almost like the crunch doesn't exist.\n\n\n\nThis is Fuller's world and he's hoping plenty of people will want to join it. \"In every downturn in the economic climate I think people look for some affordable glamour and escape,\" he says.\n\n\n\nFuller also owns and runs the Embassy Hotel, an exclusive nightclub in the upmarket London suburb of Mayfair which he plans to franchise in Dubai, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\nThe partners in his new hotel venture ooze rock credential: Iron Maiden co-managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor.\n\n\n\nWhile Taylor has experience running a restaurant and hotel, \"The Inn on the Green,\" Smallwood's experience in the hotel industry is based on 30 years on the road with Iron Maiden.\n\n\n\nLast year he stayed in 80 hotels in 40 countries and one of his biggest gripes is returning to his hotel after a gig and finding the bar is closed.\n\n\n\n\"You want good service, and you want the bars open, and you want good food available,\" he says from the roof terrace equipped with a bar and Jacuzzi he's taken to calling \"my lounge.\"\n\n\n\nSmallwood expects to stay in the hotel once a week and says it will become a London bolt-hole for the band.\n\n\n\nWhile non-music types and the tone-deaf are welcome to stay in the hotel, over-enthusiastic groupies are not.\n\n\n\n\"If you're on the road for three months, you can never escape,\" Smallwood says. \"The fans, some of them, think they have a God-given right, just because they're staying in the same hotel, to put a camera in your face over your cornflakes.\"\n\n\n\n\"The rule here is no autographs and no photographs,\" he says firmly. \"Say Paul Weller is sitting in the corner having a beer, and you go and ask for an autograph or photograph, you will not stay here again.\"\n\n\n\nAlong with privacy and a beer at all hours, guests have access to an on-call guitar doctor, a necessity, apparently, if you break a string while strumming in your room. Guests who have inadvertently left their guitar at home can hire one from reception.\n\n\n\nThe rock star concept extends to the room decor. The silver wallpaper and mirrored columns may appear garish in daylight, but at 3 a.m. one suspects they add a touch of glamour.\n\n\n\nFree standing baths are a bold leap from the bed and the mini bar is well-stocked with champagne.\n\n\n\nRod Smallwood is confident the concept will work.\n\n\n\n\"Recession or no recession, we're talking about 30 rooms in a huge major city. If we can't sell 30 rooms in the depths of recession it means we're useless, and we know we're not.\"\n\n\n\nMark Fuller says he's selling more than a hotel room. In times of economic crisis the Sanctum Soho offers the chance to forget the mortgage and live like a rock star, if only for a day.\n\n\n\n\"You can sit in the restaurant and have a hamburger for seven pounds ($10),\" he says. \"The drinks are cheaper than most hotels, and probably cheaper than most nightclubs. The room accommodation runs everywhere from \u00a3125 ($255) straight up to \u00a3450 ($650). Take your pick. Cut your coat.\"\n\n\n\nI mishear him. \"Cut your coke?\" I ask.\n\n\n\n\"No, you can't do that!\" he exclaims.\n\n\n\n\"Musicians are not like that anymore,\" Fuller says. \"The music industry is such now that people release CDs to support tours, not the other way around, so this is a professional state.\n\n\n\n\"I just don't want to be the hotel at the end of the tour, then I'm in danger,\" he laughs.",

  "context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's foreign ministry said Wednesday that it has lodged a \"strong\" protest with the U.S. ambassador over missile attacks conducted on Pakistani soil by unmanned drones.\n\n\n\nThe aftermath of a suspected U.S. drone attack on a building in North Waziristan.\n\n\n\nThe ministry said it summoned Ambassador Anne Patterson to underscore that such attacks violate Pakistan's sovereignty and should be stopped immediately.\n\n\n\nA statement from the ministry said Patterson was also told that the attacks have cost lives and undermined public support for Pakistan's counter terrorism efforts.\n\n\n\nThe ministry lodged its protests three days after a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people.\n\n\n\nPakistan has repeatedly raised objections to foreign nations violating its sovereignty to pursue terrorists. A U.S. ground operation in September that left several civilians dead rankled relations between the two countries.\n\n\n\nLast week, Pakistan's parliament passed a resolution that condemned any incursion on Pakistani soil by foreign forces.\n\n\n\nThe resolution called for a review of the country's national security strategy and said the government needs to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n\n\nThe ministry said it handed Patterson a copy of the resolution.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. and NATO, which have troops in Afghanistan, have been seeking a way to effectively battle militants who launch attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border.\n\n\n\nThey have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years, saying it is not being proactive enough against militants -- a claim Pakistan denies.\n\n\n\nThe United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely.\n\n\n\nIn another development, suspected Taliban militants kidnapped three government officials from an administrative office in Pakistan's tribal region Wednesday, officials said.\n\n\n\nThe militants abducted two employees and a security guard from the Ambar district in Mohmand Agency.\n\n\n\nMohmand is in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where U.S. and Pakistani officials have reported a presence of militants.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, militants tried unsuccessfully to take control of a school in Mohmand and abduct about 100 students, authorities said. A shootout with Frontier Corps followed, in which one militant was killed and another arrested.\n\n\n\nThe Frontier Corps is a paramilitary force which uses recruits from Pakistan's tribal areas and is overseen by Pakistani army officers.\n\n\n\nAlso Wednesday, a suicide car bomber detonated explosives outside a police checkpoint in northwest Pakistan, killing two security personnel, officials said.\n\n\n\nThe Wednesday afternoon attack in the Bannu district of the North West Frontier Province also wounded a dozen people, military sources said.\n\n\n\nThe bomber targeted a check point near a military hospital, said the sources who did not want their names revealed because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\n\n\nCNN's Reza Sayah and journalist Janullah Hashimzada contributed to this report",

  "context": "(CNN) -- More than 1,100 people worldwide have died from swine flu since it emerged in Mexico and the U.S. in April, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization.\n\n\n\nA young girl wears a mask at a hospital in Hanoi. Vietnam reported its first death from swine flu this week.\n\n\n\nAs of July 31, the total number of victims killed by the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, stood at 1,154 -- an increase of 338 since WHO's previous update on July 27.\n\n\n\nThe virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed, spreading as widely in six weeks as common influenza viruses spread in the six months, according to WHO.\n\n\n\nWHO data showed the total number of laboratory confirmed cases at 162,380, but the number could be higher since individual cases no longer have to be tested or reported.\n\n\n\nThe total number of countries and territories reporting at least one case of infection now stands at 168, with new cases reported in Azerbaijan, Gabon, Grenada, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Monaco, Nauru, Swaziland and Suriname.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, federal health officials are worried about the upcoming flu season.\n\n\n\nThey say nearly 160 million Americans may need to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus, but it won't be as simple as a single shot.\n\n\n\nIn a background briefing with reporters on Tuesday, two senior administration officials said the vaccine, which is still in clinical trials, would require two shots. The first shot would be followed by a second shot three weeks later. Immunity to the virus would finally kick in two weeks after that.\n\n\n\nThat means someone who is vaccinated by the time the program is expected to launch in late October won't get protection until late fall.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, British-based pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline announced it had signed contracts with nine governments to provide 96 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and was in ongoing discussions with governments to provide further supplies.\n\n\n\nGlaxoSmithKline has already signed deals worth $250 million in total to provide 195 million doses and plans to donate 50 million doses to the World Health Organization.\n\n\n\n\"First supplies of the vaccine will be available to governments from September onwards, with shipments expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010,\" GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement. \"The exact pace of delivery will be dependent on capacity and the yield of the influenza strain.\"\n\n\n\nDetails of the immunization program were revealed as part of the government's overall plan to deal with what is expected to be a difficult flu season.\n\n\n\nThe federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week issued sweeping guidelines for a vaccination campaign against the swine flu strain, identifying more than half the population as targets for the first round of vaccinations.\n\n\n\nThe priority groups include pregnant women, health care and emergency services personnel, children, adolescents and young adults from six months to 24 years of age, household and caregiver contacts of children younger than six months and healthy adults with certain medical conditions.\n\n\n\nThe symptoms of swine flu are similar to that of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, aches and runny nose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A significant number of infected people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting.",

  "context": "LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Kashi Shodeinde turned the ignition and his battered truck convulsed as black fumes poured from the exhaust. His precious cargo of bottled Guinness beer rattled as he set off into the gauntlet of Lagos' potholed roads and traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria consumes more Guinness beer than Ireland, the company says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking for a foreign company to send his three children to school, Shodeinde is on the frontline of private investors' struggle to gain a foothold in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the whole of Nigeria, Guinness is No. 1!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrewed in Nigeria since 1962, the country's thicker-tasting \"Foreign Extra\" is not just supporting Shodeinde and his family, but helped Guinness Nigeria defy the global recession with 6 percent annual growth this year, according to the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria now drinks more Guinness than Ireland -- making it the second-biggest consumer in the world, after Britain, according to Guinness Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA success story like Guinness in Nigeria highlights the potential for trade and foreign investment in Africa that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about last week when she addressed an African trade convention in Kenya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Africa is capable, and is making economic progress. In fact, one doesn't have to look far to see that Africa is ripe with opportunities, some already realized, and others waiting to be seized together if we determine to do so,\" Clinton said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is on a tour of Africa to promote development and good governance, and to underscore the Obama administration's commitment to Africa. Nigeria is one of several countries on her itinerary.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut many challenges keep foreign businesses from coming to Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarded as a frontier market, Nigeria is ranked 118 out of 187 in the World Bank's \"Doing Business\" rankings. Failing infrastructure, irregular electricity and erratic government policies have caused foreign investors to shy from Nigeria's relatively untapped market of 150 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nigeria remains an information dark spot and therefore does itself no advantage in terms of trying to attract foreign investment,\" said Doyin Salami, an economist at Lagos Business School.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dunlop and Michelin tire companies have in recent years closed their factories in Nigeria, because of the rising cost of production.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, Nigeria Guinness is expanding its facilities to increase production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Business is really growing,\" said Afebuameh Cephas, the plant manager for Guinness' Benin factory, saying production was up almost 30 percent in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the ingredients are produced locally -- except for Guinness extract, a secret ingredient added to Guinness brewed anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's no secret to Guinness' Nigeria success, said Chairman Tunde Savage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most important thing here is you have to be very transparent in what you do. Your governing principle must be very clear here. You must ensure you do things correctly and rightly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately for competitors, Guinness is not to everyone's taste.\n\n\n\n\n\nBottles of all shapes and flavors rattled on a bar table in Lagos one recent night as a band struck a deep bass note in the humidity of the night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's too harsh! It's too harsh!\" one regular exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It tastes good for an African man!\" argued another.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth has been suspended indefinitely by the National Football League, days after he pleaded guilty to killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol, the NFL said.\n\n\n\nCleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth on Tuesday pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter.\n\n\n\nStallworth, 28, pleaded guilty in a Florida court Tuesday to DUI manslaughter charges in the March death of construction worker Mario Reyes. Under terms of a plea agreement, he will serve 30 days. Prosecutors said he began serving his sentence immediately.\n\n\n\n\"The conduct reflected in your guilty plea resulted in the tragic loss of life and was inexcusable,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told Stallworth in a letter Thursday, the league said. Excerpts from the letter were posted on the NFL Web site.\n\n\n\n\"While the criminal justice system has determined the legal consequences of this incident, it is my responsibility as NFL commissioner to determine appropriate league discipline for your actions, which have caused irreparable harm to the victim and his family, your club, your fellow players and the NFL.\"\n\n\n\nStallworth's suspension is effective immediately, the league said. Goodell wrote in the letter that \"in due course\" the league would contact his attorney to schedule a meeting with him, after which a final determination would be made on discipline.\n\n\n\nStallworth was driving his black Bentley GT east on the MacArthur Causeway, which connects Miami, Florida, to the South Beach area of Miami Beach, when he struck Reyes on the morning of March 14, according to prosecutors. He had been drinking at a Miami Beach club, according to court documents. His blood alcohol level was 0.126 percent, prosecutors said; Florida's legal limit is 0.08.\n\n\n\nReyes, 59, reportedly was heading to a bus stop after work when he was struck. Court documents said he suffered \"critical head, chest and abdominal injuries\" and died at a hospital.\n\n\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene, Stallworth told them he was the driver of the car and admitted striking Reyes.\n\n\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Stallworth offered his \"deepest condolences to the Reyes family.\"\n\n\n\n\"Though I cannot bring back Mr. Reyes or ease his family's pain, I can and will honor his memory by committing my time, my resources and my voice by educating this community about the dangers of drunk driving,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStallworth could have served up to 15 years in prison. But State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle noted in a statement that he cooperated with authorities and had no previous criminal record or traffic violations. Reyes' family supported the plea agreement, she said.\n\n\n\nStallworth's attorney, Chris Lyons, on Tuesday told CNN sister network HLN that Stallworth had reached an \"amicable\" financial settlement with Reyes' family but would not disclose the amount. He said the length of Stallworth's jail term \"had nothing to do with Donte Stallworth being a celebrity, a professional football player or money.\"\n\n\n\nStallworth has shown \"genuine remorse\" and accepted responsibility for his actions, Lyons said.\n\n\n\nGoodell wrote Stallworth that there is \"ample evidence to warrant significant discipline\" under both the NFL's personal conduct and substance abuse policies. \"There is no reasonable dispute that your continued eligibility for participation at this time would undermine the integrity of and public confidence in the league,\" the letter said.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone associated with the league derives tremendous benefits from participating in our game and from the extraordinary support we receive from the public,\" Goodell wrote. \"With these benefits comes, among other things, the responsibility to conduct ourselves in a lawful and responsible way, with no entitlement to or expectation of favorable treatment.\"\n\n\n\nGoodell notified NFL clubs earlier this year that there would be increased emphasis on addressing driving under the influence and other misconduct, the league said. It noted the NFL offers a \"safe rides\" program used by most clubs to provide players and other employees with alternative transportation if they have been drinking.\n\n\n\nUnder terms of Stallworth's plea agreement, he will face two years of house arrest upon his release. He is also required to donate $2,500 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, serve eight years of probation and submit to random drug and alcohol testing throughout his probation. His driver's license was permanently revoked.\n\n\n\nCNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.",

  "context": "DERBY, England -- Substitute Emmanuel Adebayor struck his second hat-trick against Derby this season as Arsenal ran riot with a 6-2 Premier League victory at Pride Park.\n\n\n\nArsenal players celebrate Robin Van Persie's goal in their comfortable 6-2 victory over Derby.\n\n\n\nThe Gunners, 5-0 winners at The Emirates earlier in the season, made sure of third place in the table with a rousing second-half display against relegated Derby, who move closer to being the Premier League's worst-ever side.\n\n\n\nArsene Wenger's side led 2-1 at the break after goals from Nicklas Bendtner and Robin van Persie either side of a Jay McEveley effort.\n\n\n\nTheo Walcott was on target too, but the second half belonged to Togo international striker Adebayor, who struck three times to take his season's tally to 30 in all competitions, with Rob Earnshaw grabbing a consolation for the hosts in this eight-goal thriller.\n\n\n\nBottom side Derby, now 30 league games without a victory, began the more purposefully and Emanuel Villa only just failed to connect Tyrone Mears' inviting low cross .\n\n\n\nThen Mile Sterjovski's drive took a major deflection off Alex Song to wrong-foot goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, making his first league start for Arsenal, only for the ball to creep past the right-hand post.\n\n\n\nThe Gunners struggled to find their rhythm early on and were fortunate not to go behind when Villa's bullet header flew just over.\n\n\n\nDerby were made to pay for those early misses when Darren Moore's 25th minute mistake presented the ball to Niklas Bendtner, who played a one-two with Robin Van Persie before coolly slotting the ball into the left corner.\n\n\n\nHowever, Derby soon scored the equalizer they deserved. Robbie Savage's inswinging free-kick landed on the six-yard line and Jay McEveley reacted first to hook the ball home.\n\n\n\nThe home side's joy was short-lived though, when Derby's defensive frailties were exposed again as Van Persie as given all the time in the world to chest down Kolo Toure's floated pass and volley home in style.\n\n\n\nAdebayor replaced Van Persie for the second-half and Arsenal immediately looked intent on adding to their goals tally.\n\n\n\nTwice Kolo Toure, playing at right-back, fired over, the second opportunity created by Cesc Fabregas' brilliant backheel.\n\n\n\nThere was nothing goalkeeper Roy Carroll could do to deny Adebayor Arsenal's third goal. Walcott took advantage of  Alan Stubbs' slip to cut the ball back to Emmanuel Eboue, who gave Adebayor an easy finish.\n\n\n\nWalcott should have made it four when he was put through by Bendtner but the teenager fired wide with the goal at his mercy.\n\n\n\nBy now it was looking all too easy for the Gunners as they toyed with home side, creating chances at will -- but against the run of play Derby reduced the deficit to just a single goal when substitute Robert Earnshaw stroked the ball home.\n\n\n\nYet within a minute the two-goal cushion was restored, Gael Clichy pinging a pinpoint pass to Walcott wide on the left before the youngster cut inside and curled into the top-right corner.\n\n\n\nAdebayor grabbed another poacher's goal, sliding to convert another Clichy assist with 10 minutes remaining before he wrapped up his hat-trick from an acute angle in added time.\n\n\n\nWith two games remaining, Arsenal are four points behind Manchester United and Chelsea, still with an outside chance of lifting the Premier League title.

  "context": "(CNN) -- There are few cities in the world blessed with a more beautiful setting than Seattle. It is surrounded by rugged green wilderness; to the west the Olympic Mountains, to the east the volcanoes and glaciers of the Cascade Range, and all around the brisk waters of the Northwest.\n\n\n\nThe Space Needle dominates the Seattle skyline.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Seattle has inspired a number of nicknames. It's not hard to understand why some refer to it as \"Rain City,\" but visit when the sun is shining, when lakes Union and Washington are sparkling under a blue sky and majestic Mount Rainier is visible in the distance, and you'll realize that \"Emerald City\" is the most appropriate of its monikers.\n\n\n\nSeattle started out as a logging town, grew as a stop-off point for gold prospectors at the end of the 19th century, and earned another nickname, \"Jet City\", when plane manufacturer Boeing rose to prominence in the 1950s and 60s. At the height of its powers, Boeing employed some 100,000 locals and the Jet City remained a solidly working-class town until the 80s, when local startup Microsoft started making a name for itself.\n\n\n\nAs Microsoft grew into the behemoth it is today, other tech firms such as Amazon.com and Nintendo were drawn to the city, bringing with them a wave of young, educated and affluent workers.\n\n\n\nSeattle began to shake off its blue-collar roots and in recent years its cultural credentials have been boosted by the addition of the Olympic Sculpture Park and a showpiece public library, while the acclaimed Seattle Symphony, Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet have all moved into impressive new buildings in the last decade.\n\n\n\nSome resent Seattle's gentrification, bemoaning the near-gridlocked traffic and arguing that the city's most interesting neighborhoods have lost their individuality to the property developers. But if you spend some time in neighborhoods like Capitol Hill or Fremont, the self-proclaimed \"Center of the Universe,\" you'll find there's still plenty of the native free spirit in evidence.\n\n\n\nIt was that free spirit that gave birth to Grunge, the post-punk guitar noise that came out of the city in the early 90s, when local bands Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Nirvana became international stars. Now Grunge is just a memory, but in popular culture it remains as much of a symbol of the city as the Space Needle, the persistent drizzle and the excellent, ubiquitous, coffee shops.\n\n\n\nDespite its rapid growth, Seattle has kept its trees and parks and many areas maintain an almost suburban feel. The city and its residents are laidback and liberal, and that famous free spirit is as at home in the great outdoors as in Seattle's boho neighborhoods. As a modern, civilized outpost among outstanding natural spectacle, the place once known as the \"Queen City of the Northwest\" still reigns supreme.",

This moment means 'everything is possible' \u00bb\n\nWhen our bus pulled into Maryland on the eve of the inauguration, I knew after hearing the words of my fellow passengers, in some sense fellow pilgrims, that I was in the midst of a moment of history like maybe no other I had ever witnessed -- certainly in terms of its historic magnitude, and certainly not in America.\n\nIt is the words of these passengers, and those of many others that I have met in the past two days, that are representative to some degree of what this moment means.

He left the firm in February 2007 to become the nation's second director of national intelligence.\n\n\n\nIn a farewell letter obtained by CNN, McConnell thanked his colleagues for their hard work and touted some of the accomplishments during his tenure.\n\n\n\nAt the top of his list: passage of legislation revising the law governing intelligence community eavesdropping and updating the presidential order that outlines the power and authorities of the community.\n\n\n\n\"These documents lay a foundation to provide the IC the structure and the tools needed to continue our work, while expanding privacy and civil liberties protections to all Americans,\" wrote McConnell.\n\n\n\nThe office was created in late 2004 as part of the effort to improve intelligence gathering after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and the faulty intelligence on Iraq weapons of mass destruction.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- For almost a week, tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in daily protests -- handkerchiefs shielding their faces from the pungency of tear gas, fists punching the air, and chants of \"Down with the dictator\" echoing against buildings.\n\n\n\nMoussovi supporters rally Wednesday in Tehran, Iran. Released by Fars News Agency of Iran.\n\n\n\nThe massive outpouring is a result of a disputed presidential election that the protesters think coronated the incumbent hard-liner, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, over their candidate, Mir Hossain Moussavi.\n\n\n\nContext can help put their grievances into perspective:\n\n\n\nQ. The Iran that we know today is the result of the Islamic Revolution. What is it?\n\n\n\nA. The Islamic Revolution is the name given to the Iranian revolution of 1979, when the ruling U.S.-supported monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile.  See timeline of recent Iranian history \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe country held a national referendum to become an Islamic republic and approve a new constitution.\n\n\n\nThe constitution was a hybrid of democracy and unelected religious leadership. It appointed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- the leader of the revolution -- the supreme leader of the country.\n\n\n\nBefore he died in 1989, he made it known that he wanted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to succeed him.\n\n\n\nQ. Is it true that the ultimate power in Iran lies with Khamenei?\n\n\n\nA. Yes. The supreme leader has the final say in all important matters of the country, such as ties with foreign nations or Iran's nuclear aspirations.\n\n\n\nHe appoints the Guardian Council -- the country's election authority. He also appoints key posts in the intelligence services and the armed forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Additionally, he confirms the president's election.\n\n\n\nIn theory, the supreme leader is appointed by a body of clerics whom voters elect. But in practice, this body -- the Assembly of Experts -- has answered to the supreme leader.\n\n\n\nKhamenei, 70, was appointed supreme leader for life in 1989.\n\n\n\nQ. What is the Guardian Council, which has been in the news, saying it will recount some of the votes in the disputed election?\n\n\n\nA. The unelected Guardian Council is the second-most influential body in Iran politics. It consists of six theologians whom the supreme leader picks and six jurists nominated by the judiciary and approved by parliament.\n\n\n\nThe council approves all candidates running for office in the country, and verifies election results.\n\n\n\nIt vetoes bills passed by the parliament if they do not conform to the constitution and Islamic law.\n\n\n\nIn the present crisis, opposition leader Moussavi has had to take his grievance to the Guardian Council. It has agreed to some vote recounts.  See galleries of protests in Iran \u00bb\n\n\n\nQ. So, how much power does the president wield?\n\n\n\nA. It depends on how nicely he plays with the Guardian Council.\n\n\n\nThe president is elected by direct vote to a four-year term, for a maximum of two terms.\n\n\n\nHe is responsible for economic policy and social programs, but most of the larger decisions are made by the supreme leader.\n\n\n\nIn theory, his powers are second to the supreme leader's. But in practice, he is often hamstrung by the Guardian Council.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian Council has worked with hard-liner Ahmadinejad, a 53-year-old former mayor of Tehran who was elected in 2005. But it thwarted reform attempts by his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami.\n\n\n\nQ. What is the Revolutionary Guard, who said they will take legal action against pro-Moussavi Web sites?\n\n\n\nA. The guard was initially created to protect the leaders of the revolution. But over the years, it has broadened its scope. Today, it is directly under the control of the supreme leader and enforces the governments' Islamic codes and morality\n\n\n\nWith more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals.\n\n\n\nQ. What is the Basij, who are said to be behind most of the violence against opposition supporters?\n\n\n\nA. The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard. It plays the role of de facto morality police and is often summoned to crack down on protests.\n\n\n\nIt is unknown how large the force is, though estimates are in the millions.\n\n\n\nQ. What evidence is there of ballot fraud?\n\n\n\nA. There are no concrete examples of fraud, because independent monitors did not oversee polling in Iran, but the circumstantial evidence is persuasive.\n\n\n\nThe government had initially said it would take three days to verify the ballots after Election Day on June 12. But the election authority proclaimed Ahmadinejad the winner two hours after the polls closed. At the same time, the interior ministry said that 85 percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters had cast ballots -- a record turnout.\n\n\n\nTo many, so many ballots could not have been hand-counted in such a short time.\n\n\n\nAlso, the published results showed that Ahmadinejad won even in his opponents' strongholds, including Moussavi's hometown of ethnic Azeri Turks.\n\n\n\n\"This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African-American vote to John McCain in 2008,\" said Karim Sajadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Moussavi went into the election with massive support from the country's youth, who were unhappy with the faltering economy and an unemployment rate that tops 30 percent by some accounts. The youth make up 60 percent of Iran's population of 70 million.\n\n\n\nQ. Is it true that Ahmadinejad still enjoys widespread support?\n\n\n\nA. Yes. Ahmadinejad is popular across Iran's rural areas and among the Basij militia.\n\n\n\nHe presents himself as a populist and a fighter. He has paid attention to the families of the bloody Iran-Iraq war, offering special preferences to veterans' children in university admissions.\n\n\n\nAs president, his hardline approach has won him support among the Guardian Council. He has earned a reputation internationally as a fundamentalist for his Holocaust denials, calls to annihilate Israel, and cat-and-mouse games with the United States and the United Nations over Iran's nuclear activities. Many in the establishment view him as someone who does not cower to big-footing by the West.\n\n\n\nQ. Why, then, do some analysts think the vote was manipulated?\n\n\n\nA. Some experts say that even if it is likely that Ahmadinejad won the election, it is unlikely he could have won by the margin the government is claiming -- 62.63 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nTime magazine's Joe Klein explains it this way: \"It is entirely possible that Ahmadinejad would have won anyway, but narrowly, perhaps with less than 50 percent of the vote, setting up a runoff election he might have lost as the other candidates united against him. It is possible that his government, perhaps acting in concert with supreme leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, decided to take no chances.\"\n\n\n\nQ. Why is Iran's population so young?\n\n\n\nA. After the revolution, the leaders encouraged early marriage and large families, rewarding families with cars and television sets for each additional child. During the country's devastating eight-year war with Iraq, which began in 1980, the regime continued encouraging population growth, because more children meant more future soldiers.\n\n\n\nIt is those children who are now coming of age.\n\n\n\nQ. Why did Iran summon Switzerland's ambassador to complain about perceived U.S. involvement in Iran's election process?\n\n\n\nA. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Iran following the hostage crisis in 1979, when students in support of the Islamic Revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days.\n\n\n\nQ. Is this movement a challenge to the Islamic republic?\n\n\n\nA. The demonstrators say their demand is simple: Hold fresh elections. They say they are not out to challenge the Islamic regime.  Watch protests Wednesday in Tehran \u00bb\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Moussavi is an unlikely man for the job.\n\n\n\nThough the 67-year-old former prime minister is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during the Iran-Iraq war, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a \"firm radical.\"\n\n\n\nHe, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of the American hostages in 1979. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use.\n\n\n\nThe protests have exposed a fissure in the country, however, with tens of thousands of Ahmadinejad backers taking to the streets in a show of force of their own.\n\n\n\nQ. Are the current protests likely to continue?\n\n\n\nA. For now, the government seems to be allowing the populace to vent pent-up frustrations. But it also is gradually cracking down, such as blocking Web sites and banning international journalists from filming the rallies.\n\n\n\nThe demonstrations have so far been focused on urban areas. Should the populace in rural areas take up the call for reform, the government might step in quickly to quash the protests, analysts say.  See map of demonstration sites in Tehran \u00bb\n\n\n\nQ. Is this the first time Iranians have risen up in mass protests against the regime?\n\n\n\nA. No. Iran has twice seen public calls for reform in recent years: in 1999, after the closing of a reformist newspaper, and after parliamentary elections in 2000.\n\n\n\nOn both occasions, the Revolutionary Guard descended on the streets after a few days and crushed the movements.\n\n\n\nQ. So, can true reform come to Iran?\n\n\n\nA. It is possible. Ahmadinejad's predecessor, Khatami, was elected president in 1997 by a landslide, despite being a reformer. During his two terms, he championed freedom of expression, tried to mend diplomatic relations, and supported a free market. He was, however, hamstrung at every step by stiff resistance from the supreme leader and the Guardian Council.\n\n\n\nThis report includes information from various sources, including the U.S. State Department, the CIA Factbook, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, previous CNN reports and guest commentaries.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- As the powerhouses of the rugby world continue to battle over the Web Ellis trophy in the knockout stages of the World Cup, some of the sport's less-fancied teams are making their way home after a valiant, if unsuccessful, fight in the group stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the tournament began in 1987, only four nations have walked away as world champions: New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and England.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada's Canucks, Georgia's Lelos or the U.S. Eagles were never the bookmakers' favorites to win the Cup and for obvious reasons. These emerging nations do not compete anywhere near as regularly as the elite sides and, along with tactical and experience deficiencies, face a daunting challenge to emerge from the bruising challenge of the pool matches in the world's most prestigious event.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these teams do have heart and motivation and -- perhaps most of all -- they have the joy and passion of national pride. Whether or not they walk away with wins, it's being there, representing their nations and improving the standard of rugby within their countries, that matters most for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When that flag is waving and the anthem plays before the game, if that doesn't get you going, you need to see a cardiologist,\" former Eagles player and coach Jack Clark told CNN. \"It's just one of those moments where you feel not only a lot of responsibility, but you feel really privileged to have that responsibility.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLelos making strides\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia did not make an appearance in the Rugby World Cup until 2003, but the they became an overnight sensation during that year's tournament with their passionate play, despite not actually winning a match.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lelos, named after an indigenous Georgian sport similar to rugby, also qualified for the 2007 finals and nearly caused a sensation by coming within a whisker of beating established nation Ireland. Just 11 days later, they beat Namibia 30-0 to record their first World Cup success.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a nation that considers rugby to be a minority sport, Georgia are supported by an intensely loyal fan base and host a number of players who regularly compete in France, adding to their level of conditioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The strength of our team is in our physicality,\" media manager Lasha Khurtsidze told CNN. \"We always have very good forwards and our scrum is considered to be in the top five in the world. Our players have a very strong sense of pride and courage. They play like they are on a battlefield protecting their country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia qualified for this year's tournament after defeating Russia 36-8 and winning the European Nations Cup in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are determined to show the world that we are not underdogs,\" Khurtsidze added. \"We want to prove that we deserve a place among the elite teams. We aim more at playing with dignity rather than winning, however, to win one or two matches is very important because expectations are very high here in Georgia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this year's tournament, Georgia narrowly lost to Scotland, England and Argentina, but beat Romania 25-7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Georgia surpassed expectations in this year's World Cup,\" Alex Payne, a Sky Sports broadcaster who regularly covers rugby, told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would have expected them to have lost more heavily to Scotland, England and Argentina, given those teams would have been very aware of what Georgia are capable of. Georgia were not taken lightly by any of those teams, and yet still, the margins of victory were more than respectable for a side that doesn't get that much competitive play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Georgia have come a long way in a short state of time,\" Payne added. \"If they can add a bit more creativity and flair behind what they've got up front, then they will push forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEye on the Eagles\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Eagles have participated in each World Cup since 1987 (except 1995, when they did not qualify), but going into this year's Cup, they had only ever won only two matches, both against Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough they are a national team, the Eagles are not considered part of the professional game. The U.S. players were exposed to rugby in high school or college and many are former American football players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are regular people with normal jobs who have learned to challenge themselves outside the usual lifestyle,\" Julie McCoy, coach of the USA sevens side, told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The majority of those players have come through the high school and college All-American system over the last 10 years. They finally have a pathway. It's not just a bunch of guys saying 'Hey, who wants to go represent the U.S. in the World Cup?' That was the mechanism 10 years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile other countries were holding training camps in July, the Eagles were unable to practice as a team, according to head coach Eddie O'Sullivan. When the players do get together, they have to make up for lost time in addition to preparing for a global tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a pretty meager existence, but we make those sacrifices so we can get our proper training and conditioning in,\" Eagles center Paul Emerick told CNN. \"It's a testament to the guys who are dedicated. Everyone wants to be here and put their time in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main core of the current U.S. squad played together in the 2007 tournament, and the players have managed to maintain a tight chemistry. That, combined with the pride they take in representing their country on a world stage, provides Team USA with its greatest strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ultimate thing you want to do is represent your country,\" Eagles lock Scot LaValla told CNN. \"That's the dream, the goal, the end result if you're really committed to your sport. One of the things I'm constantly impressed with is the chemistry on the team. Physically you have a team here who is strong as any other team, but our commitment to each other is an asset.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eagles fell to Ireland and Italy , and were thrashed 67-5 by Australia. However, they achieved an important goal by defeating Russia 13-6, a result that saw them finish fourth in Pool C, ahead of the Russians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would expect that they wanted to beat Russia by more,\" Payne said. \"The disappointing thing for them will be the hammering at the hands of Australia. That is the kind of gap they will want to close in the future. They will be disappointed not to have made more of a statement at the Cup, but they showed that they've got some really talented players.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCanucks still improving\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada have appeared in every World Cup since 1987 and have already qualified for the 2015 tournament. in England. Going into this year's tournament, the Canucks were the top qualifying Americas team and have continued to improve in rank throughout the year. But they have only made it past the pool phase once, in 1991, where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals by New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada entered this years tournament in good stead with victories over the U.S. and maintained that form with a 25-20 success over Tonga.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefeat against France followed, before a tense 23-23 draw against Japan. Former Canadian international Gareth Rees told CNN: \"They've been really honest and hardworking in this tournament despite not everything being perfect. In terms of their attitude and setting up for the next four years, it's been an outstanding World Cup.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada were thrashed 79-15 by host nation and tournament favorites New Zealand in their final match and Rees believes if the Canucks want to improve on the international stage, they need to re-evaluate their structure, beginning with a bigger pool of players to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest issue is we have is to be playing at a higher intensity,\" he said. \"We need more regular games at a higher level, so when we get to the pool games, the intensity and the mental preparation isn't quite as much of a shock to the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to see us knocking on the door, like when Tonga upset France. I'd like it if Canada could be that team upsetting other teams -- I think we can get up there to being at the top of the Tier 2 nations.\"",

The find reinforces the pilot's report that the plane was brought down by a flock of birds.\n\n\n\nPilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger, 58, told investigators his aircraft struck birds, disabling both engines, about 90 seconds after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York.\n\n\n\nThe feather, found on a flap track on the wing, was also sent to identification experts at the Smithsonian Institution last month.\n\n\n\nThe pilot ditched the Airbus A320 in the Hudson River and passengers tried to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current.\n\n\n\nAll 155 crew members and passengers on the plane survived the incident, which New York Gov. David Paterson dubbed a \"miracle on the Hudson.\"",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The world's population is forecast to hit 7 billion in 2011, the vast majority of its growth coming in developing and, in many cases, the poorest nations, a report released Wednesday said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRiders cram into a train last month in New Delhi, India. India's population is expected to be 1.7 billion by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nA staggering 97 percent of global growth over the next 40 years will happen in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Population Reference Bureau's 2009 World Population Data Sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The great bulk of today's 1.2 billion youth -- nearly 90 percent -- are in developing countries,\" said Carl Haub, a co-author of the report. Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During the next few decades, these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities, gainful employment, and adequate health care,\" Haub continued, calling it one of the major social questions of the next few decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the developed world, the United States and Canada will account for most of the growth -- half from immigration and half from a natural increase in the population -- births minus deaths, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh fertility rates and a young population base in the developing world will fuel most of the growth, especially in Africa, where women often give birth to six or seven children over a lifetime, the report says. The number is about two in the United States and 1.5 in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nA stark contrast can be drawn between Uganda and Canada, which currently have about 34 million and 31 million residents, respectively. By 2050, Canada's population is projected to be 42 million, while Uganda's is expected to soar to 96 million, more than tripling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even with declining fertility rates in many countries, world population is still growing at a rapid rate,\" said Bill Butz, president of the bureau. \"The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years, as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion. Both events are unprecedented in world history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050, India is projected to be the world's most populous nation at 1.7 billion, overtaking current leader China, which is forecast to hit 1.4 billion. The United States is expected to reach 439 million for No. 3 on the list.",

Watch Anderson Cooper name the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2008 \u00bb\n\n\n\nCNN launched its second annual global search for ordinary people accomplishing extraordinary deeds in February. The network has aired weekly CNN Hero profiles of those people, chosen from more than 3,700 nominations submitted by viewers in 75 countries.\n\n\n\nA panel made up of world leaders and luminaries recognized for their own dedication to public service selected the Top 10. The Blue Ribbon Panel includes humanitarians such as Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, Jane Goodall, Kristi Yamaguchi and Deepak Chopra.\n\n\n\n\"What an incredible group of people and how difficult it was to select only 10,\" said Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, a panel member.\n\n\n\nArchbishop Tutu added, \"They all deserve to win. Thanks for saluting these remarkable human beings.\"\n\n\n\nEach of this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes will receive $25,000 and will be honored at \"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\" airing from the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on November 27.\n\n\n\nHosted by Cooper, the Thanksgiving night broadcast will culminate with the announcement of the CNN Hero of the Year, selected by the public in an online poll that began Thursday morning. iReport.com: Tell us about your hero\n\n\n\nContinuing through November 19, viewers can log on to CNN.com/Heroes to participate in the poll. The person receiving the most votes will receive an additional $100,000.\n\n\n\nIn alphabetical order, the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2008 are:\n\n\n\nTad Agoglia, Houston, Texas --  Agoglia's First Response Team provides immediate help to areas hit by natural disasters. In a little over a year, he and his crew have aided thousands of victims at more than 15 sites across the United States, free of charge.\n\n\n\nYohannes Gebregeorgis, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia -- Moved by the lack of children's books and low literacy rates in his native Ethiopia, Gebregeorgis established Ethiopia Reads, bringing free public libraries and literacy programs to thousands of Ethiopian children.\n\n\n\nCarolyn LeCroy, Norfolk, Virginia -- After serving time in prison, LeCroy started The Messages Project to help children stay connected with their incarcerated parents. She and volunteer camera crews have taped roughly 3,000 messages from inmates to their children.\n\n\n\nAnne Mahlum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- On her daily morning jogs, Mahlum used to run past homeless men. Today, she's helping to transform lives by running with them, and others as part of her \"Back On My Feet\" program.\n\n\n\nLiz McCartney, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana -- McCartney moved to New Orleans to dedicate herself to helping Hurricane Katrina survivors move back into their homes. Her nonprofit St. Bernard Project has rebuilt the homes of more than 120 families for free.\n\n\n\nPhymean Noun, Toronto, Ontario -- Growing up in Cambodia, Noun struggled to complete high school. Today, she offers hundreds of Cambodian children who work in Phnom Penh's trash dump a way out -- through free schooling and job training.\n\n\n\nDavid Puckett, Savannah, Georgia -- Puckett started Positive Image Prosthetics and Orthotics Missions -- PIPO -- to provide artificial limbs and braces and care to people in southeastern Mexico.  Since November 2000 his mission has helped more than 420 people, free of charge.\n\n\n\nMaria Ruiz, El Paso, Texas -- Several times a week, Ruiz crosses the border into Juarez, Mexico, to bring food, clothing and toys to hundreds of impoverished children and their families.\n\n\n\nMarie Da Silva, Los Angeles, California -- Having lost 14 family members to AIDS, the Los Angeles nanny funds a school in her native Malawi -- where half a million children have been orphaned by the disease.\n\n\n\nViola Vaughn, Kaolack, Senegal -- The Detroit, Michigan, native moved to Senegal to retire. Instead, a group of failing schoolchildren asked her to help them pass their classes. Today, her \"10,000 Girls\" program is helping hundreds of girls succeed in school and run their own businesses.\n\n\n\n\"It is very rewarding to be able to honor these amazing, often unheralded individuals who are making a tremendous difference in their communities and beyond,\" Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide, said. \"These stories of selfless achievement deserve to be told, and our multiple platforms around the world allow us to do that.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- If you've booked travel online, you may have been there.\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Cutter, a travel agent in Charlotte, North Carolina, discusses vacation options with a client.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline travel sites flooded with overwhelming options, all claiming the best deals. Extra fees nestled into the fine print amid blaring advertisements. Pounding 16 digits into the telephone after you've booked the wrong flight before finally getting a human voice.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, Darin Kaplan, a tech-savvy 27-year-old California restaurant manager, clicked his mouse hundreds of times, surfing the vast choices offered by online travel booking Web sites like Expedia.com and Orbitz.com to plan his 28th birthday cruise to Mexico before he gave up in frustration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a cut-and-paste experience when you're booking online. None of these sites are going to tell me what I can do with different options,\" said Kaplan, who uses the Internet for many purchases, including his basketball shorts and music tickets. \"Travel agents know what they are talking about. It's more comforting to hand my money to someone who has the knowledge and experience.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome travelers like Kaplan are finding themselves defecting from travel booking sites like Travelocity.com or airline sites like Delta.com. They are going back the travel agent, an industry that many industry experts once thought to be pass\u00e9 with the advent of online booking.\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer travelers are enjoying using the Web to plan and buy trips, according to a study last week by Forrester Research, a market research company. About 46 percent of U.S. leisure travelers enjoyed using the Internet to book travel this year, down from 53 percent in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficult site navigation and presentation on travel company sites and hotel and airline sites are causing a growing number of travelers to shift away from the Web and consider using alternative methods of booking travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are saying 'I don't understand my options, and I would like to talk to someone who can do all the searching and tell me what's available,' \" said Henry Hartevelt, the analyst who wrote the Forrester study. \"Major travel agencies have absolutely failed in their responsibility to innovate and think of creative new ways to help their customers shop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the brick-and-mortar travel agent model, a trained agent meets with the traveler in person or establishes a relationship over the phone. For a fee, they discuss the travel options they have researched.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese travel agencies began losing their monopoly on the industry during the late 1990s, when airlines began to sell tickets online and travel giants like Expedia.com exploded onto the scene, quickly gobbling market share by introducing the quick, do-it- yourself model.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1995, there were 37,000 brick-and-mortar travel agencies, according to the American Society of Travel Agents. Now, only 18,000 exist after many merged or folded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the Internet has done is given us a nation that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing,\" said Bill Maloney, CEO of the American Society of Travel Agents. \"How do you know if a hotel is actually a good value or if it's overpriced? You have these online generalists and these individual specialists.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel agent Nancy Cutter of Court Travel Ltd. in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a half-dozen other agencies across the country say they have experienced a surge in returning clients, who said travel Web sites were confusing and unhelpful.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn several instances, brick-and-mortar agents say they were able to offer deals at the same price as, and even undercut, the travel agent models, dispelling the belief that the cheapest rate is online.\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel agents have deals with suppliers that can sometimes enable them to offer lower prices than on the Web. They also have time to cancel tickets for free, compared with some non-refundable tickets sold on the Web. Expedia.com said it recently waived the fee for travelers changing certain flights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just because you can go out and buy Turbo Tax doesn't mean it's the best answer for everyone,\" Cutter said. \"Some people will still go to an accountant. Booking travel can get complicated, and it's just not as easy as it looks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel agents don't discount the value of online travel agencies, which can be useful for booking simple, short trips, but they say complex itineraries require more expertise from a professional. Many online travel companies agree that an agent may be valuable in planning a detailed honeymoon that includes a tour of vineyards in France or a family excursion to top snorkeling and kangaroo-watching destinations in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're the type of traveler who needs hand-holding up front, then sure, a travel agent would be great, but you can usually find that same information on the Web,\" said Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline.com, a travel company famous for letting bidders set their own price. He said the agents available by phone at his company can help facilitate a sale and customize cruises for travelers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline travel companies say they have made functionality improvements on their sites in recent years. For example, Expedia.com, the world's largest online travel agency, offers a tool that can let customers compare seats on an airplane, with ratings on how comfortable a seat is and how much leg room is available. They also have hotel reviews and even Web tours of rooms to help travelers decide.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, research shows that online travel model is poised to grow. Even in a recession, when companies and individuals are scaling back on travel, Expedia.com saw a 22 percent air transaction growth rate in the last quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Susan D. Tanzman of Martin's Travel and Tours in California, who has worked as an agent for 35 years, points out that agents follow up with travelers before and after the trip. If the traveler needs help, the agency can offer assistance. They often work 24 hours a day.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoAnne Kochneff, owner of midsize agency Travel by Gagnon in Michigan, said agents can give the personal attention a site cannot. Kochneff's office provides a homey feel, with agents offering freshly baked cookies for clients who stop by to chat about their trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have personal experience traveling in the area, so they can give you a personal recommendation,\" said Frances Mosser, 67, of Kentucky, on her reason why she switched to the travel agent model this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nMosser and her husband booked a trip to St. Melo in France with a travel agent. The agent helped them devise a way to reduce travel time by taking Ryan Air between countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think we could have planned the trip without her,\" Mosser said.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- An Idaho man accused of trying to assassinate President Barack Obama by shooting at the White House pleaded not guilty, as expected, in federal court Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOscar Ortega-Hernandez will remain in custody until his trial, a date for which has not yet been scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appeared in a dark blue prison jumpsuit at his brief arraignment hearing before Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson. He was indicted last week on 17 criminal counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors say Ortega-Hernandez fired a Romanian-made assault rifle out of the window of his car the evening of November 11. After allegedly sending a number of rounds toward the White House, he sped away toward a bridge leading to the Virginia suburbs, but crashed his vehicle and fled on foot, officials say.\n\n\n\n\n\nA court document says Ortega-Hernandez's fingerprints were found on ammunition magazines left in a 1998 Honda, but not on the weapon itself, which also was left in the car.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither the president nor his family was at home at the time of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrtega-Hernandez said nothing at Tuesday's hearing, but appeared alert, nodding and smiling at the judge as the hearing concluded. He wore a heavy beard and was not in restraints.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn FBI agent had testified at an earlier hearing that bullets found embedded in the White House residence came from Ortega-Hernandez's assault weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old man claimed after his arrest that he had been car-jacked by a man with a gun on the day of the crime, and said his assailant must have been responsible for the shooting, according to court filings. He also allegedly told the officers he never owned a gun, but the government cited two witnesses from Idaho confirming the rifle left in the car belonged to Ortega-Hernandez.\n\n\n\n\n\nA federal public defender representing Ortega-Hernandez had previously claimed inconsistent witness statements raised doubts about whether he was the shooter. Attorney David Bos cited one witness who said the shooter was driving a yellow van. Police had said Ortega-Hernandez was driving a dark-colored sedan.\n\n\n\n\n\nBos did not object Tuesday when the magistrate ruled the defendant would continue to be held behind bars. Another hearing is scheduled for next month.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrtega-Hernandez was captured at a Pennsylvania motel days after the incident. He told police he hitchhiked and walked from the District of Columbia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother federal judge previously ruled him competent to stand trial. Ortega-Hernandez has been interviewed at least once by a psychologist, and the doctor said he is able to understand the allegations against him and to aid in his defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors argue Ortega-Hernandez is dangerous and planned out his alleged crime over a period of months.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf convicted of attempting to assassinate the president, Ortega-Hernandez would face a maximum sentence of life in prison.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Billy Ray Cyrus may be a country boy at heart, but he is also pretty savvy when it comes to navigating Hollywood.\n\n\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus has a full plate with acting, touring, composing and being a dad.\n\n\n\nWhen others wrote him off as a novelty act after the 1992 hit \"Achy Breaky Heart,\" Cyrus kept making music and eventually turned to acting.\n\n\n\nIt was a decision he said came after some well-timed fatherly advice.\n\n\n\n\"In the mid-'90s, my dad said to me 'Son, you've got all of your eggs in one basket and you are living and dying by music,' \" Cyrus recalled. \"He said 'I want you to have a career like Kenny Rogers.' \"\n\n\n\nCyrus said his dad suggested he branch out into acting. Cyrus eventually auditioned for and won a role in what appeared to be an unlikely vehicle -- David Lynch's 2001 film \"Mulholland Drive.\"\n\n\n\nAfter Lynch, known for such works as \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Twin Peaks,\" suggested that Cyrus should continue to pursue the craft, he went on to star in the television drama \"Doc,\" which also helped spur the career of Cyrus' greatest production -- \"Hannah Montana\" star, and Cyrus' daughter, Miley Cyrus.\n\n\n\nNow, with the release of \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" on Blu-ray and DVD, a music tour and an upcoming role in a film featuring comedian George Lopez and martial arts expert Jackie Chan, Cyrus is staying busy.\n\n\n\nHe recently took some time out of his hectic schedule to talk to CNN about how he keeps it all together, how he manages raising a family full of performers (son Trace is a member of the band Metro Station, daughter Brandi performs with the band Frank and Derol and also acts, as do younger children Braison and Noah) and what makes him a good fit for Hollywood.\n\n\n\nCNN: What do you like about \"Hannah Montana: The Movie?\"\n\n\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus: I think it's got a certain amount of realism to it with art imitating life imitating art. It certainly parallels a lot of things in mine and Miley's real world and real lives.\n\n\n\nI wrote the song \"Back to Tennessee\" and as I read the script for the movie, \"Back to Tennessee\" became a cornerstone of the film and the title track off the album. The realism of the film translates into the music, and I think vice versa.\n\n\n\nCNN: The film speaks to never losing touch with your roots. How important is that to you?\n\n\n\nCyrus: Extremely. My dad told me as a kid to always be aware of where you are, always have a vision for your future, but never forget where you came from.\n\n\n\nCNN: You've had careers in both music and acting. Do you still feel a bit like a fish out of water dealing with Hollywood?\n\n\n\nCyrus: I love Hollywood as far as being an actor. Getting to work with Jackie Chan and George Lopez in this new film we have coming out in January [\"The Spy Next Door\"], working with Heather Locklear and Patricia Neal in the Lifetime movie \"Flying By\" and Brooke Shields, who has appeared as my deceased wife on \"Hannah Montana.\"\n\n\n\nI look back at it now and think that I may fit in more to the film community than I do Nashville, to tell you the truth. I love what I do.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you have a preference, then, for acting over music?\n\n\n\nCyrus: My preference is to find projects that can combine the two. I also love to write scores. I wrote a lot of the scores for \"Doc\" and I love to write scores for other projects.\n\n\n\nCNN: How do you balance being a star with being a dad?\n\n\n\nCyrus: The very best I can. I just take it one step at a time and do the best I can.\n\n\n\nMy dad was to me what I try to be to Miley, which is somewhat of a best friend. I try my best to be a good daddy and if she wants to talk about business or music I try my best to be a good manager. I try to be all of those things because that's what my dad was to me.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, my dad passed away four years ago from mesothelioma, but I feel like in some ways my dad is looking down on me and smiling.\n\n\n\nHis name was Ronald Ray Cyrus and a lot of people say Miley changed her name to Miley Ray because of Billy Ray, but that's not true. She did that in honor of my dad, because the two of them just loved each other to pieces.\n\n\n\nCNN: So will Miley ever remake \"Achy Breaky Heart\"?\n\n\n\nCyrus: I doubt it, but anything is a possibility. In 1991 I recorded \"Achy Breaky Heart\" and we are not too terribly far away from the 20-year anniversary, and there are some major stars who want to re-do that song.\n\n\n\nI'm flirting with the idea. There's one cat in particular that if I told you who it was, it would blow your mind. But I've got to keep it under my hat right now.",

Mike Ross, D-Arkansas, is a leading negotiator for the Blue Dog Democrats on health care.\n\n\n\n\"We remain opposed to the current bill, and we continue to meet several times a day to decide how we're going to proceed and what amendments we will be offering as Blue Dogs on the committees,\" said Rep.

Their letter to leaders raised concerns about new mandates on small businesses. Blue Dogs also say the bill fails to fix the inequities in the current system for health care costs for rural doctors and hospitals.\n\n\n\nThe Energy and Commerce committee, along with two other House committees, is scheduled to take up the bill Thursday.\n\n\n\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans 36-23 on the Energy and Commerce committee, which contains eight Blue Dogs, including Ross. If seven Democrats vote with Republicans against the bill, it would fail to advance to the House floor.\n\n\n\nAsked whether the Blue Dogs on Energy and Commerce are considering voting as a group against the bill if it remains unchanged, Ross replied, \"absolutely.\"\n\n\n\nHe didn't give details on changes the Blue Dogs want. But he did say he wasn't satisfied with the penalty exemption for small businesses that don't provide health insurance for employees. An earlier draft of the Democrats' bill exempted businesses from paying a penalty if their payrolls were less than $100,000. Democratic leaders raised that payroll amount to $250,000.",

The allied pilots flew in millions of tons of food, fuel and medication for an ailing population, earning themselves the title \"candy bombers,\" for dropping candy as they flew over the city.\n\n\n\n\"Through Tempelhof, we stayed alive,\" said Hedi Koenig, 83, who lived near the airport in West Berlin after the war. Without the air drops, she said, the people would have starved to death.\n\n\n\nThe airport rapidly became Berlin's only hub for supplies, eventually carrying almost 2.5 million tons of goods into the city.\n\n\n\nTempelhof's massive main building -- originally designed to represent Nazi Germany to visitors -- remains one of the largest structures in the world. The U.S. Army later built a basketball court and firing range at Tempelhof, and hid an entire command center in the vast network of tunnels under the buildings.\n\n\n\nThese days, however, its runways are too short for most modern civilian aircraft. City officials said the airport was not profitable and needed to be shut down as Berlin builds a major new airport, Berlin-Brandenburg International.\n\n\n\nMoves to close Tempelhof have sparked protests from residents and aviators who thought more should have been done to preserve such an important part of the city's history. See archive photos of the airport\n\n\n\n\"The people want it, private enterprise wants it, all national arguments are in favor of it,\" Friedbert Pflueger, a local opposition leader, said last year.\n\n\n\nMore than 100 private pilots staged a \"fly-in\" in September 2007 to protest the plans.\n\n\n\nKoenig said Berliners were still angry with city officials who allowed the closure. She blamed business leaders for putting pressure on the city to close the airport by arguing it cost too much and didn't make enough money.\n\n\n\n\"For business people, the airport doesn't mean anything,\" said Koenig. She said they were too young to remember how important Tempelhof has been for the city.\n\n\n\nKoenig is among many who believe the airport should be turned into a cultural memorial.\n\n\n\nA memorial already exists outside the airport to remember the candy bombers, dozens of whom died flying in during bad weather or after being harassed by Soviet fighter planes.\n\n\n\n\"The success of the airlift made sure that the communist ideology lost its impetus, lost its thrust, because people began to realize that democracies can defend their way of life,\" said Helmut Trotnow of the Berlin Allied Museum.\n\n\n\nThe allied pilots, Koenig said, were responsible for saving the city amid the Russian blockade.\n\n\n\n\"The Russians tried with all their might to break us,\" she said.\n\n\n\nKoenig snuck into West Berlin from the East after the war. That meant she didn't have a visa and couldn't receive official food rations, so she literally scraped by during her night job at a bakery.\n\n\n\nKoenig said she cleaned the pans and would try to scratch off whatever food remained stuck to the sides. Her boss would check to make sure she wasn't eating any of the remnants, but Koenig said she did it anyway, whenever her boss wasn't looking.\n\n\n\nTempelhof's beginnings date to September 4, 1909, when American aviation pioneer Orville Wright flew an engine-powered plane for a few minutes on the airfield there. It ushered in the era of aviation in Germany, and Tempelhof eventually became Berlin's central airport and the biggest hub in Europe.\n\n\n\nThe airport also became the home of Lufthansa, which was founded in Berlin in 1926.\n\n\n\nCivilian traffic declined during the second world war and the Soviet Army occupied the airport. The Americans took it over in July 1945.\n\n\n\nThe Soviet blockade of West Berlin began in May 1948 as an attempt to force the Western Allied powers out of that part of the city. They cut off rail and road links to the West, and West Berlin -- isolated in the middle of the new East Germany -- found itself isolated even more.\n\n\n\nIn response, the Allies imposed counter-blockade measures which included cutting off East German communications and an embargo on Eastern bloc exports. The moves forced the Soviet Union to eventually lift the blockade a year later, in May 1949.\n\n\n\nThe last flights from Tempelhof will fly just before midnight Thursday, the airport authority said. One will be a special Lufthansa flight aboard a Junkers Ju-52, a post-World War II transport aircraft. The other will be a DC-3 -- the same type of plane flown by the candy bombers from Tempelhof some 60 years ago.\n\n\n\nWith the closing of Tempelhof, the city has two remaining airports -- at Schoenefeld and Tegel. All flights from Tempelhof will move to Tegel.\n\n\n\nEventually, Schoenefeld will become the new Berlin-Brandenburg International, or BBI. It is scheduled to open in 2011, after which Tegel will close.\n\n\n\nCNN Berlin Bureau Chief Fred Pleitgen and CNN's Carolin Fiehm in London contributed to this report.",

  "context": "London, England (CNN) -- Britain's top legal official \"misled\" the government over the case for war in Iraq under pressure from then prime minister Tony Blair, a former Cabinet minister claimed Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nClare Short, who was Blair's international development secretary until she quit over the Iraq invasion, said Attorney General Peter Goldsmith withheld his own \"doubts and changes of opinion\" in giving the go-ahead for war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think he misled the Cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through,\" Short told an inquiry into Britain's role in the March 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry -- Britain's fifth examination of its Iraq involvement -- has already grilled senior figures including Blair, former defense minister Geoff Hoon and Britain's top military commander Jock Stirrup.\n\n\n\n\n\nShort said that Goldsmith, who last week testified before the inquiry that he was initially ambivalent but later adamant over the legality of the war, was wrong to press the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldsmith initially advised Blair in January 2003 that it would be unlawful to invade Iraq without a United Nations Security Council resolution but changed his mind a month later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go to war was misleading.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShort said Goldsmith was \"leaned on\" by Blair to agree to the war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lord Goldsmith said he was excluded from lots of meetings -- that's a form of pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was suggested to him that he go to the U.S. to get advice about the legal position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have got the Bush administration who have very low respect for international law. It seems the most extraordinary place in the world to go to get advice about international law.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe added: \"I think all that was leaning on -- sending him to America, excluding him and then including him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer comments came just days after Blair appearance at the inquiry generated protests, with several hundred anti-war campaigners gathering outside the London venue chanting \"Blair lied, thousands died\" and other slogans.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair denied claims he had struck a secret deal with U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002 pledging British backing for the invasion and said he believed \"beyond doubt\" his unfounded pre-war claim that Iraq was capable of launching chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair: No 'covert' deal with Bush over Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts say involvement in the Iraq war remains a \"live political issue\" in the UK, because the same government -- now led by Gordon Brown -- was still power, whereas the parties of other leaders in the U.S. and Australia have been voted out of office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The others have faced critical public scrutiny and been damaged by that,\" legal expert Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN. \"The British haven't had a change of administration so in many ways it remains a live political issue because it reflects on people who are in government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Simon Hooper contributed to this report",

We have seen wickets fall early on all the days so far. We have definitely got to attack early,\" the former Zimbabwe international player said.\n\n\n\n\"The first two days produced very difficult batting conditions, today was easier. We don't know what sort of conditions are going to arrive tomorrow. If it plays as easy as it has today, we have got a chance.\"",

Arlen Specter held a town hall meeting with Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary. In attempting to answer questions, they were shouted down by folks more interested in venting than discussing.\n\n\n\nOn the conservative FreedomWorks Web site, the display was headlined \"Specter Gets Schooled.\" Above the video of the event, the site says \"... this is a must watch and a must emulate at town halls across the country over the next month.\"\n\n\n\nReally?\n\n\n\nWhat about those folks who are actually interested in debating and discussing a very complex issue they're trying to digest? There are some who may actually want to figure out the best way to solve the health care problem.\n\n\n\nWhat ever happened to asking questions about the quality of care, the cost of insurance, the impact of any public plan on the health care system? After all, this has been a turbulent economic time for this country, and another huge shock to the system is naturally worrisome.\n\n\n\nEspecially when it comes to an issue as complex as health care.\n\n\n\nBut it's not just the folks at these town halls who have learned how to heckle. Their bad behavior is a derivative of the questionable quality of the political debate they listen to every day. Indeed, if there's one thing we've gotten really good at over the years, it's this: reducing complicated problems to bite-sized slogans. It seems to work, so we keep doing it.\n\n\n\nIpso facto, Obama's reform ideas become \"socialism\" to his Republican critics. And the administration is not above creating a handy bogeyman of its own: the insurance companies. At least according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who accuses them of \"full-force carpet-bombing and shock and awe against the public option.\" Too bad they actually support the rest of reform, and are still running positive ads about the effort.\n\n\n\nThey weren't at the table at all 16 years ago when Hillary Clinton's effort at reform failed. The world has changed since then, and the congressional plans for reforming health care have changed, too. But the invective of the debate, sad to say, has not.\n\n\n\nThe effort on Capitol Hill has been serious. I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but members of Congress are actually doing some real work. Some policy differences may never get resolved because they are too ideological; others are regional, and that's tough, too. But they're working at it, for hours on end, behind closed doors. No cameras, no grandstanding.\n\n\n\nOne of those working the hardest, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, was derided at a town hall recently on the matter of his own health insurance. So here's the fellow who is spending every waking hour trying to get a bipartisan measure that can pass the Senate -- and be fair to Iowans -- and he goes home and gets an earful.\n\n\n\nMaybe the discourse will become more productive as the summer progresses. And maybe not. But the health care dilemma remains, no matter how loud the discussion. As John F. Kennedy told us, \"To govern is to choose.\" Especially when the choices are not easy.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.",

  "context": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan electoral officials Monday declared incumbent President Hamid Karzai the winner of another term in office, after canceling this weekend's second round of voting.\n\n\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama called Monday for a \"new chapter\" of improved governance in Afghanistan now that Karzai's re-election as president is complete.\n\n\n\nObservers say Karzai's real test will be whether he can form a government that is seen as legitimate in the eyes of the Afghan people and the international community.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission announced Karzai's victory Monday after it canceled Saturday's presidential runoff because of the withdrawal of candidate Abdullah Abdullah.\n\n\n\nA runoff could have been held with just one candidate, but commission president Azizullah Lodin said electoral officials decided to cancel the second round of voting for several reasons, including security and money. The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement, according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai.\n\n\n\nAfghans went to the polls on August 20, in a vote marred by widespread fraud. Karzai had initially claimed victory, but two months after the vote, a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes, citing fraud. That left Karzai short of a majority, and he eventually agreed to the runoff.\n\n\n\nAbdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. He argued that the commissioners, who are hired by Karzai, cannot be impartial.\n\n\n\nBut that request was not met, Abdullah said Sunday, and he did not believe a transparent election was possible.\n\n\n\n\"I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people,\" Abdullah told reporters.\n\n\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Kabul on Monday hours before the commission's announcement. He issued a statement welcoming the decision, congratulating Karzai, and restating the U.N.'s commitment to supporting the new government.\n\n\n\n\"This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan and lessons must be learned,\" Ban said in the statement. \"Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community.\"\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Ban met with both Karzai and Abdullah, as well as U.N. officials, including Kai Eide, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul also issued a statement Monday welcoming the commission's decision and congratulating Karzai.\n\n\n\nIn Washington, President Barack Obama told reporters in the White House that he had congratulated Karzai in a telephone conversation.\n\n\n\n\"Although the process was messy, I'm pleased to say that the final outcome was determined in accordance with Afghan law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he told Karzai \"that this has to be a point in time in which we begin to write a new chapter based on improved governance, a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption, joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces so that the Afghan people can provide for their own security.\"\n\n\n\nObama added that Karzai assured him he understands the importance of the moment, \"but as I indicated to him, the proof is not going to be in words, it's going to be in deeds.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the resolved election issue, Gibbs refused to put a firm timetable on when Obama would announce whether he would increase troop levels Afghanistan. Instead, Gibbs repeated past language that the decision would be made within weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Now begin the hard conversations about ensuring credibility and ensuring improving governance, addressing corruption\" in Afghanistan, Gibbs said.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican defeated by Obama in last year's presidential race, said Monday that Karzai's re-election should encourage Obama to fulfill Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for up to 40,000 more troops.\n\n\n\n\"The most urgent priority now is to support our Afghan partners in reversing what General McChrystal has rightly called the 'deteriorating' security situation,\" McCain said in a statement. \"This requires a properly-resourced counterinsurgency strategy, and I urge President Obama to provide our civilian and military leaders with the resources they need to succeed.\"\n\n\n\nThe cancellation of the runoff \"puts the election issue behind us,\" but Karzai has yet to achieve a true victory, according to the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\n\n\n\"Now the key issue is how the Afghan people will react to this, what kind of government will President Karzai put together, and how the international community will react,\" Khalilzad said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"We're in a new stage now in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nKhalilzad had predicted last week that Abdullah would quit the race, in an interview for CNN's \"Amanpour.\"\n\n\n\n\"First, he doesn't have much money left,\" he said in the interview, which aired Sunday. \"Second, I think that he thinks that given the situation, he's likely to lose, and maybe he'll get less votes than he did in the first round, so that would be embarrassing.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking to CNN following his withdrawal, Abdullah said his decision does not mean he has given up public life.\n\n\n\n\"I will be available to serve this country,\" he said. \"At this stage, I am in consultation with my followers, with my supporters and a movement for change will be there and I will lead that movement. There is no doubt about it.\"\n\n\n\nKarzai served as acting president following the U.S. ouster of Taliban rulers in 2001, then secured a victory in the 2004 elections. He begins his second term in office amid a resurgence of the Taliban.\n\n\n\nThe militants claimed responsibility for a Wednesday attack that killed five United Nations workers -- two of whom were helping with the vote. Nine others were wounded in the attack, on a guest house in Kabul. In response, the United Nations ordered nonessential personnel out of the country.\n\n\n\nInternational troop levels increased this year to provide security for the Afghan election in August.\n\n\n\nAttacks against U.S. and NATO forces have also spiked: 59 American troops died in Afghanistan in October, the highest U.S. monthly toll since the war began eight years ago.\n\n\n\nCNN's Jonathan Wald in Kabul, Afghanistan contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Editor's note: Zeyno Baran, a native of Turkey, is senior fellow for the Center for Islam, Democracy and the Future of the Muslim World at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank that says it is dedicated to \"global security, prosperity and freedom.\" From January 2003 until 2006, Baran directed the International Security and Energy Programs at The Nixon Center.\n\n\n\nZeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start.\n\n\n\nHis address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy.\n\n\n\nThat said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward.\n\n\n\nDespite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral.\n\n\n\nWith Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help?\n\n\n\nTurkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together.\n\n\n\nReading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women.\n\n\n\nNo matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences.\n\n\n\nInstead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing.\n\n\n\nIndeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies.\n\n\n\nThere are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions.\n\n\n\nStill, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States.\n\n\n\nTo start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the \"Muslim world\" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea.\n\n\n\nTurkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices.\n\n\n\nAnything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeyno Baran.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Toney Dixon's fascination with dead bodies goes back to her childhood, when she would sneak around her uncle's funeral home and watch him prepare bodies.\n\n\n\nThe bodies on display are plastinated, a process that replaces bodily fluids and fat with plastic.\n\n\n\n\"I found my heart racing,\" said Dixon, 67. \"But instead of being taken aback and terrified, I wanted to know more.\"\n\n\n\nYears later, Dixon's curiosity drew her and her twin sister, Erlyene Toney-Alvarez, to Body Worlds, an exhibit that shows preserved human specimens bisected and stripped of skin.\n\n\n\n\"It's like standing in the mirror and seeing yourself in a totally new way,\" said Dixon, the younger twin.\n\n\n\nThe twins were so impressed that they signed up on the spot to donate their earthly remains to the exhibit, which is currently showing in the United States, Canada, England and Germany.\n\n\n\nWith their signatures, the women joined a group of people who believe that having their bodies dissected, preserved and displayed will serve a greater purpose than burial or cremation. Body Worlds' donor program boasts about 800 people in North America and 8,600 worldwide.\n\n\n\n\"I thought, since I like to think outside the box, this would be a really good way to preserve our bodies instead of the typical funeral,\" Toney-Alvarez said. \"It's also something I can go to my death feeling good about, like I made a contribution to humankind.\"\n\n\n\nIndividual Americans have had the right to bequeath their bodies to science since 1965, when the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act established the human body as property. With that law, a donor's wishes superseded those of the next of kin.\n\n\n\nBut academics in the field of gross anatomy attribute recent increases in body donations to relaxed social mores, according to an article published by the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, medical schools have been the most common recipients of willed specimens in America. Then, in 1993, controversial German anatomist Gunther von Hagens emerged with an alternative.\n\n\n\nVon Hagens, a self-styled iconoclast who earned the moniker Dr. Frankenstein in Europe for performing a public dissection, invented plastination in the 1970s.  See photos of the Body Worlds exhibit \u00bb\n\n\n\nHe spent the next few years popularizing and refining the process, which replaces bodily fluids and fat with plastic, earning equal shares of admiration and infamy.\n\n\n\nIn 1993, von Hagens founded the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany, a research center that performs plastination and manages the Body Worlds exhibits.\n\n\n\nThe Institute produces specimens for Body Worlds exhibits and academic institutions that pay anywhere from $200 to $60,000 for them.\n\n\n\nVon Hagens says he relies on donors not only as a source of specimens, but also as representations of Body Worlds' philosophy.\n\n\n\n\"I feel it is in line with democratic principles that you can decide in your lifetime whether to go to the cemetery or put yourself on display in an exhibition to teach the next generation,\" von Hagens said in a recent telephone interview.\n\n\n\nVon Hagens says the Body Worlds donor program distinguishes it from similar exhibitions that have used bodies of questionable origin.\n\n\n\nIn a settlement with the New York State Attorney General's Office, Premier Exhibitions admitted that the specimens used in \"Bodies ... The Exhibit\" might be victims of torture or execution from Chinese prisons.\n\n\n\nThe settlement requires that Premier Exhibitions obtain proof of donor consent for specimens used in its shows. The company has also set up a fund to compensate visitors to its New York show.\n\n\n\nLegislation is pending in several states that would require shows like Body Worlds to prove donor consent before they open.\n\n\n\nVon Hagens has weathered similar allegations over the years. He insists that the specimens in Body Worlds exhibits come from donors.\n\n\n\nHe has done some plastination work on bodies from China at the request of medical schools and universities, but these bodies were not put on display.\n\n\n\n\"It is very, very important for the donors to know the purpose of the exhibit, that it is not entertainment, it is education and enlightenment,\" von Hagens said. \"I have to be in peace with those on display.\"\n\n\n\nThe donors meet periodically at conferences, where they catch up with each other and with von Hagens. Recently, the sisters attended a donor conference in Los Angeles, California, with their mother, Irma Henry, who signed on in 1997.\n\n\n\nMarc Rohner donated his leg to Body Worlds because he wanted others to learn from it.\n\n\n\n\"What you see in a picture or on \"CSI\" does not do justice to what the real human body looks like or how it functions,\" said Rohner, whose leg was amputated in 2006 to remove a malignant giant cell tumor. \"By having a three-dimensional leg or black lung in front of you, you have areas of focus and details you can't see in a photo.\"\n\n\n\nWith his donation, Rohner, a pathologist's assistant in Columbus, Ohio, became the first living person to give a body part to the Institute.\n\n\n\nRohner acknowledges that the exhibits are not for everyone. Church groups in Europe have repeatedly denounced the shows as disrespectful, and skeptics around the world continue to question whether the Body Worlds specimens really are from legitimate sources.\n\n\n\nBut Toney-Alvarez says she will visit Body Worlds, even if her mother and sister are on display.\n\n\n\n\"Once you have passed on, it's just a shell. The memories are in the heart and in the mind,\" she said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- We all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control: Commutes back up, smog thickens, and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces.\n\n\n\nThe oceans are growing crowded, and governments are increasingly trying to plan their use.\n\n\n\nBut what about \"ocean sprawl\"?\n\n\n\nUntil recently, no one gave that idea much thought. But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\"The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,\" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. \"Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world.\"\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies.\n\n\n\nA handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems.\n\n\n\nInternationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\n\n\n\nOcean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming.\n\n\n\nOne reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group.\n\n\n\n\"The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,\" Whitehouse said. \"So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface.\"\n\n\n\nBeneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century.\n\n\n\nThe energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space.\n\n\n\nIn Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nWhat happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, pavement on land creates \"expressways\" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. \"Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,\" the report says.\n\n\n\nWhen the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,\" she said, \"but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans.\"\n\n\n\nSince there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. He added, \"There's not enough space for everything, and there are going to have to be trade-offs that are made.\"\n\n\n\nCurrent efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts, Ehler said.\n\n\n\nUntil now, the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of \"free-for-all\" in which \"whoever gets there first gets the access,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLeland, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the United States contributes to the problem.\n\n\n\nMore than 140 federal laws govern the ocean's use; and six federal departments, along with dozens of agencies, are in charge of implementing those laws, according to the Pew Oceans Commission report.\n\n\n\nCharles M. Wahle, a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Obama's ocean-planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking.\n\n\n\n\"We're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways,\" he said. \"They all have standing, and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"Fifty years from now, you should be able to go to a place [in the ocean] and know what will be happening there.\"\n\n\n\nThere are skeptics of the shift.\n\n\n\nCommercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups, said Jim Ruhle, president of Commercial Fishermen of America, an industry group.\n\n\n\n\"We make our livelihoods from that ocean, and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSome other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses, like offshore wind energy, entirely.\n\n\n\nDespite this new emphasis on planning, there's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities.\n\n\n\n\"The proof will be in the pudding,\" said Wahle, of NOAA.\n\n\n\nBut he said it's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking.\n\n\n\n\"If we do our jobs right, overall, the oceans will be healthier, ecosystems will be more productive, people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems,\" he said, \"and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work.\"",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In her first television interview since Mel Gibson went public with their relationship in April, his girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, made it clear to CNN: \"I'd like to be known for my music.\"\n\n\n\nOksana Grigorieva and Mel Gibson are expecting a child this year.\n\n\n\nStill, the 39-year-old singer was willing to talk about her beau and her pregnancy, as well as her new album, \"Beautiful Heartache.\"\n\n\n\n\"Beautiful Heartache\" was released to iTunes on July 23 by Icon Distribution, Gibson's company, which up until now has handled only soundtracks for his movies.\n\n\n\n\"He's an incredible artist,\" Grigorieva said. \"A visionary. He enabled me to produce this album, for my music to live.\"\n\n\n\nThe Oscar-winning (\"Braveheart\") filmmaker also directed four music videos for Grigorieva during a whirlwind week in Mexico.  Watch Grigorieva talk about Gibson, love \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"They're like dramatic miniature films -- a whirlpool of different, exciting, bright images. That's quite rare,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe music videos and music are available on her Web site, www.oksana.fm.\n\n\n\nGrigorieva has a background in music. She said she was classically trained as a pianist in her native Russia, and both her parents are musicians. In 2006, a song she penned called \"Un Dia Llegara\" was recorded by Josh Groban for his album \"Awake.\"\n\n\n\nThough she describes her album as being about \"different facets of love,\" she cautions that listeners shouldn't overthink the lyrics. \"This album is not autobiographical -- maybe only partially so. It's not a diary.\"\n\n\n\nGibson, 53, and his wife of nearly 30 years, Robyn, filed for divorce in April. The two have seven children.\n\n\n\nGrigorieva and Gibson were first photographed together on the set of his movie \"Edge of Darkness,\" according to People magazine. Grigorieva is pregnant with Gibson's child and is to give birth this year.\n\n\n\nShe said the couple has opted not to learn the sex of the child. It will be her second child, after Alexander, her 12-year-old son with actor Timothy Dalton.\n\n\n\n\"I'm already buying things in gender-neutral colors. It's very cute,\" she chuckled. Alexander, she added, is excited about having a sibling. \"He's like a little man, protecting me. He's looking forward to it very much.\"\n\n\n\nGrigorieva says she and Gibson have no immediate plans for marriage. \"We don't know yet. We haven't really talked about it,\" she admitted.\n\n\n\nShe acknowledged that her relationship with Gibson has given her a unique opportunity to present her skills.\n\n\n\n\"If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful,\" she said. \"You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all.\"\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Grigorieva is adapting to life in the public eye.\n\n\n\n\"It hasn't been too bad, actually. There was a period of time where it was a little bit difficult, but now it's much better,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBefore embarking on limited press for the new album, Gibson did offer a few words of advice, she added: \"Just be myself and speak the truth. What I most like to talk about is my music and 'Beautiful Heartache.' And that's pretty much it.\"",

  "context": "Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The parents of an injured baby girl who was flown to Florida for treatment after Haiti's earthquake have been told what they already know: They are the biological parents of the little girl.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Red Cross notified Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis in Haiti that DNA testing proves that the infant is theirs, said Mark LaPoint, an attorney representing the baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescuers dubbed her Patricia, but her parents call her Jenny.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman decided that Jenny's parents will get to take her back to Haiti after doctors and nurses in Florida finish treating her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a case where these were really good parents, and I can't wait for these parents to be reunited with their baby,\" the judge said. \"This is one happy day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal authorities have pledged to help Devilme and Alexis travel from Haiti to the United States to reunite with their daughter, though the timing of that trip has not yet been determined, said Bob Martinez, an attorney for the parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe baby still has a hard time closing her left hand and needs some medical therapy, LaPoint said in court Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge scheduled a hearing for April 7 to get an update on the baby's condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny was 4 months old when the January 12 earthquake destroyed large swaths of Haiti. Her mother was knocked unconscious in the 7.0-magnitude temblor and taken to a hospital. When she awoke, she urged her husband to go home to search for their baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexis searched through the broken rubble for four days, but found nothing. The couple says that on the fifth day, January 16, witnesses saw a cleanup crew rescue Jenny from the rubble. She reportedly was found in the arms of her baby sitter, who was dead. The witnesses got word to Devilme, who was in the hospital with her own injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescuers apparently assumed the baby was an orphan and whisked her away to a different hospital in Port-au-Prince, one run by the University of Miami and Project Medishare, where a team of pediatricians worked desperately to keep her alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about the couple awaiting the baby's return\n\n\n\n\n\nWith several broken ribs, the baby was having trouble breathing. The doctors stabilized her, and a few hours after the baby's rescue, a United Nations truck took her to a plane that was minutes away from leaving for Miami, Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I told the ambulance driver if she got there in time, we'd name the baby after her,\" says Dr. Arthur Fournier, a University of Miami physician working at the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe driver, Patricia, did make it on time, and thereafter, doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami referred to the infant by that name.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevilme says the friend who told her of Jenny's rescue didn't know where the baby had been taken. By the time she found out , the baby had already been flown to Miami, Devilme says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevilme and Alexis say it was \"God's will\" that Jenny went to Miami, as she might not have survived if she'd stayed in Haiti.\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny was discharged from the hospital and is living in foster care in Florida. Her parents are living in a tent city in Port-au-Prince and recently had the DNA testing needed to prove the baby is theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DNA tests have taken more than a month because of logistical difficulties getting the test to Haiti and because of a legal dispute over whether the baby should become a ward of the state of Florida or a ward of the U.S. government, says Mark Riordan, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families.",

Boykin, 55, of Denham Springs, Louisiana were pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. They were both clerical workers in the construction office.\n\n\n\nThe suspect, identified as Richard Matthews, 53, of Slaughter, Louisiana, parked outside Grady Crawford Construction Co. shortly before 2 p.m. and entered a building, where he shot a female dispatcher, said Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Casey Rayborn Hicks.\n\n\n\nHicks said Matthews then went into a second company building and killed two people inside.\n\n\n\nMatthews left the second building to reload his weapon, Hicks said. He re-entered that building, shot at and missed a fourth person, Hicks said.\n\n\n\nFour people then wrestled Matthews to the ground. One of them, a foreman at the construction company, put his finger between Matthews' finger and the trigger guard of Matthews' gun, stopping the gunman from shooting, Hicks said.\n\n\n\nThe four people held Matthews down until police arrived.\n\n\n\nMatthews was transported to the sheriff's office in downtown Baton Rouge, Hicks said, and was being questioned.\n\n\n\nHicks said police are uncertain if Matthews has prior arrests, mental health or substance abuse issues.\n\n\n\nMatthews will be booked on two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Hicks said.\n\n\n\nAs he was escorted in for questioning, in response to a reporter's question about the shooting, the Matthews replied numerous times: \"I couldn't get my unemployment, they wouldn't give me my unemployment.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(Budget Travel) -- On your next trip, you could be checking into a wine cask, a salvaged 727 airplane, or a room where the furniture defies the law of gravity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe casks at the Hotel De Vrouwe Van Stavoren in the Netherlands once held the equivalent of 19,333 bottles of wine.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpside-down stay\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Berlin's Propeller Island City Lodge, each of the 30 rooms is weird in its own way. The artist-owner, Lars Stroschen, has seen to that. One room, the first built, is made to look like a brightly painted medieval town, with an ultra-mini golf course surrounding the castle bed. Another has furniture attached to the ceiling, another has coffins for beds, and still another has lion cages on stilts (the Web site claims that kids \"love to sleep\" in them). Then there's the Freedom Room, which resembles a prison, complete with a toilet next to the bed -- oh, that German humor! 011-49/30-891-90-16, propeller-island.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nA place to unwine'd\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they were owned by a Swiss ch\u00e2teau, the four enormous casks on the grounds of the Hotel De Vrouwe Van Stavoren in the Netherlands held the equivalent of 19,333 bottles of wine. Now, after some creative recycling, it's guests rather than booze that mellow out inside the casks. The richly worn and airtight oak barrels have two narrow beds, with a small sitting area outside. The grounds are quite close to tiny Stavoren's harbor, which was a major port in the Middle Ages. 011-31/51-46-81-202, hotel-vrouwevanstavoren.nl.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bad trip (with none of the consequences)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe daughter of Ho Chi Minh's number two masterminded the Hang Nga Guest House and Art Gallery, a complex that more than earns its local nickname, the Crazy House. This LSD nightmare's three main buildings are Gaudi-esque concrete treehouse-like growths that appear as if they flowed organically out of the ground. Inside, the walls seem to dissolve into the floor, and right angles are avoided entirely. Each guest room is built around a different animal theme: the Eagle Room has a big-beaked bird standing atop a huge egg, while another has arm-sized ants crawling up the wall. The animal theme continues outside -- a large giraffe statue on the property contains a teahouse, and human-size \"spider webs\" are set up here and there. 011-84/63-82-20-70. Budget Travel: Check out these unusual hotels\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a league of its own\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrophobics should stay far from Jules' Undersea Lodge, named for novelist Jules Verne of \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" fame. The 600-square-foot lodge, a former marine lab, is 21 feet underwater, close to the bottom of the mangrove-filled Emerald Lagoon, in Key Largo. You'll have to know how to scuba dive to reach your room, and guests without the mandatory certification must take a course at the hotel. Once you've reached the lodge, which sleeps up to six, you'll be close to angelfish, anemones, barracuda, oysters, and other creatures -- each room is equipped with a 42-inch window, so you don't need to be suited up to keep an eye on the neighborhood. 305/451-2353, jul.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrash in a jet plane\n\n\n\n\n\nNear a beach that's within Manuel Antonio National Park, the Hotel Costa Verde doesn't lack for great sights. But few are as amazing as its own 727 Fuselage Suite, a salvaged 1965 Boeing 727-100 that looks as if it's crashed into the Costa Rican jungle (it's actually mounted atop a 50-foot pillar and reached via a spiral staircase). The jet's interior was once able to hold up to 125 passengers, but there are few reminders left of its days in the service of South African Airways and Colombia's Avianca Airlines. The suite's two bedrooms, dining area, and sitting room are now covered over entirely in teak to match the surroundings. Guests can play \"spot the toucan\" on the small wood deck that sits on top of the right wing. 011-506/27-77-05-84 or 866/854-7958, costaverde.com/727.html.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour escape pod awaits\n\n\n\n\n\nColored bright-orange for easy visibility, the '70s-era escape pods that make up the Capsule Hotel once hung outside oil rigs, ready to be deployed in case of an evacuation. Recycled by self-proclaimed \"garbage architect\" Denis Oudendijk, the fleet of pods now rotates among different moorings in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. At the moment, two are in the western Dutch town of Vlissingen and another is in The Hague. For a kind of James Bond-meets-Barbarella twist, opt to book your pod with a disco ball and all the spy's movies on DVD. It's a super-kitschy nod to a similar pod's appearance in \"The Spy Who Loved Me.\" 011-31/641-76-55-60, capsulehotel.info.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the road again\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine how much ground you could cover if you took your bed with you. That's the idea behind Exploranter Overland Hotel, a converted 25-ton truck that's a true hotel on wheels in Brazil. An awning extends out from the truck's side to provide some al fresco shade at lunchtime. The \"kitchen\" comes tricked out with fridges, freezers, and a large convection oven -- on this trip, the restaurant comes with you too, and sometimes nearby cooks are brought in to give guests a taste of the local cuisine. Your luggage and sleeping quarters are towed behind you, in a trailer that sleeps up to 24. With so much flexibility, guests can see Brazil's back country, far from crowds and sometimes any other people at all. The tours, which last from three days up to three months or more, have included horseback riding, vineyard tours, bird watching, and rodeos. 011-55/11-99-38-00-58, exploranter.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere the penthouse is a trailer park\n\n\n\n\n\nCape Town, South Africa's sleek Grand Daddy hotel has a surprise on its roof: a fleet of seven Airstream trailers, six of which were imported from the U.S. The aluminum-clad \"rooms,\" which sleep two people, have been done in playful themes that incorporate icons like \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\" (a blonde wig and a bear suit are available for dress-up), and John Lennon and Yoko Ono (the room's white-on-white furnishings include an enormous bed, natch). If you don't want to stray as far from the trailers' original looks, there's the Pleasantville model, an Eisenhower-era fantasia with chintz, harvest-gold curtains, and flower-covered throw pillows. 011-27/21-424-7247, granddaddy.co.za.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTILL WEIRD! Meet the giraffes (from the 2008 edition)\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout sacrificing its estate-in-the-country dignity -- or all of it, anyway -- Giraffe Manor in Langata, Kenya, is arranged so that roaming giraffes can poke their heads into any open window or doorway with impunity and lather guests with their sticky, prehensile tongues. Your guesthouse is their guesthouse, so the silly creatures pop up everywhere, including over the breakfast table, in the lobby, and through the curtains of the five guest rooms for adults. 011-254/20-890-948, off-hours 011-254/20-891-078, giraffemanor.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the best travel deals and tips emailed to you FREE - CLICK HERE!",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British military investigators interviewed a woman who claimed to have met a man from another planet while she was walking her dog, newly released Ministry of Defence files have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woman said she had been approached by a man with a \"Scandinavian-type accent\" dressed in a flying suit-style outfit while out walking on a sports field near Norwich, eastern England, in 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe claimed to have been \"completely terrified\" during the 10-minute encounter. Running home, she said she had then seen a large glowing object rising vertically from behind some nearby trees.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woman called a local military base to report the encounter the following day. A cover note on the file of the incident describes it as \"one of our more unusual UFO reports.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident is just one of around 1,200 sightings recorded by investigators between 1987 and 1993, according to the files released by the National Archives on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn another occasion, military officials took the unusual step of briefing ministers about an unidentified flying object photographed in the sky over Scotland alongside an RAF fighter jet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWitnesses claimed to have seen the large diamond-shaped object hanging in the air for about 10 minutes before it ascended vertically at high speed. Fearing intense media interest, investigators also commissioned detailed drawings of the object.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe files also reveal that the Ministry of Defence abandoned plans to build a computer database of sightings out of fears of a public relations disaster should details of its existence ever be revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I personally doubt that the the MoD would lose much if we filed UFO reports in 'WPD' (the waste paper basket),\" one unnamed official wrote of the project.",

  "context": "BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- The fiery leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant movement assured Lebanon on Monday that his movement will cooperate in the country's political life.\n\n\n\nSupporters carry posters of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.\n\n\n\nHassan Nasrallah said: \"We don't want to have control over Lebanon, or to have governance over Lebanon or to impose our ideas over the people of Lebanon, because we believe Lebanon to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone.\"\n\n\n\nNasrallah spoke a day after Lebanon's parliament elected Michel Sleiman the country's president after a six-month vacancy in the position.\n\n\n\nNasrallah, speaking at a packed stadium, told his followers: \"I renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions. The national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government. It is the victory of all Lebanese.\"\n\n\n\nHe said Sleiman's election \"renews the hope amongst the Lebanese people to a new era and a new start.\"\n\n\n\n\"I must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs, we are both in front of two choices; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of Lebanon and we prefer the second choice.\"\n\n\n\nThe parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president, but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new Cabinet.\n\n\n\nLebanon's Western-backed government and the Hezbollah-led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18-month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war, and paved the way for Sleiman's election.\n\n\n\nThe agreement, reached in Doha, Qatar, calls for a consensus government in which the Cabinet would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority, 11 for the Hezbollah-led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate.\n\n\n\nThe seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition, which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions. With 11 Cabinet posts, it will have that power.\n\n\n\nIn exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year's elections, Hezbollah agreed to end its sit-in protest that has paralyzed downtown Beirut since late 2006.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Sleiman expressed gratitude to Qatar and to the Arab League for helping broker the deal.\n\n\n\nSleiman was the consensus candidate, and is viewed as a neutral party by Lebanon's political factions. The nation's previous presidents have been seen as either pro-Syrian or pro-Western. In his 10 years as chief of the army, Sleiman also is believed to have unified the splintered military.\n\n\n\nHowever, he inherits a nation grappling with divisions. Lebanon's elected, pro-Western government has long been locked in a power struggle with Hezbollah.\n\n\n\nIn public statements and demonstrations in recent years, Hezbollah threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the Sunni-led government, triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region.\n\n\n\nThe election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month. That crisis was defused when the Lebanese government gave in to two key Hezbollah demands -- lifting a government ban of Hezbollah's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at Beirut's airport.\n\n\n\n\"The performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup, but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions,\" Nasrallah said.\n\n\n\n\"I promise that the opposition's representation in the government will not be monopolized by Hezbollah, Amal and the Change and Reform bloc. We will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of Hezbollah's shares.\"\n\n\n\nHezbollah has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against U.S., Israeli, and other Western targets and the United States lists it as a terrorist organization. But many in Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East -- particularly Shiites -- view Hezbollah militants as freedom fighters.",

He bounced back from four early bogeys with a late birdie and an eagle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got to win and I imagine Webb must have to finish pretty low to give me a chance,\" Scott, who birdied the last two holes for the second day in a row, told the PGA Tour website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just figured if I win this week, I'll be happy no matter what. I'll finish what I think has been a really good season, moving in the right direction with everything, and look forward to next season.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVeteran Korean K.J. Choi matched the resurgent Scott, who has bloomed since taking on Tiger Woods' former caddy Steve Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi went into the weekend on seven-under 133 to be one shot clear of another in-form Australian, Jason Day, and world No. 1 Luke Donald.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You never know what can happen in the next two days,\" said Choi, who regularly donates part of his winnings to charities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know, if I were able to win that money ... I could put the money to good use through my foundation. But there's still two days left, so all I can do is try to finish it out and hope for the best.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald was the best of the top five as the Englishman carded 68, one shot worse than Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nBig-hitting Bubba Watson burst into contention with a 64 to be tied for fifth with first-round leader Keegan Bradley, Bill Haas (67) and Hunter Mahan (68).\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley, who won his first major at nearby Atlanta Athletic Club six weeks ago, followed up his opening 64 with a 71.\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow American Jason Dufner, who he beat in a playoff at the PGA Championship, was another shot back on 136 after a 70.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. 2 Dustin Johnson suffered two double bogeys in his 73 to fall to a tie for 26th in the 30-man field to a projected fourth overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngland's No. 3 Justin Rose was in a group of three at the bottom of the heap after a 75 dented his hopes.",

  "context": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Two Iranians who were caught up in the waves of arrests that followed the disputed presidential elections in June have accused their captors of raping them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy telling his story, Ibrahim Sharifi says, he \"committed social suicide so this incident wouldn't happen to others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Iranian man and a woman made the allegations in separate interviews with CNN. Both said they fled to Turkey from Iran after claiming to have been threatened by Iranian security services. While CNN does not normally use the names of alleged rape victims, their names are included here with their permission.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN could not independently confirm their accounts. But the testimony of one of the alleged rape victims, Ibrahim Sharifi, was revealed last month by a prominent Iranian opposition leader who claimed to have gathered at least four accounts of sexual assault this summer in Iranian prisons. Sharifi's allegations were also included in a report published last week by two Western human rights organizations investigating reports of abuse in Iranian prisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're encountering are numerous accounts of brutality, poor treatment, even torture, serious beatings, and a couple of cases, as you know, of alleged sexual assault -- rape,\" said Joe Stork, Middle East deputy director for Human Rights Watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iranian government has launched two investigations into the allegations. Iran's judiciary concluded there was no evidence of rape. A parliamentary fact-finding committee is still working on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeated calls by CNN to get reaction from Iranian officials to the claims of the alleged victims did not result in a response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Take him and get him pregnant\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-four-year-old Ibrahim Sharifi is a university student from Tehran who campaigned actively on the Internet for opposition presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi in the run-up to the controversial June 12 vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared winner, Sharifi joined the throngs of angry protesters in the streets who accused the government of rigging the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 22, Sharifi said, he was kidnapped, handcuffed, blindfolded and stuffed into a car by three unknown men while he was walking home from language lessons at the Italian Embassy. He said they drove him to an unknown location, where he was stripped to his underwear. There, he said, he endured several days of beatings and mock executions alongside other male prisoners, all the time tightly blindfolded.  Watch Ibrahim Sharifi describe being tortured and sexually assaulted \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They took us and they put a noose around my neck in a way that I was forced to stand on my tiptoes, unable to breathe,\" Sharifi said. \"Somebody was constantly telling us ... 'You have received the oral sentence to be hanged, we are just waiting for the written order.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was the stink of piss and blood. It smelled terrible,\" Sharifi recalled. \"I was beaten so much I didn't have any energy left to cry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the fourth day of his detention, during one of these mock executions, Sharifi said he finally snapped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said, if you want to kill us, go ahead. Why do you play such games with us? And the response was a kick in my stomach that made me fall.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSharifi said his captors kicked him repeatedly in the stomach until he started vomiting blood. He showed a pink scar on his belly from a previous car accident that he said was torn open by the blows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then the guy told someone else, 'Take him and get him pregnant,'\" Sharifi said, his voice cracking with emotion. \"They tied my hands to the wall and tied my legs, and then did that thing to me. While doing it, he was telling me, \"You, who cannot even defend your you-know-what, you wanted to conduct a revolution?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSharifi said he blacked out during the rape and woke up later, handcuffed to a hospital bed. A day later, he said, his captors dumped him, blindfolded, on the side of a highway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was raped. Raped four times\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Maryam Sabri spoke to CNN by telephone from a Turkish city where, like Sharifi, she is waiting for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to process her request for asylum.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she was arrested by men in plainclothes on July 30 while attending a ceremony at the grave of Neda Agha-Soltan, the Iranian woman whose death was captured by cell phone camera after she was shot during a protest in the streets of Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I asked them where was I being taken to, why have you arrested me, who are you?\" their response was a constant slap on my face,\" Sabri recounted.\n\n\n\n\n\nSabri said she was interrogated several times after being detained. The sexual assault began during the third interrogation, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He said, 'OK, you wanted your vote back? Now I'm going to give back your vote.\" It was then that I was raped. Raped four times,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My hands were tied and my eyes were blindfolded,\" she said. \"He threw me on the ground while pressing my throat with one hand, and both my legs were under the weight of his legs so I couldn't move at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSabri said the last time she was raped, her assailant took off her blindfold and said he would release her on the condition that, once out of prison, she remain in contact with him and cooperate with him.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral days after her release, Sabri said the alleged rapist, described as a man in his late 30s with light eyes and several days' worth of stubble, began calling her on her cell phone and threatening her.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe fled Iran several weeks later and applied for refugee status in Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\nRape as punishment?\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights organizations Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran have expressed alarm about the reports of sexual assault in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The issue is, are the authorities using rape as a tool to pressure people, to punish people?\" asked Stork, the Middle East deputy director for Human Rights Watch. \"In the case of the one individual, Ibrahim Sharifi, it appears it was a punishment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIran's parliament and judiciary launched investigations into the allegations. But last month, Iranian security forces raided the offices of Karrubi, the opposition presidential candidate and longtime advocate for prisoners' rights who first publicized the rape allegations. The offices of another opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi, were also raided in September.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran's powerful conservative parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, said a special committee of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, conducted a \"precise and comprehensive inquiry\" into the treatment at Tehran's Evin and Kahrizak prisons and found \"no cases of rape or sexual abuse,\" government-funded Press TV reported last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nLarijani accused Karrubi of spreading \"sheer lies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, not everyone was persuaded by the investigation. \"The Iranian authorities appear more intent on finding the identities of those who claim to have been tortured by security officials than in carrying out an impartial investigation,\" said Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan.\n\n\n\n\n\nSabri and Sharifi are members of a growing population of expatriate Iranian dissidents in Turkey. Both face an uncertain future as refugees here and worry about the safety of their families back in Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\nSabri claims her father was arrested after she first went public with her rape testimony on the U.S. government-funded network Voice of America.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharifi, meanwhile, said that before he fled Iran, government investigators accused him of lying about his prison experience for money ... charges he angrily denies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I broke a taboo in Iran,\" he said, weeping. \"I sat in front of the camera and committed social suicide so this incident wouldn't happen to others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want the whole world to know that Iran's problems are not only limited to the nuclear issue,\" he said. \"The Iranian regime plays games with other countries of the world. It plays the same games with its own nation and people.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- An 11th person has died because of injuries sustained in the crash Friday at an air race at Reno, Nevada, an official with the Washoe County Medical Examiner's Office said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo details about this latest victim were released. The official, Michelle Anderson, said there would be a news conference revealing more information late Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have so far identified seven people who died from the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list includes the pilot, 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward, who lost control of his vintage plane before it plummeted into a crowd of spectators.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and six others were killed on the tarmac, while four have now died at hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 70 people were injured in the crash. Five patients remained hospitalized Tuesday at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center, four in serious condition and one in fair condition, the hospital said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators with the National Transportation Safety Board announced Sunday that the World War II-era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determine what happened and why.\n\n\n\n\n\nNTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as \"significant new information.\" It was also not entirely expected, given the relatively small size and nature of the P-51 aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it; this is the first one I came across,\" said Howard Plagens, the NTSB official heading the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlagens was referring to a \"box\" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators do have a copy of the \"box\" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the cards, Rosekind said, parts of a plane's tail, an \"elevator trim tab\" and video camera fragments have been found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were thousands of pieces of debris,\" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine whether these came from the plane. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said Sunday that Leeward did not send a \"Mayday call,\" indicating he was in distress.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab, which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators also will pore over \"a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured\" at the scene, according to Rosekind.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preliminary report will be available Friday, but Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,\" he said Sunday. \"(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- A 47-year-old woman who became paralyzed after breaking her neck and back on a turbulent flight is developing some motion in her toes and regaining some sensation after two operations, her doctor said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nDr. Trey Fulp, an orthopedic spine surgeon who performed the surgeries at McAllen Medical Center in McAllen, Texas, told CNN that the woman initially was paralyzed from the chest down.\n\n\n\nShe underwent six hours of surgery Saturday and a more than five-hour operation late Tuesday, the surgeon said.\n\n\n\n\"She is very brave and is talking,\" Fulp said. \"If she walks again, I get the first dance.\"\n\n\n\nThe woman was on Continental Flight 511 en route from Houston, Texas, to McAllen early Saturday, a one-hour trip that had been delayed more than three hours because of severe storms that barreled through the Houston area on Friday night.\n\n\n\nThe woman's attorney, Ramon Garcia, said Tuesday that his client struck her head on the bathroom ceiling when the plane suddenly dropped during turbulence.\n\n\n\n\"We have a lady who got out of her seat and went to the bathroom,\" Garcia said. \"And while either in the bathroom or coming out of the bathroom is when this situation occurred.\"\n\n\n\nThe woman was stretched out on the plane's floor for the remainder of the flight until paramedics could start treating her, the attorney said.\n\n\n\nFulp said another physician was on the flight. When that doctor realized the woman couldn't get up, he held her until the flight landed 20 minutes later.\n\n\n\nGarcia said his client, a mother of three, did not want to be identified.\n\n\n\nContinental spokeswoman Mary Clark on Tuesday confirmed that the flight -- carrying 104 passengers and five crew members -- experienced turbulence and that two passengers and a crew member were transported to a hospital in McAllen. Clark said one passenger and the crew member were released, but the other passenger remains hospitalized.\n\n\n\n\"Our focus is assisting the customer who is still in hospital and her family,\" Clark said.\n\n\n\nSeat belt lights were illuminated during the turbulence, the spokeswoman said. However, it's not clear whether the passenger was already out of her seat when the light came on or whether she ignored the light and got up to go to the bathroom.\n\n\n\nFederal aviation authorities are investigating.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said it's providing crucial flight information to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n\n\nCNN's Melanie Whitley and Ekin Middleton contributed to this report.",

And, Hussein supporters and schoolchildren have made visits there on the late dictator's birthday and hanging date.\n\n\n\nThere have been videos on sites such as YouTube of people at the site.\n\n\n\nOne video shows schoolchildren at the grave in December; they carried banners at Hussein's grave that said \"We won't forget you father\" and they read pro-Hussein poetry.\n\n\n\nThe government move was made after a recent visit by schoolchildren to the grave, but no reason was given for the decision.\n\n\n\nHowever, the move reflects the concern of Iraq's government over the presence of the Baath Party in Iraq, Saddam Hussein's political movement.\n\n\n\nThe party and its symbols have been banned in Iraq.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told reporters that while there can be government reconciliation with individual Baathists who have not committed crimes such as killing Iraqis, there can never be national reconciliation with the party itself.\n\n\n\nSalaheddin Gov. Mutasher Hussein Alaiwi, said he had not received any official directives yet, but said he would implement Cabinet orders when he receives them.\n\n\n\nThe governor said that would apply to organized group visits, but they would not stop individual ones.\n\n\n\nA resident of al-Ouja told CNN the government had no right to stop visitors from going to their former president's tomb.\n\n\n\n\"Even if they put police and army outside the door, they will not stop us from visiting our president, our leader and our father,\" said Mohammed al- Nasiri.\n\n\n\nHussein was executed in 2006 after an Iraqi court sentenced him to death for crimes against humanity.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Four senators pushed for a bill Wednesday to ban texting while driving, a day after a study found that drivers who text while on the road are much more likely to have an accident than undistracted drivers.\n\n\n\nA law that went into effect January 1 in California makes it illegal to send text messages while driving.\n\n\n\nSens. Chuck Schumer, D-New York; Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana; and Kay Hagan, D-North Carolina, unveiled the ALERT Act, which would ban truck and car drivers and operators of mass transit from texting while driving.\n\n\n\nThe proposed legislation would prohibit any driver from sending text or e-mail messages while driving a vehicle, said an earlier news release from the senators.\n\n\n\nIf the bill passes, the Department of Transportation would set the minimum standards for compliance.\n\n\n\nStates that do not enact text-banning laws within two years of the bill's passage could lose 25 percent of their federal highway funds, Schumer said in a news conference announcing the legislation. The noncompliant states could recuperate that money once they meet the text-banning standards, Schumer said.\n\n\n\nCTIA, a cellular phone industry group, said that it supports legislation that addresses text messaging while driving.\n\n\n\n\"CTIA and our member companies continue to believe text messaging while driving is incompatible with safe driving,\" said a statement on CTIA's Web site.\n\n\n\nFourteen states, including the home states of three of the bill's sponsors, and the District of Columbia already have laws barring texting while driving: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Washington.  Interactive map: See state-by-state policies on distracted driving \u00bb\n\n\n\nNew York does not ban texting while driving but has barred the use of handheld phones while driving, according to the Governor's Highway Safety Association. Schumer said New York's legislature has sent Gov. David Paterson a bill to ban texting as well.\n\n\n\n\"The legislation will send an important message to drivers across the country: Get your hands off the cell phone and back on the wheel,\" Schumer said.\n\n\n\nThe senators cited a Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study that found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or get into a near-accident than undistracted drivers. Watch more on the dangers of driving and texting\n\n\n\nWhen compared with dialing, talking, listening or reaching for an electronic device, texting posed the greatest accident risk, the study found. It attributed the increased risk to the almost five seconds it found that the driver's eyes were off the roadway while texting, said Rich Hanowski, the director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the transportation institute.\n\n\n\n\"Not having [a cell phone] in your hand while driving could be the difference between life and death,\" Menendez said.\n\n\n\nIn September, a commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend, leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people in California, according to federal investigators. The accident also injured 101 people.\n\n\n\nIn May, 62 people were injured when one trolley struck another in Boston, Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said. In July, the operator of one trolley was charged with gross negligence after he admitted to texting seconds before the accident with the other trolley, according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official.\n\n\n\nCNN Radio's John Lisk contributed to this report.",

Antony, meeting with India's military chiefs in Delhi, reviewed the situation in the Himalayan region and told the Army to deal with the situation in the Himalayan region with \"utmost firmness.\"\n\n\n\nKashmir has been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for nearly two decades during which authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, various NGOs and rights groups put the number of dead at twice the official count.\n\n\n\nIn Srinigar, Kashmir, Army spokesman Lt. Col. J.S. Brar told CNN the Army was moving against the militants \"based on sound intelligence inputs as well as human intelligence provided by our own sources.\"\n\n\n\nThe battles in the Shamsbhari forests of north Kashmir Kupwara district have caused \"minimum collateral damage to property,\" Brar said.\n\n\n\nThe spokesman denied media reports that helicopter gunships and heavy weapons had been used by the army during these operations against the militants.\n\n\n\nThis month's encounter between the Indian Army and the militants is the second longest in Kashmir this year. In January, a fierce encounter raged for seven days in the Poonch district of Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Two soldiers, a policeman and four militants were killed in that encounter.\n\n\n\nKashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and neighboring Pakistan.

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of \"You Can Vote However You Like\" catapulted them to online stardom.\n\n\n\n\"The higher the expectations, the higher the results,\" says Ron Clark, seen here with his students.\n\n\n\nNow, their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just \"one hit wonders.\"\n\n\n\nAcademy students showcased their poetry and writings for CNN's documentary \"Black in America 2,\" hosted by Soledad O'Brien.\n\n\n\nCultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder Ron Clark, an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods.\n\n\n\nUnder his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers.\n\n\n\n\"I'm teaching an eighth-grade curriculum to fifth-graders,\" says Clark. \"Some people say my expectations of the kids, academically, is too high, but the higher the expectations, the higher the results.\"  Watch Clark's students perform their original poetry \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun.\n\n\n\nIt's become one of Clark's trademarks: singing and dancing to popular rap and R&B songs during class to get the kids engaged.\n\n\n\n\"My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths,\" says seventh-grader Jai Springs.\n\n\n\n\"I thought Ron Clark was going crazy. He was up in front of the kids on desks, he was dancing. ... I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance. But now I'm used to it, so I get up on the desk and dance too,\" says Jai.\n\n\n\nClark, formerly a schoolteacher from North Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom.\n\n\n\nClark was invited to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show after winning Disney Teacher of the Year Award in 2001. Oprah believed so much in the well-mannered Southern school teacher from South Carolina that she encouraged him to write the book. Later she promoted The Essential 55 on her show, prompting it's ascension to New York Times bestseller list.\n\n\n\nTogether with co-founder Kim Bearden, Clark transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of Atlanta, Georgia, into a state-of-the-art educational model for middle schools across the country. See newsmakers and iReporters on race, challenges, solutions for black America\n\n\n\nSoon after the school opened its doors in 2008, a Christmas package from Winfrey arrived for Clark in the form of a $365,000 grant, or \"a thousand dollars for each day of the year,\" as Oprah referred to it in the letter.\n\n\n\nThen came the elections, with a tight presidential race between Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona.\n\n\n\nInspired by rapper T.I.'s hit song \"Whatever You Like,\" Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves. The students' performance carried a message: Cast your ballot because you support a candidate's policies rather than just his skin color.\n\n\n\nWhen they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: \"Obama on the left. McCain on the right. We can talk politics all night. And you can vote however you like.\"\n\n\n\nThe students \"can talk politics with the best of them,\" says Clark. Video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\"We got lots of media attention. But when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story, it's the kids,\" says Clark.\n\n\n\nOne of Clark's credos is teaching a \"global curriculum\" with a heavy emphasis on current events. Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live.\n\n\n\nThrough Delta's corporate sponsorship of the school, administrators have been able to send all 100 of their fifth to eighth grade students abroad before they graduate.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not nearly as shy as I used to be,\" says seventh-grader Chi Chi Kasarachi after her first year at the academy.\n\n\n\n\"My knowledge of the world has improved, I know more about what's going on in other countries and I'm more curious about things. ... I'm just hungry for knowledge,\" says Chi Chi.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the students at Ron Clark Academy are better versed in current events and politics than many adults.\n\n\n\n\"I never thought I'd be interested in watching the news,\" says seventh-grader Osei Avril. \"Now I find it interesting because I have learned the stories behind the news,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOsei -- who pronounces Iranian President Ahmadinajad's name perfectly -- says he's interested in learning about world issues such as the Iranian elections, the Taliban in Pakistan, and the Palestinian- Israeli conflict.\n\n\n\n\"At the beginning,\" says Clark, \"the kids will say something like 'I've been to East Point [a suburb of South Atlanta]. After a few years they've been to Kenya, Japan, or South Africa, or England. ... They've become very comfortable with understanding the country and understanding themselves.\"\n\n\n\nBut it's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special, say the students. It's the academy teachers' creative ways of instilling education, solid values, and a passion for learning.\n\n\n\n\"They want you to pass the people at the top,\" says Jai. \"To be at the top nonstop, be at your fullest, to be creative, to think out of the box.\"\n\n\n\nBut school isn't all fun and games, she says. Clark is a strict disciplinarian that expects -- and enforces -- model behavior from all of the students.\n\n\n\n\"I love Mr. Clark with all my heart, he's like a father to me,\" says Chi Chi. \"He might fuss a lot, but I know he's doing it for our own good.\"",

All are felony charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBail was set at $200,000, the statement said, but authorities said Tuesday afternoon Lohan had not been booked. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after he complained of \"a medical condition not related to the incident\" following his arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe will remain at the hospital on observation for at least 24 hours before he is booked at the West Hollywood Station, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sheriff's department did not identify the alleged victim.  But Kate Major, Lohan's former fiancee, told CNN she was the victim. \"I can confirm but barely type,\" Major wrote in an e-mail. \"No other comment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alleged victim suffered minor injuries but refused medical treatment, the sheriff's department said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLohan was arrested near West Hollywood Station following the incident when deputies saw him walking on Santa Monica Boulevard, the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Michael Lohan and his 24-year-old daughter has been publicly strained for years, although the two did undergo family counseling together during her recent treatment at the Betty Ford Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Lohan must decide by Wednesday if she will accept a plea deal that would send her to jail or move closer to a trial on a felony grand theft charge. She is accused of walking out without paying for a $2,500 necklace from Kamofie and Co., a jewelry store in Venice, California, on January 22.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Lindsay Lohan decides to go to trial, a preliminary hearing will be held April 22. The judge at that time would also consider the matter of her probation violation; she faces possible jail time for violating her probation for a drunk-driving arrest because of the theft charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Brittany Kaplan, Carey Bodenheimer and Alan Duke contributed to this report.",

He noted the initial outpouring of money and relief aid for Haiti, which he called generous in the face of human catastrophe.\n\n\n\n\"The difficulty we face, then, is not one of concern but rather one of coordination,\" Harper said. \"We must ensure that every resource committed -- every relief worker, every vehicle, every dollar -- is used as effectively as possible.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States has committed $100 million in emergency aid to Haiti, and Clinton said Monday \"there will be more to come.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Clinton noted to reporters that even before the quake, Haiti had an economic development plan worked out with the United Nations and others that was intended to modernize the economy after decades of political and social instability. The earthquake required a revision of the plan, rather than scrapping it entirely, she said.\n\n\n\n\"It was a legitimate plan. It was done in conjunction with other international donors, with the United Nations,\" Clinton said. \"And I don't want to start from scratch, but we have to recognize the changed challenges we are now confronting.\"\n\n\n\nBellerive, in comments at the meeting reported by CTV, also said Haiti must achieve a new development path rather than simply returning to the same situation that existed before the earthquake.\n\n\n\n\"What we are speaking about is relaunching our country on a path of development. It is not a question of going back to the status quo,\" he said, according to CTV.\n\n\n\nPort-au-Prince will have to be rebuilt and public institutions decentralized to meet the needs of the hundreds of thousands of Haitians expected to relocate to rural areas, CTV reported Bellerive as saying.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Monday's meeting provided an opportunity for the donor community, the Haitian government and the United Nations to review progress so far in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Haiti.\n\n\n\nA senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to reporters in Washington, said the countries attending the Montreal meeting want to avoid pouring money into Haiti in ways that previously have yielded little result.\n\n\n\nPriorities might include agriculture, reforestation and building new roads, with projects carried out in coordination with the Haitian government, according to the diplomat.\n\n\n\nThe diplomat also said France is ready to host a donors' conference on the Caribbean island of Martinique.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry said Monday that the nation donated $50 million to Haiti for relief aid. The spokesman, Usama al-Nugali, said the money has already been received by the United Nations.\n\n\n\nMonday's meeting came as Haitians reacted with anger and frustration to news that efforts to rescue possible survivors had been called off.\n\n\n\nLooking for loved ones in Haiti\n\n\n\nThousands of people pushed Sunday for rescue efforts to continue after a 24-year-old man was pulled alive from rubble Saturday, 11 days after the earthquake. He had no injuries, but was dehydrated. His brother said he had survived on cookies and beer from the store of the Hotel Napoli Inn, where he worked. He is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\n\nFamilies of Americans who were staying at the Hotel Montana started an online petition Saturday in an effort to get search efforts to continue \"until all the survivors are accounted for.\"\n\n\n\nAs of Sunday morning, 2,395 people had signed the petition and sent 6,216 messages to the Senate, Congress and the White House, said Sue Keller, a friend of a family whose relatives are among the missing.\n\n\n\nSo far, 59 Americans, including three children, are confirmed dead in the magnitude-7.0 earthquake, the U.S. State Department said Monday.\n\n\n\nThe deaths include one U.S. embassy employee, previously identified as Victoria DeLong, and three children of embassy employees, according to Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley.\n\n\n\nAnother 37 Americans are presumed dead, Crowley said.\n\n\n\nAbout 11,500 Americans and some of their Haitian family members, who had medical emergencies or other circumstances, have been evacuated from Haiti, according to Crowley.\n\n\n\nThe Haitian government has said the earthquake is believed to have killed at least 150,000 people.\n\n\n\nTired of stench, Haitians torch bodies in plaza\n\n\n\nThe rescues that occurred over the past week sparked hope among families of the missing. International search teams have rescued at least 132 people, the United Nations said.\n\n\n\nMore than 600,000 people have been left homeless in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Jill Dougherty, Mohammed Jamjoom, Elise Labott and Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.",

She asks the kids about their anxieties and confronts Jay about the climate of fear in his house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heenes reportedly allowed their children to accompany them as they tracked Hurricane Gustav.\n\n\n\n\n\nA YouTube video of the family appearing on Denver, Colorado's KMGH local newscast features two of the Heene sons briefly discussing chasing the Hurricane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What my kids learn from these storms and what they walk away with is the fact that these storms can be very deadly,\" Richard Heene told the KMGH reporter.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the newscast, the family track 30 to 40 weather activities a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family was invited back by ABC to appear on the 100th episode of \"Wife Swap,\" where Mayumi Heene switched places with Sheree Silver, a psychic.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Los Angeles Times story documented the show by saying \"The Heene family, with its three rowdy boys, is anchored by father Richard, whose anger arrives in sudden bolts between his fringe science projects.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Silvers, who have two quirky, artistically inclined sons, revolve around the mother, Sheree, who is a psychic and who initially fails to impress Richard. 'Sheree's like a clogged drain, OK? Things aren't happening,' he barks. 'I'll bet you the heaviest thing she lifts is the fork to her mouth.' \"\n\n\n\n\n\nMayumi Heene reportedly found it difficult on the show to adjust to Silver's household.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's their spouses who struggle most,\" the Los Angeles Times story said. \"Richard's wife, Mayumi, finding Sheree's 'househusband,' Sam Castiglia, to be 'a very feminine husband' and finds it tough to even tolerate the quirks of the Silver children, who are so unlike her own, seeming less like a parent than a conspirator against the alien family. So much for learning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA balloon that was set adrift from the Heenes' Fort Collins, Colorado, home was empty when it landed, and authorities later found one of the Heene sons -- who initially had been thought to be in the balloon -- safe on the ground. Officials said he had been hiding in the attic of the family's garage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat appears to be the three Heene boys are featured in a YouTube rap music video that seems to spoof overprotective parents.",

  "context": "Dresden, Germany (CNN) -- Wouldn't it be great if you could simply grab carbon dioxide from the air and turn it back into fuel?\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Germany-based renewable energy start-up Sunfire, you can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In fact, the idea has been around since at least the 70s,\" says Christian von Olshausen, the company's Chief Technology Officer. But the process is expensive. \"For as long as fossil fuels have been cheap and readily available, there's not been sufficient demand,\" he adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow -- with the world's finite stock of crude oil on the wane, and amidst pressure to reduce global carbon dioxide (C02) emissions -- the idea of converting those very carbons back into what Olshausen calls \"synthetic fuels\" is becoming more financially viable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The combustion of synthetic fuel does not increase the amount of C02 in the atmosphere,\" he explains. \"This is because the carbon is being continuously recycled.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic fuel can come in the form of everything from diesel to gasoline to wax. But while the process is simple in theory (see factbox), it is unwieldy in practice -- demanding ultra-high temperatures which gobble up electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The operation is only practical now that we have relatively cheap sources of renewable electricity to power it,\" says Olshausen.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing conventional electricity was never an option, he adds, after all \"what's the point of turning carbon into fuel if the electricity you're using to do it burns up more carbon than you started with?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this highlights an uncomfortable fact: Sunfire's synthetic fuel contains only 70% of the energy that goes into making it, as heat is lost during the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, why waste hard-won green electricity to produce old-fashioned petrol?\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jeff Hardy is head of the UK's National Energy Research Network (NERN). He says that, while all efforts should be made to reduce our dependence on liquid fuels, it may not be possible for some industries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The thing with fuel is that it offers very high density energy storage ... for areas like long haul aviation, it's hard to see what could replace it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, global oil consumption is currently about 30 billion barrels a year. Hardy points out that, even if we reduce our thirst for fossil fuels to just one or two percent of this figure over the next century, we may still need millions of barrels for things like commercial flight that are unable to use electricity for power.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould synthetic fuel really plug that gap? At present, Sunfire is moving out of the lab and is talking to car and aircraft-makers in the hope of increasing fuel production to an industrial scale. They are aiming for production to hit one barrel a day within the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot, that's because it's not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is going to be a long process,\" admits Olshausen. \"I'd estimate that it will take between one to two decades before we can replace a single digit percent of current demand (for fuel).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem, he says, is developing materials that can resist extraordinarily high temperatures for long periods of time without degrading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we'll do it,\" insists Olshausen. \"Many innovations in the past century, like the car or the computer, have had to overcome seemingly impossible thermodynamic obstacles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSwiss engineer Dominique Kronenberg is certainly hoping that companies like Sunfire will be successful in the long run. He is chief operating officer of Climeworks, a firm that specializes in capturing carbon from the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The question is, what do we do with the carbon once we've got it?\" he asks. \"At present, the main markets are quite niche -- things like carbonated fizzy drinks, computer cooling systems and industrial greenhouses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's no surprise then that Kronenberg and his team have been working with Sunfire to flesh out the logistics of a future partnership. The potential market, he says, is a huge and \"much more profitable than storing the carbon underground, that's for sure.\"",

  "context": "Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's interim leaders will declare liberation on Sunday and hold elections in the coming months as the war-torn country works toward building a new society in the post-Moammar Gadhafi era.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahmoud Jibril, chairman of the National Transitional Council executive board, said elections \"should be within a period of eight months, maximum.\" He spoke at the World Economic Forum in Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first vote will be for a National Congress that will draft a constitution. After that, parliamentary and presidential elections will be held.\n\n\n\n\n\nJibril said that oil-rich Libya is currently producing around 300,000 barrels per day, up from near zero during the depths of the conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country should be back at its prewar output of 1.6 million barrels of oil per day within 15 months, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the NTC, which will mark the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO, which launched an operation to protect Libyan citizens against the Gadhafi regime during the Libyan war, plans to ends its operations by October 31.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking in his weekly address Saturday, Obama said Gadhafi's death \"showed that our role in protecting the Libyan people, and helping them break free from a tyrant, was the right thing to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our brave pilots and crews helped prevent a massacre, save countless lives, and give the Libyan people the chance to prevail. Without putting a single U.S. service member on the ground, we achieved our objectives. Soon, our NATO mission will come to a successful end even as we continue to support the Libyan people, and people across the Arab world, who seek a democratic future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions persist about what would happen to Gadhafi's body, which was on public display Saturday at a Misrata meat market cooler. Queues of people lined up to view the corpse, which appeared to have a bullet hole on the left temple.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership \"to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,\" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nLibyan and world powers wanted to capture Gadhafi and prosecute him for war crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N. human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into his death amid questions over the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life. They want to know whether Gadhafi was killed in crossfire or executed by fighters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are at least two cell-phone videos, one showing him alive and one showing him dead. Taken together, these videos are very disturbing,\" human rights office spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch, which is also calling for an internationally supervised autopsy and an investigation into the death, said it is unlikely that Gadhafi was killed in crossfire.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Bouckaert, the group's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a \"humiliating end\" for the former dictator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When he left the area, he was very much alive,\" Bouckaert said. \"There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Dan Rivers and Victoria Brown contributed to this report",

It's a roof over a grass court and it's not like a football or rugby pitch, we need it to be absolutely bone dry.\n\n\"We have to test the air conditioning and playing surface as well.\"\n\nFormer champion John McEnroe is also being lined up to make a sentimental return to Centre Court.\n\n\"We are looking to put together a good raft of people to come and play.\n\n\"We will probably put several matches on as we want to put on a day of entertainment and enjoyment to try to get a maximum crowd to come and see it,\" said Ritchie.\n\nWimbledon first announced plans for a retractable roof over Centre Court in 2004, with the redevelopment increasing the capacity to 15,000.\n\nIt will mean an end, on Centre Court at least, to the famous Wimbledon rain delays, which have frustrated spectators and players alike over the years, arguably costing Henman his best chance of Wimbledon glory in 2001 when he lost a protracted semifinal to eventual winner Goran Ivanisevic.",

  "context": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, warned Thursday of an indication of an attack to Bali on New Year's Eve.\n\n\n\nThe Embassy said the warning initially came from the Bali governor, Mangku Pastika, and that it passed on his alert verbatim. The governor, however, said there was no information about a new terrorist threat.\n\n\n\n\"We never release(d) any warning related to terror on New Year's Eve,\" the governor's office said in a statement after the Embassy released the warning.\n\n\n\n\"We however encourage both domestic and foreign tourists to be cautious,\" the governor's office said. \"The terrorists hit Bali twice. Who knows what they will do next.\"\n\n\n\nPastika's office said there was only a general alert on the island because of the holiday.\n\n\n\nTerrorist groups, including Jemaah Islamiyah, have carried out repeated attacks in Bali and elsewhere in Indonesia since 2002.\n\n\n\nThe Embassy did not elaborate on the governor's message, but the United States has a standing warning to U.S. citizens in Indonesia that extremists may target both official and private interests, including hotels, clubs, and shopping centers.\n\n\n\n\"In their work and daily living activities, and while traveling, U.S. citizens should be vigilant and prudent at all times,\" the U.S. State Department warning states. \"We urge U.S. citizens to monitor local news reports, vary their routes and times, and maintain a low profile. U.S. citizens must consider the security and safety preparedness of hotels, residences, restaurants, and entertainment or recreation venues that they frequent.\"\n\n\n\nUnknown attackers shot at foreigners in Banda Aceh, in northern Sumatra, last month, wounding a European development worker, the Embassy said. The attackers also targeted a house occupied by American teachers, but no U.S. citizens were hurt, it said.\n\n\n\nThe most major recent attack was in July, when suspected Jemaah Islamiyah elements bombed two western hotels in Jakarta. The blasts at the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels killed nine people -- including at least two presumed suicide bombers -- and wounded more than 50, including U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\nAlso in July, armed assailants in Papua killed several people, including security personnel and one Australian national, the Embassy said.\n\n\n\nJemaah Islamiyah, said to have links to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network, is blamed for the 2002 Bali bomb attacks in which 202 people, mainly foreign tourists, were killed.\n\n\n\nMore than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta. Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces.\n\n\n\nThe bombing was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah.\n\n\n\nThe group was also said to be behind an attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta in 2004 in which nine people died, and an attack on the same Marriott hotel that killed eight the same year.\n\n\n\n-- CNN's Atika Shubert in Bali and Andy Saputra in Jakarta contributed to this report.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- They prefer the darkness and calm of early morning when their targets are most vulnerable, still sleeping or under the influence. They make sure their prey -- suspected killers and other violent fugitives -- know what they're up against.\n\n\n\nU.S. Marshal supervisory inspector James Ergas takes aim during a computer-simulated attack.\n\n\n\n\"When they wake up to a submachine gun and flashlight in their face, they tend not to fight,\" says James Ergas, the supervisory inspector for the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service is the nation's oldest law enforcement agency and best known for protecting federal judges, transporting federal prisoners and protecting witnesses. Less known is the cutting-edge work of the agency's six regional task forces in capturing suspects.\n\n\n\nThe task force in Atlanta is located in a nondescript warehouse office park. In 2007, the investigators from the Southeast task force arrested more than 3,000 suspects; only once did the Marshals exchange gunfire, Ergas says.  Watch Ergas blast bad guys in simulated attack \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"This is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the Marshal Service,\" says Eugene O'Donnell, a former prosecutor and New York City police officer who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.\n\n\n\nOn any given day, Ergas and his force are tracking 10 to 15 suspected killers roaming the Southeast, while also searching for other violent offenders. Already this year, they have been involved in a number of high-profile searches: Gary Michael Hilton, the suspect charged in the killing of Meredith Emerson who disappeared while hiking in northern Georgia; a fugitive Marine wanted in connection with the killing of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach in North Carolina; and suspects wanted in connection with the killings of two suburban Atlanta police officers.\n\n\n\nBut most of the time they're chasing suspects outside of the glare of the media spotlight.\n\n\n\n\"Our mandate is to track violent fugitives -- murderers, armed robbers, rapists and fugitives of that caliber,\" says Keith Booker, the commander of the task force.  Watch Booker describe their mission \u00bb\n\n\n\nOne suspect currently being hunted is Charles Leon Parker who has been on the run since the 1980s after being accused of molesting his stepdaughters. The Marshals were brought in recently, Booker says, after Parker allegedly called one of his victims and said, \"I wanted you to know I saw you and your daughter, and she sure is beautiful.\"\n\n\n\nO'Donnell says it takes highly trained, high energy, \"really special people\" to do such work day in and day out, especially when they're up against \"some of the most dangerous individuals in the country.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not an exaggeration to say they're the front of the front line,\" O'Donnell says. \"It's not going to get any more challenging than this in law enforcement.\"\n\n\n\nTo make sure they are well prepared, the Atlanta office is equipped with a locker full of high-powered weaponry; a high-tech operations center, complete with flat screen TVs, where they communicate directly with investigators in the field; a two-story house for training; and a 300-degree computer simulator that puts the Marshals into real life danger scenarios.\n\n\n\nIn one demonstration, Ergas steps into the simulator and responds to reports of shots fired at a workplace. A woman rushes to a victim on the ground, as Ergas barks out commands. Moments later, a man rounds the corner. He too tends to the victim. Suddenly, the gunman runs into the corner and Ergas opens fire with his Glock. The suspect hits the ground.  Watch Ergas say there's no better training than the simulator \u00bb\n\n\n\nA split second later, another gunman emerges, and Ergas blasts him too. Think of it as Wii on steroids.\n\n\n\n\"These are things you cannot get on a range,\" Ergas says.\n\n\n\nThere are 50 different scenarios the simulator can create, with a technician able to change each scenario. A trainee can use a shotgun, rifle, Glock 22 or Glock 23. The guns shoot a laser and each shot is traced. Sometimes, the simulator jams the guns to see how one responds to the situation.\n\n\n\nAfter each training session, the person is debriefed about why he or she opened fire or didn't fire at all. Each shot is analyzed, because in the real world a law enforcement officer is held accountable for every bullet that comes out of his or her gun.\n\n\n\nIt helps investigators train for situations they could face on any given day, at any given moment, Ergas says.\n\n\n\n\"No one wants to shoot anyone,\" Ergas says. \"Even officers that may not have pulled the trigger will be affected by shooting and killing someone.\"\n\n\n\nO'Donnell says the fact the task force rarely engages fire with suspects and that they have such rigorous training, \"underscores you can teach tactics.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is a model,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBooker says it helps having a coordinated team of armed officers with shields and big guns, as well. \"We overwhelm them with surprising speed and force,\" he says. \"That's what keeps us safe, and that's what keeps them safe.\"\n\n\n\nHis message for those still out there?\n\n\n\n\"We'll pull all of our collective knowledge and resources and investigative techniques to hunt them down and take them into custody,\" Booker says. \"We won't stop until our job is finished.\" E-mail to a friend",

They were all of average height, police said.\n\n\n\nThere is a reward of $91,000 (100,00 Swiss francs) for information leading to the return of the paintings, police said.\n\n\n\nThe Swiss art heist follows the recent theft in Switzerland of two paintings by Pablo Picasso, Bjoern Quellenberg, a spokesman for the Kunsthaus, a major art museum in Zurich, said.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Consumers who bought \"Caylee Sunshine\" dolls and Michael Vick dog toys were misled into believing that a portion of their purchases would go to charity, according to a lawsuit filed this week.\n\nThe \"Caylee Sunshine\" doll cost $29.99 before Showbiz Promotions halted its production.\n\nThe Florida Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit Thursday against Showbiz Promotions and its owner, Jaime Salcedo, seeking $10,000 in penalties for each violation under the state's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n\nBut Salcedo denies the allegations, saying he has been trying to resolve the disputes and compensate charitable organizations. The Jacksonville-based entrepreneur claims he has been working with the attorney general's office for more than one year to settle the issue.\n\nThe suit also asks that Salcedo stop running the Web site, www.cayleedoll.com, his short-lived vehicle for selling dolls that critics said were modeled after slain Florida toddler Caylee Anthony. Salcedo says the doll was not meant to be Caylee, but rather a tribute to her memory.\n\nThe dispute began with the attorney general's investigation into complaints about dog chew toys in the likeness of suspended NFL star Michael Vick, who is serving a federal prison sentence for his role in a dogfighting operation.\n\nConsumers said they ordered and paid for merchandise from the company but did not receive the items, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that Showbiz Promotions told consumers that a portion of the proceeds would go to local animal shelters, another promise Salcedo allegedly never made good on.\n\n\"Defendant Salcedo began cooperating with the Attorney General and made attempts to either make delivery on consumer orders for the Vick Dog Chew Toy or to provide refunds. However, numerous consumer complaints remain unresolved,\" the complaint alleges.\n\nBut Salcedo claims the scope of the damage is less extensive. Of 200 complaints that he says the attorney general's office received, all but 10 were resolved.\n\n\"Those people purchased on PayPal, so the only way I had to get in touch was going though e-mail. If they don't respond, then I can't help them,\" he said in a telephone interview Friday.\n\nSalcedo also insists that his company made donations to animal shelters in forms of merchandise, including Vick chew toys, T-shirts and hats.\n\n\"They'd rather have $100 in toys because they can sell them or auction them off,\" he said. \"We said they could have either and every time they said they wanted the toys.\"\n\nThe suit also addresses Salcedo's promotion of the Caylee Sunshine Doll and other members of the Sunshine Doll Collection, including Gracie Sunshine and Hope Sunshine.\n\nThe dolls set off a firestorm of controversy with its launch in January, drawing allegations that Showbiz Promotions was attempting to profit off the death of Caylee Anthony, whose mother is facing trial for her murder. Members of the public, media pundits and the Anthony family called for production of the dolls to be halted.\n\nOne month later, Showbiz Promotions pulled the plug on the Sunshine Collection, citing high manufacturing costs and tepid consumer response. The company had fulfilled just five orders and provided refunds for 20, according to Salcedo.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the product's Web site, www.cayleedoll.com, falsely claimed that \"100% of the profits\" from the Sunshine Doll Collection would go to charity, accusing Salcedo of fabricating a donation receipt and posting it on the site so visitors could view \"the first donation\" made to charity.\n\nThe receipt -- a purported screen grab from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Web site -- shows an \"online credit card donation confirmation\" for $5,000 in the name of Showbiz Promotions, according to the lawsuit. Salcedo says he never posted any such image on the site.\n\nThe alleged receipt is attached as an exhibit to the lawsuit, along with another purported receipt in Salcedo's name that the attorney general's office says is the only existing NCMEC donation associated with Salcedo or Showbiz Promotions. See exhibits attached to the lawsuit\n\n\"The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children confirmed that their records showed that a donation was made by Jaime Salcedo on March 12, 2009 at [5:28 p.m.] in the amount of $10,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children confirmed that they had no record of a donation from Showbiz Promotions in any amount or any additional donation from Jaime Salcedo.\"\n\nSalcedo insists that the receipt for $5,000 is not real -- and says his company had nothing to do with it.\n\n\"They're saying this was posted on our Web site and clearly it was not. That is clearly something that someone made and sent to them and they're jumping the gun,\" he said.\n\nFurthermore, he does not deny making a $10 donation to NCMEC out of his own pocket.\n\n\"We had nothing left to give to charity apart from what I give every year, which is $10,\" he said. \"If giving $10 every year to charity is a crime, then I'm guilty.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- It's often said that a real Southerner can \"claim kin\" with anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Rand and his son Ripley learned last year that some of their relatives were African-American.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Rand realized the same could be true for him. Rand, whose family can trace its roots back to the 1700s, is a Democratic state senator in North Carolina. Until he watched the 2008 CNN documentary \"Black in America,\" he had no idea that some of his relatives were black.  Although firmly anchored in the South, the Rands are spread across the country. What connects them is their link to a common ancestor -- the family patriarch William Harrison Rand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hal\" Rand, as he was known to most, was a white farmer and slave owner. In 1842, Hal married Sarah Ann Mullens and they had seven children. Hal also fathered seven children with his mistress, Ann Albrooks Rand, a black woman.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery other year, hundreds of African-American descendants of Hal Rand get together at a different location for a massive family reunion. It's a time to catch up and share stories, eat barbecue and have a good time. The 2007 Rand family reunion, held in Atlanta, Georgia, was featured in \"Black in America.\" After the program aired, dozens of viewers across the country had the same revelation -- they, too, were related to the Rands.  \"I was sitting there, that Saturday night, just up reading the week's papers and watching the program,\" says Rand with a hearty Southern accent.  The Rand family's missing link \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then I hear, 'We are the Rands. The mighty, mighty Rands,\" he recalls, referring to the words sung by family members as they embarked on their bi-annual pilgrimage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And then I said to myself, 'What?'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Rand listened as the family historian, Martha Rand Hix, described the family's patriarch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they were talking about William Harrison Rand, I knew that was the William Harrison Rand in our family,\" he said. \"Then they started talking about North Carolina, and I said, 'Well, God oh mighty,' ... it was just amazing.\"  The next day, he telephoned his 41-year old son, Ripley Rand, and asked him to contact their black relatives. Soon, Tony and Ripley Rand were invited to attend the next Rand family reunion in July in Sacramento, California.  See photos of the Rand family members \u00bb  But, what Tony Rand didn't know was that his son, a North Carolina Superior Court judge, had already been diligently working on the family genealogy. Ripley Rand had begun typing out a hand-bound version of a 100-page manuscript compiled by his great-uncle, Oscar Ripley Rand III, and started to create a digital version.\n\n\n\n\n\nOscar Ripley Rand III was a Rhodes Scholar and retired Army colonel who spent years researching the family's history, according to Ripley Rand. Although Oscar Ripley Rand III had scoured the National Archives and spent years collecting information about the family, his memoirs contained no mention of William Harrison Rand's relationship and children with Ann Albrooks Rand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My whole life I have heard about the history of our family and we had no idea about [the African-American side of the family],\" Ripley Rand said. \"The most surprising thing about it,\" he added, was that his great-uncle \"probably never heard anything about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRipley Rand said he plans to attend the Rand family reunion this summer with his father and has updated his great uncle's research to include the story of the black side of the family.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth he and his father say they're looking forward to meeting their cousins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it will be fun to see what the connections are,\" Ripley Rand said. \"There's a whole group of family members who we did not know existed until last year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe revelation has inspired a few jokes among the senator's family and friends. \"I always knew you were one of us,\" an African-American friend told the senator with a nudge and wink.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Rand is also quick to crack a joke about anything from sports and politics to food. Namely chitterlings -- a traditionally Southern delicacy made from pig intestines -- and barbecue pork. A few of the things a \"Yankee\" might not know much about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's an old joke in the South,\" he explained. \"If somebody was cooking chitlins and collards at the same time -- the smell was so strong that the fire would try to break out of the house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA proud member of the Wake County Chitlin Club, a group of politically active men who gather every year at the annual Chitlin Dinner, Tony Rand is proud of his Southern heritage. Calling North Carolina barbecue \"good\" won't do for the senator, who insists his state has the best \"pig pickin.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"North Carolina is a great place, we've got the mountains, we've got good college basketball and we've got good barbecue,\" he said. \"What more could a good person aspire to?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that barbecue is also a tradition at the Rand family reunion, there's already some common ground for the lawmaker and his kin. Even though he's \"expecting to meet some interesting people\" at this year's reunion, he's not expecting much in the way of barbecue \"given that it's in California and all.\"",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- As millions of people enter the job market and business owners struggle to entice consumers, Ryan Taylor may be better positioned than most to weather the economic crisis.\n\n\n\nRyan Taylor, right, and client Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men at Taylor's downtown Los Angeles office.\n\n\n\nTaylor is a custom tailor who brings his showroom to clients' homes and offices.\n\n\n\nThe day before former New Edition artist Johnny Gill left for a U.S. concert tour in March, Taylor sat in the musician's modest condominium taking measurements for a customized shirt and suit that needed to be completed and shipped in a few days.\n\n\n\nEven on short notice, \"Taylor the Tailor,\" as he is known, delivered on his promise -- and made Gill a loyal and satisfied customer.\n\n\n\nTaylor says he wants to change the apparel business model by personalizing a customer's needs, instead of having large inventories and high overhead costs that can quickly put someone out of business in a bad economy. His recipe for success: virtually no inventory and prices competitive with brand name department stores.\n\n\n\nHis story in the apparel business began with the word \"wardrobe\" itself.\n\n\n\n\"I had seen it numerous times and thought, 'Why would a word associated with business suits or casual attire have such a negative prefix?' \" He decided to remove the word \"war\" and create a brand called DROBE that would offer professionals and smaller mom-and-pop boutiques his personalized custom style.\n\n\n\nBut his first foray into the apparel business began and ended about 10 years ago at a trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. He borrowed money to pay for a booth, but like many entrepreneurial designers getting started, Taylor said buyers were not interested in clothing without established brand names. Soon after, Taylor was broke.\n\n\n\n\"When I came home from that show thousands of dollars in the hole, I thought, 'How can I create a better story?' \"  Watch Taylor discuss how his business started \u00bb\n\n\n\nSeveral months later, Taylor was surprised that some of his personal customers were coming back for more shirts because of his attention to size and detail.\n\n\n\n\"I discovered that clothes off the rack fit less than 50 percent of the consumer population,\" he said, \"and that my custom clothes can be generally close to the same price as those on the rack.\"\n\n\n\nHe also began visiting his clients in their living rooms or offices for custom fittings and offering a range of fabrics, textures and designs conducive to an individual's style. When a sale is made, Taylor collects half the money up front, which helps pay for the cost of materials.\n\n\n\n\"Nine times out of 10 we visit clients in their home or offices, we take their measurements right there inside their office, have them select the fabric they prefer, take their measurements right then and there, and [in] a couple weeks have a tailor-made garment to wear,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAlthough he discovered his custom-tailored clients looked great in his shirts, he noticed that most Main Street customers wore pants and suits that did not properly fit, so Taylor saw that as another opportunity to expand.\n\n\n\nWith no inventory and a small staff on commission, Taylor's reputation spread throughout the Los Angeles, Chicago, Illinois, and Atlanta, Georgia, business communities, partly with the help of fellow Hampton University alumni. He said television shows and celebrities began to take notice, and soon he found himself in the fitting rooms of major motion picture and recording studios.\n\n\n\nTaylor told CNN's Ted Rowlands that one of his first clients was the late comedian Bernie Mac. \"I called the Bernie Mac show and the stylist there said come on in and he was my first celebrity client.\"\n\n\n\nSome of his other celebrity clients include Al Pacino, Martin Lawrence, Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel, George Lopez and musician and multi-Grammy winner Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men. But his reputation did not change his business style.\n\n\n\n\"Our business model is remarkably fit and lean,\" he said. \"We have no inventory because our inventory is simply fabric.\"\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of men and women who make up Taylor's clientele earn a living on Main Street, like Brian Asciak, the sales manager of a Ford dealership in Long Beach, California, who became Taylor's most recent customer as he sat in his office.\n\n\n\n\"We eliminate the cost to have your clothes tailored and we eliminate the time it takes to go shopping,\" said Taylor. His business has expanded to include custom-tailored dresses, ties, shoes and accessories.\n\n\n\nWhat began as a small loan has turned into 1,300 loyal clients. He averages close to $30,000 per month in revenue, and sales are down by only about 15 percent this year, he said.\n\n\n\nIn a volatile economic climate, Taylor is not cutting back. He recently opened a second DROBE office in Pasadena, California, and wants to add 200 clients before the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\"To survive in this tough economy,\" he said, \"you have to be willing to customize your product as well as your service for the specific nuances of individual people so they will talk about you with glow -- with a feeling of excitement about your product.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Imagine arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia, one of the busiest and most bustling airports in the country.\n\n\n\nPeople are dashing about, waiting at checkpoints and scanning the screens for departure and arrival times.\n\n\n\nInvariably there are delays and since you aren't going anywhere anytime soon, you might as well enjoy the tunes playing over the public announcement system.\n\n\n\nHey, isn't that the Peaches and Herb classic \"Shake Your Groove Thing\"? You haven't heard that in years!\n\n\n\nBut wait, what are they singing? It sounds like \"Shake Your Groove Thing,\" but the lyrics playing don't match the ones you know. Click on the image above to hear two of the airport's new songs.\n\n\n\n\"Opening Day fresh, Opening Day fresh,\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nHartsfield-Jackson do it now\n\n\n\nOpening Day fresh, Opening Day fresh,\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nShow 'em how we do it now!\n\n\n\nShow 'em how we do it now!\"\n\n\n\nWelcome to parody with a purpose.\n\n\n\nAs part of an initiative to keep the airport clean and get people excited about the airport's new shops and dining options, officials there bought the rights to three popular R & B classics: \"Shake Your Groove Thing\" by Peaches and Herb, \"Bustin' Loose\" by Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers and \"Fantastic Voyage\" by Lakeside.\n\n\n\nWith rights secured, Doug Strachan, Creative Innovations Manager for the City of Atlanta Department of Aviation, rewrote the lyrics and invited the original artists to record the revamped songs.\n\n\n\n\"Whereas words reach the mind, music reaches the heart,\" Strachan said. \"These are hit songs that people love ... real powerful, catchy and make you want to dance. If you can make someone dance, you can probably motivate them to do other things.\"\n\n\n\nSo \"Groove Thing\" became \"Keep It Opening Day Fresh,\" \"Bustin Loose\" morphed into \"We're Steady Cleaning Up,\" and \"Fantastic Voyage\" was reborn as \"Our New Concessions.\" Clean music with a clean message -- literally.\n\n\n\nThe concept of \"opening day fresh\" refers to keeping the airport as clean as if it were opening day, which means smelling fresh and looking as spotless as possible.\n\n\n\nThe catchy tunes are a way to subtly remind visitors that it takes a team effort to keep the airport sparkling. \"Our New Concessions\" reminds travelers about the facility's retail offerings and food service.\n\n\n\nStrachan said much effort was put into making sure the songs were produced in such a way that they were respectful to the song and the artist.\n\n\n\n\"The whole idea is to make it sound as much like the original as possible,\" Strachan said. \"If it's not really done with deft, then it kind of detracts from it rather than enhances it.\"\n\n\n\nHerb Fame, half of Peaches and Herb, loved the idea and was pleased to remake his classic.\n\n\n\n\"Shake Your Grove Thing\" \"was a worldwide song and people recognize the melody,\" said Fame, who continues to perform. \"It was fun to do and every time I come through the airport I listen to it.\"\n\n\n\nMark Wood, lead vocalist of the group Lakeside, said Strachan did a great job transforming \"Fantastic Voyage\" into a new, yet familiar song.\n\n\n\n\"It's important to send the message in a way that the message will get through,\" Wood said. \"Ours is a song that people may have grown up hearing or they may have played for their kids and so you might have generations that can relate to it.\"\n\n\n\nSuch messaging can be extremely effective, said Matt Wallaert, lead scientist for Thrive, an online financial advisory company for young adults.\n\n\n\nWallaert, an expert in behavioral finance and social psychology, said the airport is obviously attempting to do something his company also aims for -- offering useful information in a way that is less stressful for the user.\n\n\n\n\"If you put up a sign that says 'Don't Litter,' people see it the first time you put it up, but every time after that it loses its impact, because it becomes a standard part of what they see,\" he said. \"Music is pervasive in a way that a sign is not because it's everywhere.\"\n\n\n\nStrachan said officials at the airport definitely want those coming through to enjoy their time.\n\n\n\nAs part of that, the airport recently launched the initial phases of a program that uses a scent called \"Breeze\" to help enhance visitors' mood. Strachan said the scent, which was first tested on a limited group of passengers, uses a variety of different notes, including vanilla and a little lavender.\n\n\n\nThe pleasant, relaxing scent is going over so well that Strachan said a custom scent that will be exclusive to Hartsfield-Jackson is being developed.\n\n\n\n\"We want to make people feel better,\" he said. \"We wanted to give them an olfactory cue which suggested that the airport is opening day fresh and we want to enhance their travel experience.\"\n\n\n\nStefanie Michaels, also known as Adventure Girl, is a travel commentator and writer who is a frequent traveler.\n\n\n\nAnything airports can do to make air travel more relaxing is more than welcome, especially in the times we live in, she said.\n\n\n\n\"Movie theaters and restaurants have been using scents and those kinds of subliminal tactics for years,\" Michaels said. \"Music makes people feel good and with the economy the way it is, people are just stressed to no end, so from a subconscious level it's a really wise thing for the airport to do.\"",

Obviously, Summit executives saw the writing on the wall weeks ago and have hired Chris Weitz (\"About a Boy,\" \"American Pie\") to direct next fall's follow-up.\n\n\n\nRounding out the top five are Disney's doggie flick \"Bolt\" with $7.5 million and Baz Luhrmann's underperforming \"Australia\" with $4.3 million.\n\n\n\nThe weekend's other new major release -- \"Nothing Like the Holidays,\" starring John Leguizamo and Debra Messing -- got coal in its stocking with a measly $3.5 million during its first weekend.\n\n\n\nAlso of note is the Clint Eastwood-starring \"Gran Torino\" (rumored to be the actor-director's last turn in front of the camera).\n\n\n\nAlthough it opened in only six theaters (three in New York, three in L.A.), the film scored the best per screen average, $47,333, with a gross of only $284,000.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Capt. Tadeusz Wrona still has trouble sleeping. The night after executing a spectacular belly landing in Poland, the veteran pilot tossed and turned until 4 a.m.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phone kept ringing, he told Polish media, and he kept reliving the chilling moments when his crew and passengers came close to a disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow basking in his nation's adoration and fielding countless interview requests, Wrona is resting even less, he said with a weary smile.\n\n\n\n\n\nWrona, who has worked for LOT Polish Airlines for 20 years, was at the controls of a Boeing 767 en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Warsaw on Tuesday when he realized there was a problem with the landing gear.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the second attempt to open it failed, he knew that everyone on board -- 220 passengers and 11 crew -- was in danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've maybe flown this plane 500 times, and the landing gear deployed every time,\" Wrona said during a news conference in Warsaw on Wednesday. \"I never had any trouble flying Boeing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAware of comparisons to the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson,\" when Capt. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger landed a plane in New York's Hudson River after a flock of geese damaged both of the aircraft's engines, Wrona pointed out that his situation was less dire.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of his engines were working fine and there was time to prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter notifying Warsaw's airport that there might be an emergency landing, the crew had time to perform checks and various functions, Wrona said. They circled the city to burn off excess fuel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the crew reviewed the procedure in the cockpit, the flight attendants prepared the cabin, instructing passengers that they would have to evacuate as soon as the plane stopped on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autopilot helped the crew guide the plane until about two minutes before landing, Wrona said. That's when he took manual control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We rested the plane on three points: two engines plus the rear portion of the fuselage,\" Wrona said. \"We tried to do it delicately, and we were successful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was less noise during the belly landing than a normal touch down, which shocked Wrona. It was just quiet, he recalled.\n\n\n\n\n\nWrona, who has been dubbed the Polish version of Sullenberger, was praised by the original \"miracle\" pilot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The captain and the crew obviously did a great job,\" Sullenberger told CNN. \"It definitely requires skill to do this well, and from all reports and from watching the video, it looked like it was done very, very well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for Wrona, there were still tense moments ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the plane stopped on the runway, I wasn't sure whether everyone was safe, because smoke appeared,\" he recalled. (Wind had blown the smoke caused by the friction of the landing toward the cockpit.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I finally felt full relief only when the purser reported that the cabin was empty.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone got out safe and unhurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Sullenberger, Wrona is now grappling with sudden fame and the gratitude of hundreds of families. He's a Facebook star, with several fan pages established in his honor. One page has more than 33,000 followers leaving messages of praise and adulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Wrona insists it's too much to call him a national hero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am convinced that all of us who work for LOT would do the exact same thing, and it would end in the same way, because we train for such situations on simulators,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWrona is fully prepared to return to his duties as pilot, he said. In fact, his schedule -- prepared before the incident -- has him flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday. He's not sure whether the commission investigating the emergency landing will let him go.\n\n\n\n\n\nWrona's wife and two adult children beamed when they were interviewed by Polish media on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarzena Wrona found out about her husband's troubled flight on television while the plane was still circling Warsaw and raced to the airport to watch the emergency landing, she told the program Dzie\u00c5\u201e Dobry TVN.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she had to turn back when authorities closed off many streets leading to the airport as a safety precaution. When she got back home, the plane had already landed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I knew the landing would be successful because I couldn't imagine otherwise,\" Wrona's wife said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- \"China is not on the Internet, it's basically an intranet. Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,\" says Sherman So, co-author of \"Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution.\"\n\n\n\nSherman So, author of \"Red Wired,\" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture.\n\n\n\nWith 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry.\n\n\n\nChinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English.\n\n\n\nAs the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired her to write \"Red Wired\" was the chasm in online culture on either side of China's carefully controlled borders.\n\n\n\n\"The information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know Chinese and those who are from another part of world and who don't is just so huge,\" observes So.\n\n\n\n\"I've talked to lots of investors, analysts, visitors to Hong Kong, and they really don't know what's happening in China. They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.\n\n\n\nGoogle focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.\n\n\n\nAlthough Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.\n\n\n\nConquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics\n\n\n\nSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?\n\n\n\nWhile 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.\n\n\n\nIn short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.\n\n\n\nOne could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.\n\n\n\nAmong the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nTencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.\n\n\n\n\"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.\n\n\n\n\"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services.\n\n\n\n\"Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers. They don't need efficiency, they come online to kill time, to be entertained, to talk with friends, not to do work.\"\n\n\n\nIn a China where economic growth comes at different speeds, So believes that the Internet has leveled out the playing field.\n\n\n\n\"The online population in China comes from very modest families,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\"Forty percent go online at Internet cafes, which is the cheapest entertainment alternative you can find. It costs just 30 cents per hour. The poorest kid can afford that, and these Internet cafes can be found in the most remote regions.\n\n\n\n\"So actually the Internet is flattening out this information gap, if not material gap, because even the poorest kid in China can go online and get information. And because of piracy, they can also download lots of stuff for free.\"\n\n\n\nSea turtle power\n\n\n\nAnother recurring factor of success among Chinese Internet start-ups is their founders' extensive experience working in Silicon Valley before returning to China to launch their own business.\n\n\n\nA person who has returned to China from overseas is known in Mandarin as \"hai gui,\" which sounds the same as the Mandarin words for \"sea turtle.\" Such entrepreneurial returnees include Baidu's Robin Li, Sohu's Charles Zhang and Ctrip's James Liang.\n\n\n\n\"Sea turtles bring in new ideas,\" says So. \"Like what is a search engine?\"\n\n\n\n\"Robin Li was an engineer with a patent on search mechanism, and he wanted to build a Chinese search engine. He brought in the idea, the technology and the funding. While he was still working for Infoseek in Silicon Valley, he got $1.2 million from former executives of Inktomi. Then he went back to China and recruited students and teachers from Peking University, and he built Baidu in a year.\n\n\n\n\"Finally [the sea turtle CEOs] go to the Nasdaq for IPO listing, because that is where the market really understands the Internet and can appreciate what they did.\"\n\n\n\nLikewise, China is growing from both foreign interaction and the new technological and political challenges of online culture and commerce. As the \"Great Intranet\" continues to expand and evolve, China continues to explore the fragile balance between censorship and control, and enterprise and innovation.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Cyclist Lance Armstrong said Thursday the surgery to repair his broken collarbone proved to be more complex than doctors originally anticipated and that he will take his recovery \"day by day.\"\n\n\n\nCyclist Lance Armstrong needed 12 screws to repair his broken collarbone.\n\n\n\n\"I thought everything went very smooth,\" he said in a video to his supporters about Wednesday's three-hour operation.\n\n\n\nDoctors in Spain, where Armstrong injured himself Monday when he fell during a race, initially thought he had suffered a simple fracture. However, additional X-rays and CT scans in Austin, Texas, where he lives, proved otherwise.\n\n\n\n\"They realized that the collarbone is actually in quite a few pieces,\" said the 37-year-old cyclist, who pointed to an X-ray of a 4- to 5-inch steel plate held in place by a dozen 1-inch screws, intended to stabilize it.\n\n\n\n\"That should keep things together,\" he said. \"Ultimately, that will have to come out, but for now, it's necessary.\"  Watch how Armstrong \"tweets\" from hospital \u00bb\n\n\n\nArmstrong said he felt \"very lucky, very blessed\" that, in almost 20 years of professional cycling, he has rarely crashed.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know how my recovery will go, we'll just take it day by day and ultimately get back on the bike and try to sort things out.\"\n\n\n\nArmstrong's remarks came a day after his surgeon, Dr. Douglas Elenz, told reporters that the cyclist will require two to three months of healing.\n\n\n\nThe four breaks \"made treatment more challenging, but we're confident that the treatment performed today is going to be successful,\" Elenz said.\n\n\n\nDuring the next week, Armstrong \"will need to take it easy\" to ensure the wound does not become infected, the doctor said.\n\n\n\nAfter his wound has healed, Armstrong will begin using an exercise bike to train his lower body, \"but we won't let him do a whole lot with his upper extremities,\" Elenz said. \"After several weeks, we can take his training to the street, but we will need to take that day by day and week by week.\"\n\n\n\nHe said that, over the longer term, he will be looking for evidence that Armstrong is laying down new bone, that the plate is stable, that the athlete's arm is strong and that his motion is fluid.\n\n\n\nArmstrong, riding for Team Astana, crashed about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the end of the first stage of the five-day Vuelta Ciclista a Castilla y Leon race.  Watch Armstrong's crash \u00bb\n\n\n\nArmstrong announced last year that he was returning to competitive biking and would use the Spanish race as a warm-up for the Tour de France, which he won seven times before retiring in 2005.\n\n\n\nHe also had planned to race May 9-31 in the Giro d'Italia, one of Europe's most prestigious and grueling stage races.\n\n\n\nThis would have been the second comeback of his career. His first came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival.",

A federal law enforcement official familiar with the cases said authorities feared word of the Illinois arrest could tip off the Texas suspect of an undercover sting operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a criminal complaint filed with Smadi's arrest, counterterrorism officials said the suspect had been under \"continuous surveillance\" because of oft-stated determination to inflict damage and death against the United States, which he deemed to be an enemy of Islam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The identification and apprehension of this defendant, who was acting alone, is a sobering reminder that there are people among us who want to do us grave harm,\" said James Jacks, the top federal prosecutor in Dallas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter casing a Wells Fargo Bank in the office tower in July, Smadi told an undercover agent he would target the facility, according to authorities. Initially Smadi told the agent he wanted to conduct the bombing on September 11, but decided to wait until Ramadan ended September 20, authorities said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unbeknownst to Smadi, the FBI ensured the [vehicle-borne IED] contained only an inert/inactive explosive device, which contained no explosive materials,\" the Justice Department said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmadi will make his first court appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Dallas on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction carries a potential sentence of up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Department officials said the Dallas case was unrelated to the similar FBI sting in Springfield, Illinois, a day earlier when FBI undercover agents foiled a plot to bomb that city's federal building.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn neither case did authorities find ties to known terrorist groups.",

What are the real objectives or activities -- I don't know. But that is kidnapping and it is more serious because it's involving children,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The children certainly were not fully willing to go, because in some cases, from what I heard, they were asking for their parents, they wanted to return to their parents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHow far should aid workers go?\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. embassy officials visited the Americans over the weekend at a jail near the airport in Port-au-Prince, where they are being detained. They are being treated well and are holding on to their faith, the Americans said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We came into Haiti to help those that really had no other source of help,\" Laura Silsby, a member of the Idaho-based charity, New Life Children's Refuge, told CNN on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are trusting the truth will be revealed and we are praying for that.\"  Full coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group of five men and five women said they were trying to move the children to the Dominican Republic in the aftermath of the January 12 earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti, flattening the capital and killing tens of thousands. But a Haitian judge has charged the 10 with child trafficking, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said Sunday that the Americans have been detained for \"alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"God is our provider and God gives us strength and comfort,\" said Carla Thompson, one group member. \"We have our Bibles and we are OK.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment approval is needed for any Haitian children to leave the country, and the group acknowledged that the children have no passports.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeanne Bernard-Pierre, general director for Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare, said the children will be interviewed in the coming days to determine whether they have living relatives.  Search for the missing\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group said it believed the children were orphaned, and it was going to house them in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Willeit of SOS Children's Villages -- who said that Haitian police and the social ministry brought the children to his group -- said some of the children have living relatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of them for sure are not orphans,\" he told CNN. \"Immediately after she arrived here, a girl -- she might be 9 years old -- was crying loudly, 'I am not an orphan, I do have my parents, please call my parents,' \" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And some of the other kids as well, they have their phone numbers, even, with them from their parents,\" he said. He said he believes that at least 10 are not orphans.\n\n\n\n\n\nMel Coulter, the father of 23-year-old Charisa Coulter, who is among those arrested, told CNN affiliate KTVB that the group thought it had all of the necessary documents to transport the children out of the earthquake-ravaged country, but apparently lacked some paperwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They want to bring kids out who have no home, who have no parents, who have no hope -- and this was an attempt to give them the hope that they've lost in Haiti,\" he said Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group \"went down on Thursday night fully expecting that they had everything they needed, all the documentation that they needed,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they tried to bring some of the kids out [Friday] night they were stopped at the border and [they] said that there was a paper missing,\" he said. \"So they returned to Port-au-Prince, where they went in early [Saturday] morning to try and get the last documentation, and apparently were arrested on the spot and jailed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the group wants \"to do everything according to the processes that are required.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Clint Henry, the senior pastor with Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, where at least some of the group members worship, told KTVB Sunday that the church was hopeful that the group would soon be released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're waiting ... and hoping and praying that that outcome will be the one that we're looking for, so the team that has been falsely charged will be vindicated, and that the whole world is going to know that we weren't here doing the kind of things we're being accused of doing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the accusations have prompted a number of phone calls to the church that include \"obscenities, accusations about those false rumors, things that I don't care to repeat.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe children were being rescued from \"one or more orphanages\" that had been damaged in the quake, a statement on the church's Web site said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry told CNN affiliate KIVI Saturday that the group had been planning to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but that the earthquake sped up the timetable for transporting the Haitian children there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We weren't ready to start this yet, everything was in process,\" he said, and the construction on the orphanage has not yet begun.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the children said they are from Fort Jacques, a town about seven miles from Port-au-Prince, according to Bernard-Pierre.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Karl Penhaul, Jill Dougherty and journalist Jessica Desvarieux contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Melissa Harris-Lacewell is associate professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton University. She is the author of the award-winning book, \"Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political Thought\" and writes a daily blog titled The Kitchen Table.\n\n\n\nMelissa Harris-Lacewell says Eric Holder's speech fell short of calling for real action against racism.\n\n\n\nPRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- On Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder marked Black History Month with an address at the Department of Justice. Holder clearly and courageously acknowledged the history of American racism.\n\n\n\nHe forthrightly argued that, \"to get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul.\" Because public officials so rarely discuss race, Holder's was an unusually bold statement.\n\n\n\nBut ultimately, Eric Holder's discussion of race in America was a failure. It failed because Holder spoke more like a grade school principal than like the attorney general of the United States. He framed our nation's continuing racial work as a struggle to feel comfortable, be tolerant, and have \"frank conversations about racial matters.\"\n\n\n\nI appreciate the sentiment, but I would prefer Holder use the Department of Justice to sue those who illegally discriminate against racial minorities rather than holding encounter sessions in the lunchroom.\n\n\n\nFebruary's celebration of black history is important because it reminds us that America's bitter racial legacy is not about name calling and hurt feelings; it is about structures of inequality codified in law and supported by government action.\n\n\n\nBlack men and women risked their lives to gain the right to vote, to live where they chose, to educate their children in the best public schools, and to end segregation in transportation and public places.\n\n\n\nBlack political history is the story of a battle against structures. Unfortunately, too many of those structures still exist. As attorney general, Eric Holder is charged, in part, with eliminating those violations of law that still create systematic racial inequality.\n\n\n\nIn Holder's optimistic portrayal of modern America, we are a nation fundamentally altered by Brown v. Board of Education; a country that has \"done a pretty good job melding the races in the workplace;\" and a nation whose biggest racial obstacle is making our weekend socializing as congenial as our workweek happy hours.\n\n\n\nMaybe Holder doesn't realize that in many cities and towns the public schools are more segregated today than they were 40 years ago. A recent report from the Chicago Urban League found that African-American children in the city are almost exclusively educated in schools that are more than 85 percent black.\n\n\n\nThese vastly predominantly black schools have fewer resources, fewer extracurricular activities and fewer experienced teachers than their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nChildren from these schools are more likely to drop out or end up incarcerated than to enroll in college.\n\n\n\nSegregation is no longer the law of the land, but America's children continue to be educated in separate and unequal schools. We can't talk our way out of unequal schools.\n\n\n\nHolder's perspective that black and white workers get along easily in the workplace reflects a shocking disregard for contemporary employment realities. African-Americans continue to suffer from extraordinary employment discrimination at every stage of hiring and promotion and in every sector of the job market.\n\n\n\nFor example, my Princeton University colleague, sociologist Devah Pager, has demonstrated that white men with criminal records are more likely to be considered for a job than black men with no criminal past.\n\n\n\nI am deeply concerned that the leader of the Department of Justice seems to believe that our workplaces need dialogue, discourse, and understanding rather than fair hiring practices, equal pay, and transparent promotion procedures. We can't talk our way out of employers who refuse to interview a job candidate if the name on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \"sounds black.\"\n\n\n\nHolder discussed weekend segregation as if it is just a matter of personal recreational choice: White folks go off to NASCAR and black people prefer to watch basketball. But the reason Americans do not share racial vocabulary or opportunities for interracial dialogue is because of deeply entrenched racial residential segregation.\n\n\n\nWe don't spend our weekends together because we don't live in the same neighborhoods. Housing segregation is not just a matter of personal choice. Some real estate agents steer black families away from predominantly white neighborhoods. Some property owners refuse to rent to black families. Both of these acts are illegal.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the National Fair Housing Alliance documents hundred of thousands of acts of housing discrimination each year and has repeatedly criticized the Department of Justice for failing to adequately pursue and prosecute the vast majority of these cases. We can't talk our way out of residential segregation.\n\n\n\nAs a teacher, I am deeply committed to interracial dialogue. I try to use my classroom as a site of conversation, deliberation, and debate about race. I do this because, as a teacher, dialogue is the most powerful weapon I have in the fight to build a better America.\n\n\n\nEric Holder has something more. He has the law. I don't want my attorney general to scold me about having conversations; I want him to tell me the lawsuits he plans to file against those who continue to practice educational, employment, and housing discrimination.\n\n\n\nI appreciate Attorney General Holder for taking up a conversation on race, but it is not enough. The time for talking may come, but today is a day for action.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Harris-Lacewell.",

  "context": "Paris, France (CNN)  -- The future of social networking, the real-time Web and a host of apps and gadgets were the talk of the annual Le Web conference as it opened here Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phenomenal success of microblogging site Twitter and its plans for the future dominated the two-day event's opening sessions for bloggers and industry leaders, held in a converted morgue in the city's northeastern suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop executives from Twitter faced off with rivals from Facebook and MySpace as all three social media sites unveiled technical innovations designed to capture more users.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the heels of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's unveiling of Square, a device that accepts credit card payments on cell phones, Twitter platform director Ryan Sarver said the site now has 50,000 dedicated applications making use of its constant stream of blog updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarver also announced the company's \"firehose\" feature, which throws open its data stream to any developers who want to use it. This is a first for Twitter, which has yet to disclose any major revenue streams even as others use it to harvest profits.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook developer Ethan Beard touted his own site's 500,000 applications and its power to drastically boost hits to news sites such as The Huffington Post through the 60 million users it now claims for its Facebook Connect feature.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, MySpace Chief Operating Officer Mike Jones announced that his site is incorporating real-time status updates to its platform -- like Twitter and Facebook -- amid MySpace's struggles to find an identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nJones also announced unrestricted developer access to MySpace's content and a $50,000 innovation prize to attract developers, but refused to comment on rumors of a potential partnership with rival Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe social networking execs declined to discuss their sites' revenues or widely rumored stock market flotations.\n\n\n\n\n\nChad Hurley, co-founder of Google-owned YouTube, also refused to disclose company revenues but said some popular users have earned more than $1 million since advertising was introduced to the video-sharing site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't implement [advertising] initially on YouTube because we didn't want to skew the motivation of why someone would publish video. We wanted to be a video community,\" he told the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We saw over time the opportunity to introduce that secure revenue without distorting what we've become, and we've been quite successful,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Hurley said he had no secret formula for anyone wanting to create a viral sensation on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could punch me in the face right now, that would get a lot of views,\" he joked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Something shocking will get a lot of views, but there's no magic recipe. That's not really what the site is about -- to define the secret ingredient to get the hits. It's about celebrating the fact that everyone has a chance to participate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the sidelines of Le Web, the chatter was focused on the Facebook vs. Twitter battle and the opening of data streams to app developers. Attendees also wondered aloud about the fickle and unpredictable nature of Internet success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is interesting that everybody now is announcing awards and conferences, but what's next?\" said delegate Katrin Weber of Deutsche Telekom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the end, who is going to win? People are also asking what the formula for success is -- why do some applications or platforms succeed, and why do some fail?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media marketing agent Vero Pepperrell said, \"I'm pleased that Twitter is starting to acknowledge how much of an ecosystem it has with its developers, so on that level, they are doing the right thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogger Gabriel Jorby believes that Square, Dorsey's credit card gadget, represents a new trend that's likely to shape the future for people trying to profit from the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today, if you want to run a service, you need something to bring the physical world. You cannot depend only on an online application, you need to do something tangible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is the future, it is not only [about] the screen experience, it is about something more physical. People need to be producing more than just apps.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2,000 participants from 46 countries were expected in Paris for the Le Web conference, one of Europe's largest annual tech events.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic intends to skip the start of his war crimes trial because he says he has had too little time to prepare, a spokeswoman for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said Thursday.\n\n\n\nRadovan Karadzic wrote to the court to say he would not attend the trial.\n\n\n\nThe trial is still expected to begin on Monday despite Karadzic's intended absence, which he announced in a letter to the court, the spokeswoman said.\n\n\n\n\"The tribunal judges control court proceedings. They are the only relevant body that can make a decision about the readiness of the case for trial,\" she said.\n\n\n\nKaradzic, who is defending himself, faces genocide charges and nine other counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity against Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats and other non-Serbian civilians during the brutal and bloody dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.\n\n\n\nThe conflict introduced the phrase \"ethnic cleansing\" into the lexicon describing war crimes, as different factions in multi-ethnic Yugoslavia sought to kill or drive out other groups.\n\n\n\nKaradzic was arrested last year after more than a decade on the run and was found to have been living in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, and practicing alternative medicine in disguise.\n\n\n\nIn a letter dated Wednesday and made public Thursday, Karadzic complains that he has not been given the relevant case material on time -- and he says the volume of material would have been too much to go through even if he had received it promptly.\n\n\n\n\"I ask Your Excellencies -- why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to literally bury me under a million of pages, only to start disclosing relevant material many months after my arrest?\" he writes. \"Why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to file its final indictment against me on the eve of the planned trial date?\"\n\n\n\nKaradzic says he should not be penalized for representing himself.\n\n\n\n\"No lawyer in this world could prepare defense within this period of time,\" he writes. \"I hereby inform you that my defense is not ready for my trial that is supposed to begin as scheduled, on the 26th of October, and that therefore I shall not appear before you on that date.\"\n\n\n\nHe promised to continue his preparations in \"the most intensive way\" and inform the court when he is ready.\n\n\n\nThe genocide charges against him stem partly from the most notorious massacre of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, once a part of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n\nMore than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed at Srebrenica when ethnic Serb troops overran a U.N. \"safe area\" in July 1995. It was the worst European massacre since World War II.\n\n\n\nProsecutors at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague accuse Karadzic of responsibility.\n\n\n\n\"On 8 March 1995, Karadzic instructed Bosnian Serb forces under his command to create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival for the inhabitants of Srebrenica, amongst other places,\" the tribunal said in a statement this month.\n\n\n\nThe Hague indictment also says Karadzic committed genocide when forces under his command killed non-Serbs during and after attacks in more than a dozen Bosnian municipalities in the early stages of the war.\n\n\n\nKaradzic, who faces life in prison if he is convicted, denies the charges. The court cannot impose the death penalty.\n\n\n\nWhen he was arrested in July 2008, Karadzic had grown a large white beard and let his famous steel-gray hair grow long and turn white. He had spent more than 13 years in hiding, during which he practiced alternative medicine at a Belgrade clinic.\n\n\n\nKaradzic's arrest leaves his former military commander, Ratko Mladic, as the highest-ranking fugitive still being sought by the war crimes tribunal.\n\n\n\nProsecutor Alan Tieger told the court in July that the case against Karadzic would take approximately 490 hours. That means prosecutors are likely to need more than a year to lay out their evidence, a court spokeswoman said.\n\n\n\nThe 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations.\n\n\n\nKaradzic was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office.\n\n\n\nMilosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The reaction to Kanye West's hijacking of the microphone from Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards came quickly and unequivocally.\n\n\n\nKanye West took the microphone from Taylor Swift during her speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n\n\nCelebrities and fans alike expressed their disapproval of West interrupting Swift's win for Best Female Video to tout his appreciation of nominee Beyonce.\n\n\n\n\"Taylor, I'm really happy for you,\" West said after grabbing the microphone from a clearly stunned Swift. \"I'll let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!\"\n\n\n\nElliott Wilson, founder and chief executive officer of Rap Radar, sat in front of members of West's entourage at the live Sunday night awards show and said the mood quickly turned from one of surprised amusement to anger.  Watch West grab the microphone from Swift \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"At first, people weren't sure if it was kind of like a gag,\" Wilson said. \"You could feel everybody being nervous and not knowing if it was a prank or something. Then people started booing him really loud.\"\n\n\n\nWilson said he believes that West -- who he said bounded on stage from his seat in the front row near Beyonce -- intended to have his say before allowing Swift to continue but said the rapper became angered by the crowd response in a moment that wasn't captured by the MTV cameras.\n\n\n\n\"The reaction to his tantrum was so strong ... and what happened was, he gave everybody the finger,\" Wilson said.\n\n\n\nStars taking to Twitter returned the sentiment with some harsh words for the sometimes mercurial rap star.\n\n\n\nSinger Pink tweeted, \"Kanye West is the biggest piece of [expletive] on earth. Quote me,\" and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte tweeted, \"All i'm saying is Taylor Swift is a young chic and you just walk up and grab the mic.\"\n\n\n\nCelebrity blogger Perez Hilton said via Twitter that \"Taylor Swift deserved that award, damnit. It is what THE PEOPLE voted! My heart broke for her, she looked so sad at the end of that moment.\"\n\n\n\nSinger Katy Perry weighed in with \"F--- u Kanye. It's like you stepped on a kitten.\"\n\n\n\nVMA nominee Kelly Clarkson took to her blog to publish an open letter to West. \"What happened to you as a child?? Did you not get hugged enough??\" she asked.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, \"Taylor Swift,\" \"VMAs,\" \"Kanye's\" and \"Beyonce\" were top trending topics on Twitter.  Watch Swift respond to what happened \u00bb\n\n\n\nWilson, a noted hip-hop journalist, said there was a great deal of tension inside the event Sunday night before West and his girlfriend, model Amber Rose, left the show.\n\n\n\n\"It was almost like wrestling, when the good guy turns bad and the crowd turns on him,\" Wilson said. \"Every time his name was mentioned, people booed.\"\n\n\n\nWilson said he believes that alcohol may have played a part in West's actions, given that the rapper appeared both on the red carpet and inside the arena with a bottle of cognac.\n\n\n\nWilson added that West is well known for such behavior. He appeared uninvited onstage at the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards, walked out of the 2004 American Music Awards after losing in the Best New Artist category and reportedly threw a backstage tantrum at the 2007 VMAs because he did not perform on the main stage.\n\n\n\n\"I think Kanye came in to be the bad boy, but he obviously had an emotional spaz moment because he is cool\" with Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z, Wilson said. \"I think the alcohol blurred his judgment.\"\n\n\n\nWilson said attendees at the awards show were allowed to have drinks at their seats.\n\n\n\nEmil Wilbekin, managing editor of Essence.com, said West may have gone too far with his antics this time.\n\n\n\n\"I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyonce or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment,\" Wilbekin said. \"It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people.\"\n\n\n\nThough West is known for having a healthy ego, Wilbekin said, his actions may be damaging the very legacy the rapper claims to want to leave.\n\n\n\n\"He's talked about wanting to be Elvis; he's talked about wanting to be the new king of pop,\" Wilbekin said. \"It's almost like he's overshadowing himself by getting in his own way with his mouth.\"\n\n\n\nWest apologized to Swift via his blog.\n\n\n\nAs for Swift, the young singer gave her acceptance speech after Beyonce graciously invited her onstage during her win for Video of the Year.\n\n\n\nWest's disruption wasn't the only one the evening offered, Wilson said. During a performance by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, rapper Lil Mama rushed the stage.\n\n\n\nWilson said that from his vantage point in the audience, the female rapper, who also serves as a judge on MTV's \"America's Best Dance Crew,\" was neither expected nor wanted as part of the performance. iReport: Is civility dead?\n\n\n\nThe stars' behavior might have long-lasting consequences, Wilson added.\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if MTV banned alcohol [at the event] next year,\" he said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution.\n\n\n\nThis image shows the fossilized skeleton of Darwinopterus which was found in north-east China earlier this year.\n\n\n\nThe fossils were found in northeast China earlier this year, embedded in rock dating back 160 million years, and have been called \"Darwinopterus\" after the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin.\n\n\n\nThe creature's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long-tailed forms and advanced short-tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both.\n\n\n\nThe combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly, and that certain groups of features changed at the same time.\n\n\n\nTraditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time.\n\n\n\n\"Darwinopterus came as quite a shock to us,\" said David Unwin, from the University of Leicester's School of Museum Studies, which identified the creature, along with researchers from the Geological Institute of Beijing.\n\n\n\n\"We had always expected a gap-filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs, while the rest of the skeleton, including a very long tail, is identical to that of primitive forms,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBy comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods, scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl's progression.\n\n\n\n\"The head and neck evolved first, followed later by the body, tail, wings and legs,\" Unwin said.\n\n\n\nThe researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly, and that whole parts of a plant or animal's body could change at once.\n\n\n\nThe fossils indicate Darwinopterus was about the size of a crow, with long jaws, sharp, pointed teeth and a flexible neck.\n\n\n\nIt had \"hawk-like\" qualities, scientists say, which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller, feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds.\n\n\n\nPterodactyls were prevalent during the Mesozoic Era between 220 and 65 million years ago.\n\n\n\nThe research has been published in the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.\"",

William Diehl told CNN.\n\n\n\nThe missing sailor has been identified by the university as Roger Stone, the vessel's second safety officer.\n\n\n\nThe sailboat, named Cynthia Woods, was one of about two dozen boats heading from Galveston, Texas, to Veracruz, Mexico, for the annual Veracruz Regatta race, which began on Friday.\n\n\n\nDiehl said the boat was well-stocked with safety equipment -- including emergency radio beacons, life rafts and ring buoys -- but the crew could only manage to find four life jackets after the boat tipped over.\n\n\n\n\"The survivors told us that [when] they went into the water, they had four life jackets among the five, and they huddled together and they exchanged the life jacket among them so that they could stay afloat,\" Diehl said.\n\n\n\nCommunication with the boat was lost about midnight Friday, and the boat missed its 8 a.m. radio check the next morning, the Coast Guard reported.\n\n\n\nA sailboat matching the description of the missing 38-foot boat was found overturned about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe five survivors were found several hours later, lifted to safety by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter around 1 a.m. and taken to University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for treatment.\n\n\n\nA Coast Guard spokeswoman could not say exactly where the survivors were rescued, but said the search was focused on an area about 10 miles south of Matagorda, Texas.\n\n\n\nDiehl said a Marine Corps C-130, a Coast Guard cutter and a man-of-war naval vessel are searching for the missing crew member. All the mariners were experienced sailors, he said.\n\n\n\n\"They were very well trained,\" Diehl said. \"Obviously [they were] the more senior cadets at the university here, and they had very experienced safety people on board.\"\n\n\n\nWhen rescuers retrieved the capsized boat's hull, Diehl said the keel was missing.\n\n\n\n\"That's the part that keeps the sailboat balanced in the water,\" he said. \"And from talking to the survivors this morning, that's where the flooding started for them.\"\n\n\n\nThe 725-mile Veracruz regatta began on Friday and boats are expected to arrive in Veracruz on Wednesday and Thursday.",

The United States, the United Nations, the European Union and India have called for a cease-fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, India's foreign secretary and national security adviser met with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to express their concerns about the situation in the north, including casualties among civilians. India has a large Tamil population that sympathizes with the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foreign ministers of two nations are due in Sri Lanka on Wednesday -- David Miliband of the United Kingdom and Bernard Kouchner of France.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Bildt of Sweden was originally scheduled to make the trip with his counterparts, but was not granted a visa, so he was forced to cancel, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. In what amounts to a diplomatic protest, Sweden will recall its ambassador to Sri Lanka for consultations.\n\n\n\n\n\nA government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed a week ago. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country's northeastern coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment troops say they have rescued some 40,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of \"fresh displacement\" now exceeds 100,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sri Lankan military says up to 20,000 civilians continue to be held hostage by Tamil \"terrorists,\" adding that its forces will continue humanitarian operations to rescue them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty metric tons of relief supplies -- which landed in Colombo on Monday -- will be sent by UNICEF to the north to help displaced residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNICEF, which called the situation in the north a \"catastrophe for children,\" said the displaced lack food, water and basic medical supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rebels estimate the number of civilians still in the territory at more than 160,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n-- CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this story.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- The chairman of India's UB Group, which includes Bangalore-based Kingfisher Airlines and United Breweries, made the winning $1.8 million bid on a number of Mahatma Gandhi's personal items on auction.\n\nMahatma Gandhi was known for his peaceful opposition to tyranny, which led to India's independence.\n\nVijay Mallya was expected to return the items to the Indian government, according to CNN-IBN, CNN's sister station in India.\n\nControversy surrounded the sale Thursday of Gandhi's items -- among them his metal-rimmed glasses, pocket watch, sandals, bowl and plate -- prompting the seller, James Otis, to ask that the items be withdrawn from the auction.\n\nIndia voiced strong objections to the auction. Its Ministry of External Affairs said the bidding would \"commercialize and thereby demean the memory of the Father of the Nation and everything that he stood for in his life, beliefs and actions.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a New Delhi court issued an injunction to stop the sale.  Watch the auction stoke high interest \u00bb\n\nBut the Antiquorum auction house in Manhattan went ahead with the auction as scheduled.\n\nThe Indian government had rejected an offer from Otis, who had asked the Indian government to expand its spending on the poor in exchange for the items.\n\nIndia's government already spends a large amount of money on the country's disadvantaged sectors, India's culture minister Ambika Soni told reporters Thursday.\n\nStill, the government had hoped Otis would not allow the public to bid on the items.\n\nSoni, the culture minister, said that India's government exercised several options to stop the auction at the Antiquorum in New York.\n\nGandhi, who waged a long struggle against British rule in India, was assassinated in New Delhi by a Hindu fanatic on January 30, 1948. He is still widely revered for his insistence on non-violent protest to achieve political and social progress.\n\nMany Indians believe selling Gandhi's items for profit is outrageous.\n\n\"I feel very sad about it because Gandhi himself never believed in private possessions,\" said Varsha Das, director of India's National Gandhi Museum, using a term of endearment for Gandhi. \"He gave away everything. He did not even have a home to live in.\"\n\nCNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(LifeWire)  -- Practicing the clarinet may be beyond tedious for teenagers forced into music lessons by their parents but for 70-year-old Joe Pedlosky it's a labor of love.\n\n\n\nSaxophonist Jerry Hendricks from Olympia, Washington, practices in Cambria, California, in March 2006\n\n\n\n\"From the time I was a little kid, I always wanted to play clarinet,\" says Pedlosky, a retired scientist in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. \"But we didn't have the money. Then ... I decided it was now or never.\"\n\n\n\nPedlosky, who plays with a local band, is one of many seniors picking up a musical instrument late in life. Many can thank New Horizons International Music Association, which sponsors senior bands and orchestras in the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\nThe group was founded by Roy Ernst, professor emeritus at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. When he formed the first senior-only band in 1991, it was a radical notion.\n\n\n\n\"It was widely believed that the window of opportunity for learning music was childhood,\" Ernst says. \"If you didn't learn then, you missed your chance.\"\n\n\n\nThe senior bands prove otherwise. As a matter of fact, these novice musicians give new meaning to the conductor's command, \"Once more, with feeling.\"\n\n\n\n\"I remember conducting at a senior band camp in California, and we played an arioso by Bach,\" recalls Ernst. \"The second time through, two people were crying, they were so touched by the music.\n\n\n\n\"High school kids could never do what we do, because they haven't lived enough, they haven't seen enough joy or sorrow. We have a special ability to play music expressively and with feeling.\"\n\n\n\nErnst, who sometimes refers to himself as the Johnny Appleseed of senior bands, made it his goal to bring seniors to music. From just one band in Rochester, New Horizons has grown to more than a hundred bands, plus offshoots from brass quintets to swing ensembles.\n\n\n\nMusic for body and soul\n\n\n\nErnst's passion moved Professor Don Coffman of the University of Iowa to create his own senior band -- and to conduct research into how music can benefit older musicians. His findings: Benefits include social, emotional, physical and even spiritual growth. In part, Coffman found, seniors benefit from being part of a group that works together toward a significant goal. Other plusses can include better ability to focus, increased lung capacity and improved fine motor skills.\n\n\n\nDinny Stamp would agree. She'd played trombone in high school; after retiring, she attended a performance of Coffman's Iowa City band and thought, \"I can do that!\" Playing in the band \"has been one of the most rewarding experiences of not only my retirement, but my life,\" says Stamp, who turns 78 this month. \"It's a joy to make wonderful music with new friends and to share this music with the community.\"\n\n\n\nJudy Schroeder, 62, another member of the Iowa City band, took up the oboe about three months before retirement. \"I find that playing music really keeps your mind agile ... and our band director wants to challenge us to do well, think hard, try hard. It's just so much fun.\" She's enjoying herself so much that she has taken up the bassoon as well.\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\n\nIf you're interested in getting involved with instrumental music, look for a band in your area on the New Horizons Web site.\n\n\n\nIf there's no senior band available, or if you're interested in learning on your own, most teachers are willing to take on an older student. Pedlosky advises searching for the right kind of person so you're not quickly turned off.\n\n\n\n\"It's important, if you're going to start cold, to really find a good teacher -- someone who sets standards for you but is also mature enough to understand that it's unusual for an older person to take up something about which they know nothing.\"\n\n\n\nThere are real differences between younger and older learners.\n\n\n\n\"Adults are often more analytical about their learning and more persistent, so some display more rapid growth than would a 10-year-old beginner,\" Coffman explains. \"On the other hand, the physical demands of some instruments may lead to a plateauing effect for adults.\" Some seniors, for example, may not be able to sustain high notes on a trumpet.\n\n\n\nWhich instrument should you choose? If you've always had a passion for one instrument, Ernst says, go with your heart. But if you're not sure, ask for suggestions from the band director.\n\n\n\n\"If the group doesn't have a tuba player, you'd be quite the hero if you became one,\" he says.\n\n\n\nWho knows? You might even become a bit of a hero to yourself.\n\n\n\n\"Music is so demanding and compelling that once you start playing, everything else flies out the window,\" Pedlosky says. \"It gives you a deeper appreciation of music and musicians. And sometimes my music sounds really good to me, and that's wonderful.\"\n\n\n\nRoy Ernst: Saxophonist Jerry Hendricks from Olympia, Washington, practices with other band members at a New Horizons band camp in Cambria, California, in March 2006. Many of the musicians did not take up an instrument until retirement. Jon Beringer: Dinny Stamp, 78, played the trombone in high school. She took it up again when she joined a senior band in Iowa City, Iowa. E-mail to a friend\n\n\n\nLifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

  "context": "(CNN) -- A firefighter in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was arrested Monday in connection with two recent arson incidents, authorities said.\n\n\n\nCoatesville has recorded more than 20 arson cases in 2009. Robert Tracey is held in two of the fires.\n\n\n\nRobert Tracey, 37, was taken into custody Monday afternoon for allegedly setting two fires Friday night, Chester County District Attorney Joe Carroll said.\n\n\n\nCoatesville has been hit by a string of arsons in recent months and although the arson task force investigating those cases made Monday's arrest, officials did not link the arrest to any other arson cases.\n\n\n\nThe criminal complaint against Tracey lists nine charges stemming from a fire set to a homeowner's porch swing and a fire set in another homeowner's trash can. The fires, both Friday night, were extinguished before any serious damage was done, authorities said. No injuries were reported.\n\n\n\nCarroll said eyewitness accounts, including descriptions of the suspect's clothes, helped lead to the arrest.\n\n\n\nCarroll said the arrest of a firefighter was \"extremely troubling.\" He said the arson task force is working diligently to solve the arson cases and that \"there is no more important investigation\" to his office.\n\n\n\nOn January 23, Tracey, who was then an assistant chief of volunteer firefighters in Coatesville, told CNN affiliate WPVI that fighting multiple fires was \"really taxing the fire department.\" Tracey recently became a paid firefighter with the department, according to Carroll.\n\n\n\nTracey was jailed with bond set at $2 million, Carroll said. He is expected to be arraigned March 30, according to Carroll. Tracey is the third person arrested this year in connection with arsons in Coatesville, which has recorded more than 20 arson cases so far in 2009.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit alleging that civilian American interrogators subjected Iraqis to torture and severe mistreatment at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad can move forward, a federal judge ruled Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetainees leave Baghdad Central Prison -- also known as Abu Ghraib -- in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected claims by defense contractor CACI that the company was immune from accountability over claims of physical abuse, war crimes and civil conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nReports of torture and humiliation by soldiers and civilian contractors against Iraqi detainees created a political, diplomatic and public relations nightmare for the Bush administration in the months and years after the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Iraqi detainees have sued in U.S. federal courts, alleging contract interrogators assigned to the Baghdad Central Prison -- known as Abu Ghraib -- subjected them to beatings and mental abuse, then destroyed documents and video evidence and later misled officials about what was happening inside the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven U.S. soldiers who also worked at the prison were court-martialed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for prisoner abuse, and several implicated company workers in similar crimes. No contractors have yet faced criminal charges in the wake of the scandal, however.\n\n\n\n\n\nArlington, Virginia-based CACI said it was merely providing contracting services the government required, and that sensitive political and policy questions could not be brought up in any civilian trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge disagreed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While it is true that the events at Abu Ghraib pose an embarrassment to this country, it is the misconduct alleged and not the litigation surrounding that misconduct that creates the embarrassment,\" Lee wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This court finds that the only potential for embarrassment would be if the court declined to hear these claims on political questions grounds. Consequently, the court holds that plaintiffs' claims pose no political question and are therefore justiciable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four Abu Ghraib detainees, led by Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari, were released between 2004 and 2008, and were never charged with a crime, said their attorneys. They were represented in their civil suit by the Center for Constitutional Rights and other individual lawyers. Other Iraqi civilian lawsuits are pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Private military contractors like CACI cannot act with impunity,\" said the center's Katherine Gallagher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They must act within the bounds of law and must be held accountable for their participation in the atrocities at Abu Ghraib and the other facilities in Iraq. We believe their actions and the acts of torture of their employees clearly violated the Geneva Conventions, the Army Field Manual and the laws of the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case is Al Shimari v. CACI Premier Technology Inc., 1:08cv827. There is no word on when the case might go to trial; it could also be settled out of court.",

  "context": "COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- Actress Connie Nielsen hit the big time when she starred in \"Gladiator\" as Lucilla, sister of the deranged Emperor Commodus. Since then she has appeared in hit movies including \"One Hour Photo\" and \"The Hunted\".\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen has always refused to play the Hollywood fame game.\n\n\n\nBut Nielsen has refused to play the Hollywood fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies, including \"The Situation\", about the current Iraq war, and \"Battle in Seattle\", about the anti-globalization riots that took place in Seattle in 1999.\n\n\n\nNielsen now lives in the US and returns to Copenhagen every year. She talks to My City, My Life about what makes the city, and its people, so special.\n\n\n\nCNN: How do you define yourself?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business. I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth. That's what I want from my art, that's what I aspire to.\n\n\n\nI try to combine my work with my family, that's what I aspire to. I don't say that's the only thing. It's not all work and family, because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things.\n\n\n\nCNN: The people here are supposed to be incredibly happy -- what do you think?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: I think it's funny in a way because when I grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word \"happiness\". If you asked somebody, \"what do you wish for in life?\" they wouldn't say \"happiness.\"\n\n\n\nI would have answered \"excitement, knowledge,\" God knows -- I mean, many, many different things, but certainly not \"happiness\". It seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular. And I think that a lot of Danes kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world.\n\n\n\nCNN: Is there anything you'd like to change about the city?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. It's specific to any big city. There was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely, and their social problems. They are still around in New York, Paris, London and here too.\n\n\n\nSo if I could change anything about Copenhagen, or any other major big city, I would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems.\n\n\n\nCNN: Is the city politically driven?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics. People discuss politics at the table. I think some of the first information I received was politically charged (laughs). It was at a time when girls were being told, \"Why don't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper? Why don't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean?\" in school.\n\n\n\nIt was to make us conscious of what we were, how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another. Have you searched through the truth of that concept? Have you deconstructed? Have you made sure that its foundations are valid? That's how I grew up and I think it was wonderful.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you describe the city architecturally?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: It's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here. It's that, intermixed with pure Danish modernism. I love the juxtaposition of it all. I love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well.\n\n\n\nCNN: A lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic, do you think there is a fairy tale quality to Copenhagen?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: An alternative society ... yes I do, I do feel that. I do feel that most things are possible here. I can dream here. I can imagine.\n\n\n\nCNN: What is it about the city that makes people creative?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: Well, we have a very, very long winter and it gets a little boring, so you better think of something to do! It can get deathly boring, so you start using your imagination. Sometimes it's necessity that produces it, because you need to do something.\n\n\n\nCNN: Is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: I think so -- I think we're an idealistic people. I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you take any inspiration from the city?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: Yes, yes I do. Whenever I come back here I remember that I want to write poetry (laughs). I want to take more time to sit and paint some more. I want to do so many more things whenever I come back -- I'm always reminded of that when I come here.\n\n\n\nCNN: You've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do. Why is Copenhagen special to you?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: I was born here and it's the capital of my home country. It's also immensely beautiful. Many of my friends live here and much of my partner's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year.\n\n\n\nIt holds all the museums that hold our history, our culture, and I take our children there and I go there for my own pleasure all the time. I love going to museums.\n\n\n\nI love this city and I love cities that are on the water. I love the water element, specifically the sea. I grew up on the sea and I grew up sailing -- I love sailing -- and the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that I absolutely adore.\n\n\n\nCNN: It seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence.\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: Yes, it's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas. There's a lot of traffic through this place, from the east, west, north and south. And we are the southern part of the north, so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north, and the opposite. And it has left its mark.\n\n\n\nWe are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again, but it also springs from here. It's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too.\n\n\n\nCNN: If Copenhagen was a person, how would you describe it?\n\n\n\nConnie Nielsen: If Copenhagen were a person, that person would be generous, beautiful, elderly, but with a flair. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people.",

  "context": "LONDON, (England) CNN -- Natalia Vodianova is best known as the supermodel who has graced the cover of Vogue, walked the catwalk for the likes of Chanel and Versace.\n\n\n\nSupermodel Natalia Vodianova's charity plans to build hundreds of play parks for children in her native Russia.\n\n\n\nBut Vodianova has a dream that couldn't be further from the glitzy world of fashion -- to build 500 play parks in her native Russia.\n\n\n\nVodianova, born and raised in Russia, was in the country during the 2004 Beslan school siege, in which at least 339 hostages, around half of them children, were killed.\n\n\n\nDeeply affected by the tragedy she returned to New York, where she was living at the time, determined to do something to help the surviving children.\n\n\n\nVodianova organized a fundraising event that generated $350,000 to build the children a playground and she founded her charity, the \"Naked Heart Foundation.\"\n\n\n\nWith an ethos that play is not only therapeutic for children, but a necessity, the foundation aims to provide playgrounds for Russia's urban youth. So far the charity has built 23 playgrounds around the country, starting in her home town of Nizhnii Novgorod, and there are 15 more in the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\"For me, since I started my charity, it has been a very different way of life,\" Vodianova told CNN.  Watch Vodianova take CNN around Moscow \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Giving back just feels so great. I always try to open each play park with myself present for the children, because it makes it more special for them. I go to very remote parts of Russia are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love.\"\n\n\n\nFor Vodianova, this is just the start. She told CNN that her dream is to build 500 play parks in Russia.\n\n\n\nThe charity's play parks can cost anywhere between $27,000 and $400,000, depending on their size and range of play equipment. Vodianova admits, \"It's a big dream -- an expensive one!\"\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to fundraising, Vodianova's secret weapon is her connections in the fashion world. Last year she organized a \"Love Ball\" in Moscow -- a Valentine's Day fundraiser that counted among the guests the likes of designer Valentino, actress Lucy Liu, singer Natalie Imbruglia, and supermodel Eva Herzigova.  See photos of \"The Love Ball.\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe event was held in a former royal residence, Moscow's 16th century Tsaritsino Estate. It featured an ice palace made from 220 tons of ice and music provided by British band Razorlight, among others.\n\n\n\nThe highlight was a Valentine's-themed auction, with lots including a private performance from rock star Bryan Adams, bought for $120,000, and a painting by British artist Damien Hirst called \"Love is All Around,\" which sold for $1.6 million. The auction alone raised $6.7 million for the charity.\n\n\n\nVodianova admits that the global economic crisis is making it harder to get sponsorship for this year's event and says it will be more low-key than last year.\n\n\n\n\"We are not going to make it a very extravagant event; it's very disrespectful of what's going on in the world right now, with the recession and a lot of people losing their jobs.\n\n\n\n\"We're not gong to spend a lot of money on it, but it's important to keep going,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n\nWith a husband and three young children, Vodianova says it can be hard to divide her time between family, career and her charity.\n\n\n\nShe describes her charity work as a 24-hour job. \"I feel a huge sense of responsibility for my foundation because it's really very important to me. Somehow it became my most difficult baby to raise,\" she says.\n\n\n\nBut she has no doubt about the value of her work, both for Russia's children and herself.\n\n\n\n\"The biggest thing I can do for my soul is to hear that laughter and to see all these children that come and play on the play parks that my foundation built.\"\n\n\n\nCNN Producer Deborah Rivers contributed to this report",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Diprivan is a powerful I.V. anesthetic drug used for patients undergoing certain surgeries and diagnostic procedures.\n\n\n\nPatients undergoing surgery may receive Diprivan to keep them sedated during the procedure.\n\n\n\nThe drug is making headlines with the claim from a nurse who worked for pop icon Michael Jackson that the singer, who died June 25, had repeatedly asked her about the drug. Nurse Cherilyn Lee told CNN that Jackson had brought up Diprivan about three months ago, saying he needed it for insomnia and that his doctor said it was safe.\n\n\n\n\"He said, 'I am so sleepy. I cannot sleep. I want to have at least eight hours of sleep,'\" Lee told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\n\n\n\nThe medication, whose generic name is propofol, renders the patient unconscious for as long as doctors deem necessary. The patient wakes up almost immediately after the infusion is stopped, experts say.\n\n\n\nBut treating sleep disorders is not an approved use of the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says Diprivan should be given only by people trained in the administration of general anesthesia and who are not involved in the conduct of the surgery or diagnostic procedure.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain when and how propofol (Diprivan) is used \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe general anesthetic has the effect of making patients feel well-rested when they wake up from it, said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists.\n\n\n\nVila gives the drug to all of his patients who are getting office procedures in areas such as urology, dentistry and gynecology. It is also the most common anesthetic for colonoscopies, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I have never heard of anyone using it for the treatment of a sleep disorder,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere have been cases of health care professionals self-administering the drug and abusing it, however, said Vila, who has examined deaths from Diprivan in Florida.\n\n\n\nOther deaths from the drug have occurred when administered by non-anesthetist professionals, in settings such as ophthalmology, gynecology and plastic surgery, he said.\n\n\n\nDiprivan appears white and milky, and is usually run as an I.V. drip. In addition to surgical applications, it can be used in the intensive care unit for someone who may be intubated on a ventilator.\n\n\n\nThe drug itself does not provide pain relief, experts say.\n\n\n\nThe principle risks of Diprivan come from improper monitoring of the patient's breathing, Vila said. When a person's breathing slows down, not enough carbon dioxide gets removed from the body, and not enough oxygen enters. This could lead to cardiac arrest, he said.\n\n\n\nStill, when used properly, Diprivan is not a dangerous drug, he said. \"It's very safe in a properly trained physician's hands.\"\n\n\n\nThe drug has been used in the past to treat prolonged epileptic seizures. A small MayoClinic study in 2008 found that Diprivan was associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrest and deaths in patients with a condition called refractory status epilepticus.\n\n\n\nSide effects of Diprivan may include dizziness and lightheadedness. Balance, coordination and judgment may be affected for up to 24 hours, so patients should not drive cars, play sports or sign contracts in that period, Vila said.\n\n\n\nPatients may also experience a euphoric feeling upon waking up, Vila said. This is distinct from older anesthetics, which caused nausea and vomiting, he said.\n\n\n\nThe FDA also issued a warning to health care professionals in 2007 about patients who experienced chills, fever and body aches shortly after receiving the drug for sedation or general anesthesia.\n\n\n\nDoctors consider sedation a continuum, where relaxation is on the mild side and general anesthesia is at the other extreme.\n\n\n\nThere may be complications of Diprivan if the patient is also taking prescription pain medications, experts say.\n\n\n\nPatients should tell their health care providers about any allergies they have before taking this drug, doctors say, including eggs, soy products, sulfite, benzyl alcohol and any medications.\n\n\n\nCNN's Stephanie Smith contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(LifeWire) -- Nancy Dunetz, who teaches English as a second language in New York City, sat down in the school staff room to check her e-mail. One of the messages in her inbox was from an acquaintance she'd been corresponding with since their 50th high school reunion last year.\n\n\n\nIn a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person.\n\n\n\nBut this e-mail last June didn't contain chummy banter or reminiscences. It simply included a lewd photo of a partly unclothed young man. The file name of the picture was \"Mid East Hottie.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was shocked!\" says Dunetz, 68. She hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind.\n\n\n\nLater that day, the sender e-mailed an apology to her and two dozen others who had received the e-mail. He explained he'd been experimenting with his new computer and was trying to figure out how to add attachments to an e-mail, Dunetz says. In doing so, he attached an image from his desktop and tried to send it to himself. Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the \"send\" button.\n\n\n\n\"I felt terrible for him,\" Dunetz says. \"I could imagine just how mortified he must have been.\"\n\n\n\nWith some 55 billion e-mails being sent daily (not including spam), according to e-mail archiving company The Radicati Group, misdirected e-mails have become the online equivalent of a wrong number. They're unavoidable, annoying -- and often embarrassing.\n\n\n\nThe 'uh-oh' e-mail\n\n\n\nIn a recent online survey conducted by AOL, 32 percent of the 4,000 respondents have at one time or another mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to an unintended recipient. And often, it's something not so nice.\n\n\n\nKarla Comer, an account executive at an ad agency in Greensboro, North Carolina, knows just how embarrassing that can be. In 2004, Comer met a guy at a concert and went out with him a few times, but ultimately realized she wasn't interested. \"He was just awkward and clumsy. And sometimes I'd catch him staring at me, which really creeped me out,\" she says.\n\n\n\nShe tried to end the relationship by simply not returning his phone calls. \"But then he e-mailed and casually said that he had not heard from me in a while and he hoped everything was fine but just assumed I was busy,\" says Comer, 31.\n\n\n\n\"Before I returned his e-mail, I sent the message to a close girlfriend with a blurb about what an idiot I thought he was and that dating him was a bad idea because he had no understanding of social cues.\"\n\n\n\nShe thought she sent the \"he's an idiot\" e-mail only to her girlfriend.\n\n\n\nTo her horror, Comer says, the spurned beau replied a few minutes later, calling her some not-so-sweet names and suggesting that she \"share THIS e-mail with your friends.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was speechless,\" says Comer, who chose to not respond. \"But eventually I was able to laugh at it.\"\n\n\n\nWhen errant e-mails are sent at work, however, there's often much more at stake than personal embarrassment.\n\n\n\nThree years ago, Jamie Diamond, 33, e-mailed his then-boss to ask about a client at the public relations firm where he was working. His boss wrote back, criticizing the client as incompetent and urging Diamond to \"go around him if you want to get anything done.\"\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client.\n\n\n\n\"One click, and suddenly we'd lost a $5 million account,\" says Diamond, who is now self-employed as a publicist in Williams, Oregon.\n\n\n\nCan you turn back time?\n\n\n\nShort of erasing someone's memory, there is no surefire way to retrieve a missent e-mail. Microsoft Outlook has a \"recall\" function that can erase unread e-mails from the in-box of the recipient -- as long as the recipient is using the same mail client or server as the sender -- as does AOL, but only for messages between AOL users. (Both AOL and CNN are divisions of Time Warner.)\n\n\n\nThen there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail.\n\n\n\nBut old-fashioned vigilance is probably the best way to avert these snafus in the first place. Roger Matus, CEO of e-mail archiving company InBoxer Inc. and keeper of the blog Death By Email, believes the easiest way to avoid these mistakes is to forget that the \"reply all\" button even exists. \"Simply put, there is rarely a real reason to use it,\" he says. \"Often, when you hit it, you end up e-mailing people who were blind carbon copied without realizing.\"\n\n\n\nMatus offers the following tips on avoiding e-mail embarrassment:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Type out the person's full name when addressing your e-mail. If you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book, it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Double-check the addresses of your intended recipients before you hit \"send.\" Do you really want all the people to get this particular message?\n\n\n\n\u2022 Be sure to notify your company's legal department if there is any chance that governance, compliance or privacy regulations were violated as a result of something you sent by mistake.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and, if possible, ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away.\n\n\n\nLifeWire provides original and syndicated content to Web publishers.

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- It was the hottest ticket in town. Colin Farrell was there. So were Michelle Branch, Josh Groban and Chris Isaak -- the latter accompanied by his manager's dog, Rodney.\n\n\n\nYusuf, formerly known as Cat Stevens, believes he can help bridge gaps between cultures.\n\n\n\nNo, we're not talking about a Britney Spears or U2 concert. We're talking about a star-studded, invitation-only club show by Yusuf -- the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens.\n\n\n\nIt was the legendary folk singer's first L.A. show in 33 years, and the audience gave him a heartfelt \"welcome back.\"\n\n\n\nHe played for just over an hour: half a dozen songs from his new album, \"Roadsinger,\" plus a few gems from the '60s and '70s. It was \"Peace Train\" that elicited a singalong, with the entire room participating in the song's signature hand claps.\n\n\n\nBranch, who sings backup on Yusuf's new album, admitted to getting teary-eyed. \"You don't understand,\" she said. \"I learned how to play guitar with the Cat Stevens songbook!\"  Watch Yusuf talk about his songbook -- and his life \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe whole evening seemed awash in good vibes. Concertgoers didn't even mind having a security guard electronically wand them on the way in. It was perhaps an extra security measure given some of the lingering controversy surrounding the headliner's conversion to Islam at the height of his popularity in 1977, during which time he changed his name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam.\n\n\n\nIn 2004, he was famously denied entry into the United States after his name appeared on a no-fly list. He maintained that it was a case of mistaken identity with another man named Yousuf Islam.\n\n\n\nHowever, there was no mistaking the artist on stage at the El Rey Theater last week. At 60, he may look more like a hip college professor than the dark-haired, sensitive sex symbol he was in the '70s, but the message and the music remained the same.\n\n\n\nThe following is an edited version of his interview with CNN.\n\n\n\nCNN: For a lot of people, it's not only the music but what the music represents. Hearing the old Cat Stevens songs makes people feel warm and fuzzy, a throwback to a simpler time.\n\n\n\nYusuf: That's true, and that's why we gave a sprinkling of those songs. When I want to see Paul McCartney, I'd expect to hear \"Eleanor Rigby\" -- something from the past -- because there's something about that that we connect with, and a person becomes part of our life. And I am a part of a lot of people's lives, and my words have resounded in a lot of people's philosophies and the way they look at things, and that's great. Somehow, that's one of the reasons I took life and songwriting very seriously.\n\n\n\nCNN: But you gave it up for a while.\n\n\n\nYusuf: At a certain point I said, \"I've got more living to do,\" and I stopped making music, and I started living.\n\n\n\nCNN: Many people don't think they start living until they HAVE the fame and fortune. But you didn't start living until you gave it up.\n\n\n\nYusuf: It's true. I was very normal -- in some sense, a very shy person. I had to become a persona. I had to kind of put it on a little bit, and therefore I retreated a little bit at a certain point in my career because I thought, \"I can't do this.\"\n\n\n\nSo I just became withdrawn, and then people say, \"Well, the guy's a bit of a recluse, you know.\" The fact was, I was just a little bit scared of being out there!\n\n\n\nAnd I wanted to be sincere, as well. It wasn't easy to be sincere in the music business.\n\n\n\nCNN: I think a lot of people were surprised when you converted to Islam in the '70s. People didn't understand it. Even today, I think there are those who still don't understand it.\n\n\n\nYusuf: It's true. I used to be prejudiced -- as prejudiced as anyone about Islam. ... And then I was given the opportunity of reading the actual source, the Quran itself, without anybody forcing me or looking over my shoulder and saying, \"What do you think?\" It was just me in my space.\n\n\n\nAnd the more I read the Quran, the more I realized that it was like an incredible matrix of connection with Christianity and Judaism. I mean Jesus, Moses, the religion of Abraham in this book! And I said, \"Wow, how come I didn't know this before?\" It was kind of like a secret.\n\n\n\nSo that was kind of my discovery, and a lot of people, I don't think, have gone through that process because they've seen Islam as a headline -- and you never learn anything about a headline. Because headlines, you know -- people make things up, to be honest.\n\n\n\nCNN: In 2004, you were put on a no-fly list and denied entry into the United States. How did you view that?\n\n\n\nYusuf: I felt chosen! I felt suddenly, I was given a halo. \"This guy stands for peace, and they won't let him in.\" And so I turned it from a no-fly list to a no-song list, and I wrote a song about it (\"Boots and Sand\"), and I decided to take it lightly. It was really kind of a joke, in a way, because the person I am and the kind of things they were kind of insinuating by putting me on this list with other people who were very dangerous --\n\n\n\nCNN: You mean you're not dangerous?\n\n\n\nYusuf: No! Touch me! (laughs) It was upsetting for a lot more people than myself. And you know, I'm here now (in the United States), so things are kind of working themselves out. But there's a new administration, a new president, and it's a great new day.\n\n\n\nCNN: Obama seems to be reaching out to people of all faiths around the world.\n\n\n\nYusuf: I think a person like Obama has some kind of faith in his special role that he has to perform. And that role -- if not prophetic -- it's a divine role. It's helping humanity and people get together and live together and prosper. That's a big demand on one person, so it cannot happen with him alone. There's going to have to be a lot of changes around the world. But it is happening.\n\n\n\nCNN: There are people who have said you've been associated with groups funneling money to Hamas.\n\n\n\nYusuf: Yup. Yeah. So the biggest thing in my life is ... why do I have to defend being charitable? Oh, because somehow, somewhere, somebody got a bit of that money, and he's on a list, and somebody else is on a list -- God almighty! That has nothing to do with me. I'm just trying to be charitable!\n\n\n\nI think if everybody followed every penny that they ever gave, they would find some very interesting stories behind what has happened to their money. Possibly a lot of it would have gone to waste in administration, as well as other places. It's unfortunate that people have to associate someone because he's got a different faith -- or because he's a Muslim -- with something bad.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you believe that will get better?\n\n\n\nYusuf: Oh, yeah. I'm very much an optimist. And I believe in the hereafter, as well. And that's a big thing!\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you believe that you have a role and that your role is to reach out and touch people through song?\n\n\n\nYusuf: Very much. I think I've been given a position and place in this world which is quite unique. The fact that I'm a Westerner by birth and I'm a Muslim at the same time -- and living in this time where there seems to be such a gravitational split in polarities -- there need to be bridges, and I think music is one of the best ways to bridge all those gaps.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday night he will work with Congress and the military to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that bars gays and lesbians from openly serving in the armed forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama made the remark in his first State of the Union speech during a short litany of civil rights issues, which included his successful hate crimes bill, a move to \"crack down on equal-pay laws\" and improvement of the immigration system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we are all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeigh in on the president's address\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Navy pilot Sen. John McCain said \"it would be a mistake\" to repeal the 1993 law that bars gay men and lesbians from revealing their sexual orientation, and prevents the military from asking about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years, and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels,\" McCain said. \"We have the best-trained, best-equipped, and most professional force in the history of our country, and the men and women in uniform are performing heroically in two wars. At a time when our Armed Forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield, now is not the time to abandon the policy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in a message to Pentagon leadership, Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it's time to repeal the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a nation built on the principal of equality, we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military,\" said Shalikashvili. His letter was sent to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who supports repealing the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization that works with those affected by the \"don't ask, don't tell\" law, praised Obama's call for repeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010,\" the group said. \"We call on the president to repeal the archaic 1993 law in his defense budget currently being drafted, that is probably the only and best moving bill where DADT can be killed this year. ... The American public, including conservatives, is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, flatly disagreed with the idea of ending it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to 'don't ask don't tell,' frankly, I think it's worked very well. And we just ought to leave it alone,\" he said to reporters Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy prohibits openly gay men and women from serving in the U.S. armed forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy bans military recruiters or authorities from asking about an individual's sexual orientation but also prohibits a service member from revealing that he or she is gay.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, supports ending the practice but wants to go about it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin said he did not have any details about what the president would say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we do this in a way which isn't sensitive ... we could have exactly the opposite effect of what I hope will be the case -- which is to change the policy,\" he said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin said the committee plans to hold hearings on the issue in early February, although the hearing may be with outside experts -- delaying a hearing with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, that had originally been promised, CNN was told by a congressional source.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama campaigned on the promise that he would repeal the law in his first year of office.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign, in October, Obama admitted that \"our progress may be taking longer than we like,\" but he insisted his administration was still on track to overturn the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPentagon Spokesman Geoff Morrell deflected repeated questions about the policy at Wednesday's Pentagon briefing, directing reporters to take their questions to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We continue to work on this problem,\" said Morrell. \"But I'm not going to get into it with more specificity than that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ed Hornick and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.",

Not really, according to a report from the folks at PCWorld, who say that only a fraction of the country's airports are ready for takeoff when it comes to meeting passengers' electronic needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Overall, I would give the top 40 airports a C grade for accommodating tech-savvy travelers,\" senior editor Mark Sullivan said. \"The airports, together, offer an average of 5.5 outlets per gate. When you consider that most people are now carrying devices that need wireless service and battery charge-up, this number is woefully low.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) tops the magazine's \"20 Best U.S. Airports for Tech Travelers\" list released this week. The airport got decent marks across all categories, and its Wi-Fi and cellular signals helped it edge out the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing close behind is New York's JFK International (JFK), whose $800 million Terminal 5 wowed researchers. Delta Air Lines' terminals 2 and 3 at JFK also impressed them, with restaurants that had iPad kiosks to take your order in the gate area and have your food delivered there. Overall, the airport offered more electrical outlets than any other and \"decent\" free Wi-Fi.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country's busiest airport, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL), came in third place. The electrical outlets available to passengers totaled 1,377, an average 8.1 per gate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. 20 on the \"best\" list? Oregon's Portland International, which managed to rate in all categories despite what PCWorld called its \"painfully slow (but free) airport Wi-Fi.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPCWorld researchers visited 3,300 gates, testing more than 17,000 electrical outlets, 5,000 USB ports and 1,350 charging stations during an audit of the 40 busiest airports in the United States. Auditors also conducted hundreds of tests of airport Wi-Fi and cellular broadband service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the airports that didn't make the top 20 list, Denver International came in last, at No. 40.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exhaustive study took nearly four months and examined the features, or lack thereof, that were common frustrations for tech-savvy travelers. These included the average number of electrical outlets, USB ports, charging stations, Internet kiosks and workspace available per airline gate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe this feature to be the largest and most complex undertaking in the magazine's 28-year history,\" senior editor Mark Sullivan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom line? Even among the winners, PCWorld\u00c2\u00b9s researchers concluded that there's plenty of room for improvement.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a second vaccine intended to protect against cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nGlaxoSmithKline has manufactured a vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nCervarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, was approved Friday for prevention of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18.\n\n\n\nThe vaccine is approved for use in girls and women ages 10 to 25 years and is to be administered in three doses. After the initial shot, the second and third doses are to be given within six months.\n\n\n\n\"The licensure of Cervarix adds another option in the prevention of cervical cancer,\" said Dr. Karen Midthun, acting director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \"It has the potential to save lives from cervical cancer as well as reduce the need for biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the necessary follow-up from abnormal Pap tests.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to GlaxoSmithKline, the vaccine is 70 percent effective against pre-cancerous lesions, regardless of HPV type.\n\n\n\n\"The vaccine contains two HPV types (16 & 18) responsible for the majority of cervical cancers in North America,\" said Sarah Alspach, a GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman. \"But approximately 25 percent of cervical cancers are caused by other cancer-causing HPV types. Cervarix has been shown to reduce the incidence of pre-cancers resulting from cancer-causing virus types beyond 16 and 18.\"\n\n\n\nThe vaccine will be available this year, according to GSK, which did not divulge the price.\n\n\n\nCervarix will be competing with Merck & Company's Gardasil, the first cervical cancer vaccine, which won FDA approval in June 2006. Gardasil, for girls and women ages 9 to 26, prevents against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers and protects against HPV types 11, 16 and 18.\n\n\n\nGardasil's approval has been broadened by the FDA to include an indication for boys and young men ages 9 through 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11.\n\n\n\n\"This vaccine is the first preventive therapy against genital warts in boys and men ages 9 through 26, and, as a result, fewer men will need to undergo treatment for genital warts.\" Midthun said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the nation.\n\n\n\nMore than 40 types of HPV can infect genital areas, according to the disease agency. But because many of them are not visible to the naked eye, most people who become infected don't know it.",

  "context": "New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- The lone survivor of a deadly home invasion wrapped up his testimony Tuesday afternoon after taking the stand against the second man charged with brutally killing his wife and two daughters.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith relatives packed shoulder to shoulder in the two rows closest to the jury, Dr. William Petit testified in detail about the tragic events at his Cheshire, Connecticut, home on July 23, 2007, beginning with him being awakened by being hit by a bat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his hands and feet were tied and a cloth was thrown over his head, he said, he heard a voice say, \"If he moves, shoot him.\" Some of the evidence presented in court Tuesday included a handgun and photos of the rope used to bind Petit. The jury also saw pictures of his bloody head injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nPetit told the court that while he was tied to a pole in the basement, he could hear \"loud thuds\" and \"moaning,\" likely from his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Shortly before hearing his wife, Petit was told by one of the intruders, \"Don't worry. It'll all be over in a few minutes.\" Petit said that's when he knew \"I had to get out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPetit managed to escape but could not summon help in time to save his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe described his eldest daughter, Hayley, as captain of her varsity basketball team, a crew participant and soccer player, and Dartmouth-bound. His younger daughter, Michaela, was a piano player, a flute player, into sports and a member of a Brownies troop, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua Komisarjevsky, 31, faces 17 charges in connection with the brutal home invasion. The first defendant to stand trial in the case, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in December after being convicted on 16 of the 17 charges filed against him.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony in the trial began Monday, with witnesses describing the final moments of Petit's wife and daughters inside their burning home and the futile attempts to save them.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors declined to give an opening statement to start the trial. But they did introduce tapes from two 911 calls, a bank teller who claimed the mother tried to withdraw $15,000 as ransom and a police officer who found Petit fighting for life outside his family's burning home.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors allege that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. William Petit managed to escape.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering the New Haven court on Monday, the first day of the trial, Petit succinctly told reporters, \"I just hope justice is served.\" Several other members of the victims' family packed the courtroom, many of them wearing pins that Judge Jon C. Blue allowed over defense lawyers' objections that they might sway the jury.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile he didn't present a comprehensive statement, New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington briefly spoke to jurors Monday, explaining that prosecutors believe the jury will be able to listen to the evidence and render a decision. As allowed by law, Dearington said, Komisarjevsky is charged both as a principal and an accessory.\n\n\n\n\n\nKomisarjevsky's defense attorney, Walter Bansley, told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone, that his sole purpose in breaking into the Petit home was to steal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBansley said Komisarjevsky did not have a weapon. He told jurors that in order to convict Komisarjevsky of capital murder, they must determine he intended to kill someone.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Hayes, Bansley said, who raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, poured gasoline in the house and lit a match. Komisarjevsky was a willing participant in the break-in and theft but not the murders, according to Bansley, who recounted mounting dissension between Hayes and Komisarjevsky as the home invasion progressed that morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHayes felt that the Petits needed to be killed, Bansley claimed, but Komisarjevsky refused to kill anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nBansley did allude to a \"confession\" that Komisarjevsky had later made in the incident. It was not entered into testimony Monday. During Hayes' trial, a court clerk read from a 40-page letter Komisarjevsky wrote to author Brian McDonald in 2008 in which he described the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All were compliant,\" he wrote. \"This time I took a risk, pulled the trigger, and the chamber was loaded. ... The Petit family passed through their fears and into terror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"... It was captivating, validating that this pain in me was real. ... I was looking right at my personal demon, reflected back in their eyes. ... Hayley is a fighter; she tried time and time again to free herself. ... Mr. Petit is a coward; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened, and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen. ... I was cheated of my retribution, and so was Steve. ... I am what I am; I make no excuses. ... I'm a criminal with a criminal mind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reading continued, \"Michaela, Hayley, and Jennifer, forgive me; I am damned. ... I can't believe I lost control; I hate myself/I love myself. ... I stand condemned.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the defense lawyers presented their opening statements Monday, the prosecution began to present evidence and call witnesses, starting with the same five people, in the same order, as in Hayes' trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first person on the stand Monday was Mona Huggard, a registered nurse at Petit's medical practice who said Hawke-Petit had called in to say her husband was sick -- only the second time, in her recollection, that he'd ever done so.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Kristin Makhzangi testified how Hawke-Petit came to her bank window to withdraw $15,000. Video showed the transaction, which spurred a 911 call from the Bank of America branch's manager, Mary Lyons, warning that that the family might be in trouble. Lyons described Hawke-Petit as \"terrified.\" About an hour after the visit, authorities say, she was dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother 911 call came from the Petits' next-door neighbor David Simcik, who testified spotting William Petit \"all banged up\" and asking him to call police.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day ended with Cheshire Police Office Thomas Wright taking the stand to explain how he'd arrived to find Petit bloodied on his neighbor's driveway.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time he tried, unsuccessfully, to enter the door of the home, Hayes and Komisarjevsky had left and \"everything was burning,\" Wright said. Authorities threw rocks at windows and doused flames with a nearby hose.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut once they finally got in, \"We saw no signs of life,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Session's Sunny Hostin and CNN's Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- A man walks through Washington's Union Station with a backpack and puts it down by a potted plant. No one notices him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe looks like any traveler. But inside his backpack are explosives.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, a yellow Labrador retriever named Zeta enters the same crowded room, straining at her handler's leash.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has picked up the scent of black powder in the air and tracks it to the foot of the ficus tree, where she sits and waits eagerly for a reward.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a thwarted terrorist strike but a demonstration of what a \"vapor wake\" dog can do.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, specially trained dogs have run their noses over objects to screen for explosives. But vapor wake dogs can detect explosives in the air despite crowds, cross-currents and other odors.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir trainers say some of the dogs have been able to enter a room and pick up the scent as much as 15 minutes after explosives have passed through. Proponents say the dogs can detect a few grams of explosives.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost are trained to recognize a dozen, but some dogs have learned as many as 20 types, including TATP, the explosive used in the London transit bombings, and ammonium nitrate, which Timothy McVeigh used to bring down the Alfred R. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a dog needs to learn an explosive, it can do so in one or two days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Technology sometimes goes bad after two, three years, and you have to get new stuff,\" said Capt. William Parker of the Amtrak Police Canine Program. \"A dog gets better as the years go on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nParker says he is amazed by the dogs' capabilities and compares them to top athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Michael Jordan was one of the best basketball players of all time, and these vapor wake dogs I put in the same category.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt an Auburn University kennel in Anniston, Alabama, yellow Labrador retriever puppies romp and roll in a grassy pen. They have been bred for vapor wake traits, but only 1 or 2 percent of them will make the cut.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeanne Brock, who manages the puppy program, says successful vapor wake dogs must have a strong instinct to hunt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They'll hunt and hunt and hunt and won't come back without it,\" Brock said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Pearce, who developed the program, says his best dogs are friendly but not overly social.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could care less about being petted,\" Pearce explained. \"We are looking for a dog that is just very strong and very independent in searching, pick up air scent very easily without the direction of a handler.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a few weeks old, the dogs are introduced to a variety of walking surfaces, like the slippery tiles they will find in a transit station. They are exposed to noises and large groups of people to make them more adaptable.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder puppies are then placed in prisons in Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama, where inmates begin teaching them to use their noses.\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, they come back to Auburn and undergo a training regimen that  is largely secret and is in the process of being patented. The dogs get 25 weeks of training, 14 of them with their permanent handlers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The dogs, when you get them, have more training than you do, and you have to play catch up,\" said Amtrak police officer Ed Ross, who works with Zeta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police have just started using the $20,000 vapor wake dogs. The Federal Protective Service has a few. But Amtrak Police have made them a key part of their explosive detection strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nParker says they provide a non-intrusive way of screening large numbers of passengers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can take the dog to the situation; you don't need to take the situation to the dog,\" he said. \"They can go anywhere and adjust to the situation. They can be out in the cold. They can be out in the wind or the rain or the storm. What equipment can do that?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Amtrak's dogs have hit on fertilizer, nitroglycerin pills and photo paper, which all contain the same chemicals as explosives, Parker said all the situations were quickly resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Gillette, a veterinarian who is director of Auburn's Animal Health and Performance Program, says dogs' noses are remarkably sensitive instruments that sample the air several times a second.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe compares a vapor wake dog to a chef who can discern the scent of a particular herb in a complex stew.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the dogs, Gillette says, finding explosives is simply a game:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At some point, this one scent comes up, and he's like 'Oh, that's the one I like! That's the one I get rewarded for! I love this, so let's go find this!' \"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- It seems the world of the golf cart is changing if certain industry manufacturers are to be believed. By shedding their normal surroundings, improving their dowdy image and hitting the streets -- \"pimped up\" carts may increasingly be seen away from the course.\n\n\n\nCelebrities have been queuing up to jump on the buggy-wagon. The most recent purchase was by pop star Cheryl Cole, who bought husband and Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole a \"Mini-Hummer\" buggy as a gift, spending $8,000 customizing the cart with gold-plated hub caps, Swarovski crystals and a trunk for his golf clubs.\n\n\n\nDominik Jackson, owner of Mini-Hummer says demand for the vehicles has rocketed since 2006: \"It started as a glorified golf buggy, but since adapting the look we've had demand from all over Europe and even from royal families in the Middle East.\" The carts are already on the roads in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and the company are planning to launch a new fully enclosed Mini-Hummer in London next year.\n\n\n\nWhile Europe is catching up with the trend, there has been a big market for \"pimped\" golf carts in the United States for some time. \"I'd say about 99% of our sales these days are for individual use,\" says Randy Hopper, owner of Sick 'N' Twisted Designs, one of the largest bespoke golf cart manufacturers in California. \"We build customized golf carts to the specific requirements of the customer - we pretty much do everything.\"\n\n\n\nAnd this really means everything. Modern carts are now built with leather seats, wooden dashboard, surround-sound systems, iPod players, lower lighting and air bags, in a variety of themes - street, lifted, off-road and even Limo carts.\n\n\n\nSick 'N' Twisted customer Dave Johnson is having his golf cart pimped and modified to match the color of his boat: \"It's going to be burgundy with 12-inch wheels, full sound system and air-bags that adjust the height of the cart.\" Dave insists that in his neighborhood, golf carts are more of an everyday than a luxury item: \"They're practical, affordable and it's  nice to cruise around and see your neighbors.\"\n\n\n\nSo is this a case of keeping up with the Joneses? \"There's no official competition on our street, but people take notice of things like that. It's definitely seen as a status symbol.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the golf cart remains a staple on the fairways, the souped-up street version is no longer just par for the course.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Earth Day may fall later this week, but as far as former NASA astronaut Edgar Mitchell and other UFO enthusiasts are concerned, the real story is happening elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAstronaut Edgar Mitchell, shown after his Apollo mission in 1971, claims there \"is no doubt we are being visited.\"\n\n\n\nMitchell, who was part of the 1971 Apollo 14 moon mission, asserted Monday that extraterrestrial life exists, and that the truth is being concealed by the U.S. and other governments.\n\n\n\nHe delivered his remarks during an appearance at the National Press Club following the conclusion of the fifth annual X-Conference, a meeting of UFO activists and researchers studying the possibility of alien life forms.\n\n\n\nMankind has long wondered if we're \"alone in the universe. [But] only in our period do we really have evidence. No, we're not alone,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\n\n\"Our destiny, in my opinion, and we might as well get started with it, is [to] become a part of the planetary community. ... We should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there.\"\n\n\n\nMitchell grew up in Roswell, New Mexico, which some UFO believers maintain was the site of a UFO crash in 1947. He said residents of his hometown \"had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities.\" They had been warned of \"dire consequences\" if they did so.\n\n\n\nBut, he claimed, they \"didn't want to go to the grave with their story. They wanted to tell somebody reliable. And being a local boy and having been to the moon, they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story.\"\n\n\n\nRoughly 10 years ago, Mitchell claimed, he was finally given an appointment at Pentagon to discuss what he had been told.\n\n\n\nAn unnamed admiral working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff promised to uncover the truth behind the Roswell story, Mitchell said. The stories of a UFO crash \"were confirmed,\" but the admiral was then denied access when he \"tried to get into the inner workings of that process.\"\n\n\n\nThe same admiral, Mitchell claimed, now denies the story.\n\n\n\n\"I urge those who are doubtful: Read the books, read the lore, start to understand what has really been going on. Because there really is no doubt we are being visited,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"The universe that we live in is much more wondrous, exciting, complex and far-reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time.\"\n\n\n\nA NASA spokesman denied any cover-up.\n\n\n\n\"NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else -- period,\" Michael Cabbage said Monday.\n\n\n\nDebates have continued about what happened at Roswell. The U.S. Air Force said in 1994 that wreckage recovered there in 1947 was most likely from a balloon-launched classified government project.\n\n\n\nStephen Bassett, head of the Paradigm Research Group (PRG), which hosted the X-Conference, said that the truth about extraterrestrial life is being suppressed because it is politically explosive.\n\n\n\n\"There is a third rail [in American politics], and that is the UFO question. It is many magnitudes more radioactive than Social Security ever dreamed to be,\" Bassett said.",

  "context": "Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- When Amanda Knox's parents head to Italy for closing arguments in their daughter's murder trial they'll be carrying a present they hope desperately she can use soon: a plane ticket home.\n\n\n\nIn that purchase lies one family's entire hope.\n\n\n\nCurt Knox and Edda Mellas say their daughter is nothing like the person they've seen depicted before and during her trial.\n\n\n\nThey grimace at the description prosecutors have used in court: that Amanda Knox was a resentful American so angry with her British roommate Meredith Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sex misadventure at their home two years ago.\n\n\n\nProsecutors say Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat.\n\n\n\n\"She is totally nonviolent, almost a passive person,\" Mellas told CNN in a joint interview with her former husband.\n\n\n\nSo passive was Knox, the parents said, that she couldn't even continue a kickboxing class because she felt it was too violent. She was so caring, they said, that she would make her friends stop a car to let a spider out rather than kill it.\n\n\n\nKnox was an easy child to raise in Seattle, Washington, along with her younger sisters Deanna and Ashley, her parents said. She took to soccer early on but hit the books as hard as she played.\n\n\n\nIt was on the field that she earned the nickname Foxy Knoxy, though they say it was rarely used and taken out of context when Kercher was found killed to portray their daughter as a sex-hungry party animal.\n\n\n\n\"It was totally associated to soccer and how she prepared herself as a defender, waiting to take on a striker going down,\" Curt Knox said. \"So how people read this nickname is totally wrong.\"\n\n\n\nEventually, though a star player at college, Knox gave up the sport to focus on her education. She knew she wanted to study in Italy and wouldn't be able to leave the team to go abroad. Her mother said she threw herself into jobs to help the family save for the trip, working as a soccer coach, a barista and in a gallery.\n\n\n\nThey recall a young woman far different from the wild party girl depicted by prosecutors, one they said found more enjoyment in going to a coffee house and reading a book than going out to a club.\n\n\n\nThey say she met her former boyfriend and co-accused Sollecito at a classical concert.\n\n\n\nYes, they concede, Knox, now 22, and Sollecito say they were smoking marijuana and having sex at his home the night Kercher was killed, but that was as wild as it got.\n\n\n\nThey reject the idea of revenge as a motive for Knox to kill Kercher. Mellas said her daughter e-mailed and called to tell her about her new roommate regularly. Knox told her they got along great and spent time together, going to libraries and a chocolate festival.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened in Perugia, Italy, is unfathomable to them.\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2007, at 4 a.m. in Seattle, Mellas was awakened by the phone.\n\n\n\n\"Amanda called [and said] 'I hate to wake you up, but something's not right here, I think someone's been in my house,' \" Mellas recalled.\n\n\n\nThe door to the home she shared with Kercher had been ajar when she came home that morning, and when Knox got out of a quick shower, she noticed drops of blood. Kercher's door was locked, and Knox couldn't reach her, she told her mother, adding that Sollecito was calling the police.\n\n\n\nLater, when officers broke down the door to Kercher's room, Mellas said her daughter struggled to understand what was going on, hanging on the few words of Italian she understood at the time.\n\n\n\n\"They were screaming 'A foot, a foot,' that's what they could see,\" Mellas recalled Amanda Knox saying.\n\n\n\nWhen she learned Kercher was dead in the room, a hysterical Knox called her mother, Mellas remembered.\n\n\n\n\"We were constantly on the phone,\" she said. \"She was tired, scared, there was a murderer out running around and she was afraid to be alone.\"\n\n\n\nOn the day Knox was arrested, Mellas was flying to Italy to be with her daughter, to comfort her and help her find a new place to live since her home was still a crime scene.\n\n\n\nBut Mellas' plane was diverted to Switzerland, where she switched on her phone and learned that Knox had been charged with murder.\n\n\n\n\"I felt physically ill, I went to the bathroom to throw up. I was stuck [in Switzerland] for five hours,\" Mellas recalled, beginning to cry.\n\n\n\nBy the time she reached Italy and was allowed to see her daughter, Mellas had already heard news reports that Knox had confessed. She was flabbergasted and confused.\n\n\n\nSee the evidence against Amanda Knox\n\n\n\n\"It was horrible. We cried most of the time,\" Mellas recalled of the first meeting. \"But we held each other and it all made sense. She told me what happened in the interrogation, how they asked her to imagine the possibilities. She talked about being hit, screamed at, threatened; it was the most horrible thing she had ever been through in her entire life.\"\n\n\n\nBut even with the way Knox has been treated and portrayed, her parents know they are the lucky parents in this case.\n\n\n\n\"As parents, the Kercher family received the worst phone call they could get,\" Curt Knox said, adding he believes Kercher has gotten lost in the sensational coverage. \"At least our daughter called us.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the arrest, Mellas was sure there was a mix-up or problems with translation that would soon be cleared up.\n\n\n\nBut they weren't.\n\n\n\nWhen Guede was later arrested in Germany, police said he had been speaking to a friend on a Skype call monitored by police and had been talking about being at Kercher's house. Mellas and Curt Knox were sure again that everything would be fixed. During the conversation, despite saying that he knew who Amanda Knox was, he never indicated she was at the home the night of the murder.\n\n\n\nBut after being jailed, his story changed, and he pointed the finger at Knox and her then-boyfriend, Sollecito.\n\n\n\nHer family said they've tried to shield Knox from knowing how high-profile the case has gotten and how people are talking about her, discussing what she wears to court and what kind of person she is.\n\n\n\nBut she does know she may be going to jail for a very long time. During closing arguments, prosecutors asked for her to be sentenced to life in prison, shocking her family who had expected a demand for 30 years.\n\n\n\nRead about the case against Amanda Knox\n\n\n\nStill, at occasional prison visits, Curt Knox and Mellas try to give Knox a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\n\n\"We have to try and put on a face that it is going to work out,\" Mellas said, beginning to cry. \"We keep telling her it's taking way longer than expected but she will get out of there. They will not put an innocent 20-year-old in jail, they just can't.\"\n\n\n\nThey take solace and hold onto the moments the court allows Knox to share with her parents after the trial has recessed each day.\n\n\n\n\"They allowed us to go into the back room and say goodbye and hug her, tell her we love her,\" Curt Knox said choking up. \"Just those few seconds are worth a lot.\"",

Investigators arrested his 22-year-old brother, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalman played center field for the Seattle Mariners. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement expressing his condolences to the team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The loss of a talented 24-year-old young man like Greg, amid such tragic circumstances, is painful for all of us throughout the game,\" Selig said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetra Dorrestijn, a spokeswoman for the Royal Baseball and Softball Union of the Netherlands, said Halman's family confirmed his death to the federation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are shocked to hear that Gregory Halman has passed away,\" she said. \"It is tragic that he should die at such a young age.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHalman was a federation member when he played baseball as a teenager for an amateur team in his hometown of Haarlem, just outside Amsterdam, before going to the United States to play, Dorrestijn said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalman made his Major League debut on September 23, 2010, and went on to play 44 games with the Seattle Mariners, Major League Baseball said. He finished the 2011 season with 20 hits, including two home runs, in 87 plate appearances, according to figures from Major League Baseball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I only knew Greg for a brief time, but I feel lucky that I had the chance to get to know him,\" Mariners Manager Eric Wedge said in a statement. \"He was a fine young man with a bright future.

As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney.\n\n\"That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after,\" Gortney said.\n\nThe United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia.\n\nThere are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries.\n\nPirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 \u00bb\n\nPirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country.\n\nGortney said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of Somalia less than one percent, but it won't be stopped until piracy is \"disincentivized.\"",

  "context": "ASHEVILLE, North Carolina (CNN) -- In 1988, a relatively unknown rock and blues guitarist named Warren Haynes got some of his friends together to play music in Asheville, North Carolina. It was just an opportunity for local musicians to jam during the holidays, the one time of year they were all in town together.\n\n\n\nWarren Haynes' good work has been noted by the street named after him.\n\n\n\nThe artists also wanted to give back to the community, so they gave the money raised by their show to various charities.\n\n\n\nThe tradition has continued. Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, Haynes' Christmas Jam has evolved into an epic annual event for the musicians, fans, and particularly Habitat for Humanity.\n\n\n\n\"We need Habitat For Humanity more now than ever, with the whole mortgage crisis that put us where we are now, and the fact that Habitat is about building homes for people that can't afford homes as opposed to lending money to people who can't afford homes,\" Haynes told CNN.\n\n\n\nHaynes and his wife, Stefani Scamardo, decided to donate 100 percent of the Christmas Jam proceeds to Habitat for Humanity years ago because they could see exactly where the money was going. They go back each year and meet the families they helped build homes for.\n\n\n\nSinger Joan Osborne echoed Haynes' thoughts. \"It's a scary time. A lot of people are losing their homes so it's good to be able to do something that helps with that specific problem,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGoing into 2008's shows, which were held December 12 and 13, the Christmas Jam had raised more than $665,000 for Asheville's Habitat For Humanity. The money has gone into building 12 houses in Enka Hills, a wooded community surrounded by mountains on a street the organization appropriately named Warren Haynes Drive. (In 2005 Habitat also built a house in the New Orleans Musicians Village.)\n\n\n\nThe Thursday before the show, Haynes presented the key to a new home to single mother Suzie Cromer and her 8-year-old daughter.\n\n\n\n\"Meeting the families and seeing the work that Habitat's doing with our help -- you know its hard to see that and not get emotional,\" Haynes said.\n\n\n\n\"Warren is a hero in our mind,\" said Habitat's Arianne Kjellquist. \"In western North Carolina, the housing costs are really out of whack with what the local wages are, so there's a big discrepancy there. There are more people that maybe would have been approved previously when the lending standards weren't so strict.\"\n\n\n\nThis year's Christmas Jam lived up to the long-lasting and crowd-pleasing traditions of previous shows. The first night's show ran more than nine hours, ending with an Allman Brothers set after 4 a.m. The second night's show ended at 3:30 a.m. Performers included Ben Harper and Relentless 7, Travis Tritt, Michael Franti, Osborne, Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk, Steve Earle and Haynes' band Gov't Mule.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most anticipated addition this year among both fans and artists was former Led Zeppelin member John Paul Jones, who played acoustic mandolin, bass and keyboards throughout the weekend with just about everyone. Jones said he was happy to pitch in.\n\n\n\n\"In the economic climate like this, people really just want to get out and enjoy themselves and forget about the day to day stuff that they have to deal with. So it works on many levels,\" Jones said. \"The fact that it is for a good cause is just a huge bonus.\"\n\n\n\nHaynes says the 20-year evolution of the Christmas Jam reflects his career. \"We've grown up together. Its a parallel of the progress that I have achieved, and the event reflects not only the philosophy I share with these people but the mission.\"\n\n\n\nAnd as fans danced the night away while the artists played their hearts out, families' dreams of owning their perfect home come true.\n\n\n\n\"I would have never imagined or dreamed that it would turn into what its turned into,\" Haynes reflected with a huge smile.",

  "context": "LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Militants in Nigeria's oil-rich southern delta region said they killed six government soldiers after the military attacked one of its camps on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavily armed Nigerian rebels pose a constant threat to oil pipelines in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, in an e-mail, said three military gunboats attacked one of its camps around the Ke River in the country's Rivers state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group said the gunboats were repelled, with six soldiers dying and three militant fighters wounded in the skirmish.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria is Africa's largest crude oil producer and the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States. MEND has demanded that more of the country's oil wealth be pumped into the region instead of enriching foreign investors, and the militants have been attacking oil pipelines in retaliation against government forces, limiting the amount of crude oil that can leave the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nMEND -- the largest rebel group -- has targeted foreign oil companies since 2006. It has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers, typically releasing them unharmed, sometimes after receiving a ransom payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMEND hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the delta, where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts attacks on oil facilities have taken a toll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anytime a pipeline is affected, anytime any production gets shut down, you see oil prices jump up one or two dollars a barrel just because there is no slack in the system,\" said Jim LeCamp, a senior vice president with RBC Wealth Management, which manages assets for wealthy clients worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nExxon and Shell are two of several companies that have been extracting 2 million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. Recent rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat decrease in production comes at a time of increased demand from oil-hungry regions such as China, Russia and Latin America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anytime there's a disruption there, it really affects the system,\" LeCamp said in a recent interview with CNN.",

You can never say it enough. ... We honor your service, and America is forever grateful.\"\n\n\n\nOn March 26, 1970, the 120-member Troop A volunteered to rescue an American infantry company surrounded by an overwhelming enemy force at a site on the Cambodian border called the Dog's Face. The enemy had survived hours of aerial and artillery bombardment and was expected to kill or capture the 100 American infantrymen in Company C within hours. The Americans were running out of ammunition and could not move because of heavy casualties. There were no available landing zones for medical and rescue helicopters to touch down.\n\n\n\nAlpha Troop heard of their plight on a radio and rode in with an infantry company to rescue their comrades.\n\n\n\n\"Troop A skillfully penetrated four kilometers of nearly impassable jungle terrain and unhesitatingly mounted a fierce assault directly into the heavily fortified North Vietnamese army position,\" the presidential proclamation states.\n\n\n\nWhen the battle was over, more than 70 Americans lay dead or wounded.\n\n\n\nFor retired Capt. John Poindexter, who led the rescue, the award is for all Vietnam veterans, many of whom came home to an unwelcome and sometimes hostile reception.\n\n\n\n\"The veterans of Alpha Troop feel very strongly that we stand in the stead of all veterans of the war of Vietnam,\" Poindexter told CNN before the ceremony. \"The fact is that we're being singled out for a very distinct honor, a very rare one, but it is our conviction that on any day in any other jungle in Vietnam, nearly every Vietnam veteran would have been willing to assume the task that we assumed on March 26, 1970, when we earned the Presidential Unit Citation.\"\n\n\n\nPoindexter had been trying to gain recognition for his men for the past seven years. Initially, he felt deep disappointment.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, he discovered that the men he had recommended for decorations for their valor had not received those citations. Eventually, 14 men received individual decorations.\n\n\n\nThat was not enough.\n\n\n\n\"My role in obtaining the PUC [Presidential Unit Citation] -- or in helping to obtain the PUC -- among the 200 persons who were involved in this matter over a seven-year period, was to be in the unhappy position of discovering that the men who I had recommended for decorations had not been recommended, had not been awarded those decorations,\" the retired captain said.\n\n\n\n\"The result of that was that we got 14 men decorated for their valor, but 14 men out of more than 120 who were engaged in the battle on that fateful day were only a pittance, only a minority, of those who might have been honored. Only a unit citation could honor all equally and impartially, and it was that task we set ourselves on nearly seven years ago. \"\n\n\n\nHe believes lack of popular support for the war had much to do with it taking so long for Alpha Troop to be recognized.\n\n\n\n\"There's little question in our minds that the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam is a major contributing factor to the reception these men received when they returned to the United States and a major factor, in my opinion, in the silence that most of them have assumed since then,\" Poindexter said.\n\n\n\n\"Why talk about something that most people don't have a very high opinion of in all likelihood? And if that isn't true, nevertheless, it's what most of these men think. They were engaged in an unpopular venture that has bedeviled them for much of their adult lives.\"\n\n\n\nNow, the circle has been closed.\n\n\n\n\"It's a very elevating experience to see the men that I have not seen for 40 years since War Zone C in Vietnam,\" the former captain said. \"These are persons who have had success in life, and some have not had a lot of success in life, and to see how they've turned out, how they look these days, and to know I'll be with them in the White House [Tuesday] is a very fulfilling sensation for me.\n\n\n\n\"For me, the sensation of being honored is one of having closed an important chapter on my life in a very fruitful and rewarding way.\"\n\n\n\nThe Presidential Unit Citation is awarded to armed forces units of the United States and allies for extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy on or after December 7, 1941. The unit must display such gallantry, determination and esprit de corps under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign.",

And it has produced a mosaic of plastic and canvas that is now home to more than 93,000 people -- with more arriving each day.\n\n\n\nThese children are among the thousands of refugees this month at the Jalozai camp in western Pakistan.\n\n\n\nThis is Jalozai refugee camp near Peshawar, suddenly almost a city in its own right as thousands flee the violence raging between the Pakistani army and Taliban fighters.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations estimates that it's the biggest movement of people in Pakistan since the country was formed in 1947. Officials say up to 1.8 million people have been forced from their homes.\n\n\n\nFood is available at this camp -- fruit traders work their way through the avenues of tents. But people here can't afford to buy much.\n\n\n\nThey make bread with flour handed out by the United Nations, but they say it's not enough. \"It's very difficult, there's lots of jostling,\" says Mehboob Shah, a man at the camp. When there is food, he says, \"it's very poor quality -- even the cows won't eat it.\"\n\n\n\nSar Bari Khan arrived 15 days ago with his wife and three children. He says his family walked almost 62 miles to escape the fighting. They had to leave his father behind.  Watch a report on the plight of refugees \u00bb\n\n\n\nThere are eight field hospitals in this camp. On a recent morning, 380 new patients registered for treatment -- most of them women and children, suffering from diarrhea and heat stroke. Some have signs of mental trauma.\n\n\n\n\"They are complaining of fear, phobias, palpitations and all symptoms seem to have started since they arrive in this camp,\" said Abid Farooqi, with the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences.\n\n\n\nPakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik underlined the seriousness of the situation. \"I feel that this is even worse than the earthquake in Kashmir,\" he said, referring to the 2005 disaster. He noted that most of the people are from an area with relatively cold weather, and are unprepared for the heat here. Officials, he said, \"are making all possible arrangements\" to help.\n\n\n\nWater tankers provide a lifeline in the stifling heat.\n\n\n\nAnd on the edge of the camp, workers are clearing the ground for more tents. There is no sign of this influx ending any time soon.",

She asks the kids about their anxieties and confronts Jay about the climate of fear in his house.\"\n\n\n\nThe Heenes reportedly allowed their children to accompany them as they tracked Hurricane Gustav.\n\n\n\nA YouTube video of the family appearing on Denver, Colorado's KMGH local newscast features two of the Heene sons briefly discussing chasing the Hurricane.\n\n\n\n\"What my kids learn from these storms and what they walk away with is the fact that these storms can be very deadly,\" Richard Heene told the KMGH reporter.\n\n\n\nAccording to the newscast, the family track 30 to 40 weather activities a year.\n\n\n\nThe family was invited back by ABC to appear on the 100th episode of \"Wife Swap,\" where Mayumi Heene switched places with Sheree Silver, a psychic.\n\n\n\nA Los Angeles Times story documented the show by saying \"The Heene family, with its three rowdy boys, is anchored by father Richard, whose anger arrives in sudden bolts between his fringe science projects.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Silvers, who have two quirky, artistically inclined sons, revolve around the mother, Sheree, who is a psychic and who initially fails to impress Richard. 'Sheree's like a clogged drain, OK? Things aren't happening,' he barks. 'I'll bet you the heaviest thing she lifts is the fork to her mouth.' \"\n\n\n\nMayumi Heene reportedly found it difficult on the show to adjust to Silver's household.\n\n\n\n\"It's their spouses who struggle most,\" the Los Angeles Times story said. \"Richard's wife, Mayumi, finding Sheree's 'househusband,' Sam Castiglia, to be 'a very feminine husband' and finds it tough to even tolerate the quirks of the Silver children, who are so unlike her own, seeming less like a parent than a conspirator against the alien family. So much for learning.\"\n\n\n\nA balloon that was set adrift from the Heenes' Fort Collins, Colorado, home was empty when it landed, and authorities later found one of the Heene sons -- who initially had been thought to be in the balloon -- safe on the ground. Officials said he had been hiding in the attic of the family's garage.\n\n\n\nWhat appears to be the three Heene boys are featured in a YouTube rap music video that seems to spoof overprotective parents.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Drew Peterson has met with a prominent divorce attorney more than a year after his wife, Stacy, disappeared, his lawyer confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nDrew Peterson's behavior after his wife disappeared deepened suspicion, but he says she ran off.\n\n\n\nPeterson, a former Bolingbrook, Illinois, police sergeant, has not filed divorce papers, said his attorney, Joel Brodsky.\n\n\n\nBut Peterson told an author he would look into a divorce after Stacy had been missing for a year. He said he was considering divorce for the sake of their children.\n\n\n\n\"I can confirm that Drew Peterson did have a consultation with Jeffrey Leving,\" Brodsky said, adding that no divorce papers have been filed.\n\n\n\nLeving, who bills himself as a father's rights lawyer, represented Cuban immigrant Elian Gonzalez's uncle and ultimately helped reunite the boy with his father.\n\n\n\nPolice have said that 54-year old Peterson is a suspect in his wife's disappearance, which investigators have labeled a \"potential homicide.\"\n\n\n\nPeterson maintains that his wife, who was 23 at the time of her disappearance, left him for someone else.\n\n\n\nIn an interview in May with Derek Armstrong, author of \"Drew Peterson Exposed,\" Peterson hinted that he planned to divorce her after she had been missing for a year. In Illinois, willful desertion or abandonment is grounds for a divorce after a year.\n\n\n\nThe interview begins with Peterson expressing frustration with the media attention and negative reactions from his neighbors.\n\n\n\n\"We were talking about the neighbors and how it's hard to live in the neighborhood with the media trucks around and the neighbors being so difficult,\" Armstrong told CNN. \"I asked if he was going to move, and he said, 'Yeah, when I get a chance, but Stacy's on the title.' \"\n\n\n\nAfter the one-year anniversary of Stacy Peterson's disappearance passed, Armstrong said he began to make some phone calls to see whether Drew Peterson was acting on his earlier plans.\n\n\n\nArmstrong said he called two other prominent divorce lawyers until he reached Leving's office, which confirmed the meeting.\n\n\n\nIn a phone conversation, Peterson confirmed to Armstrong that he was \"getting information\" and \"exploring options.\"\n\n\n\nArmstrong pressed Peterson, who responded, \"A desertion. She deserted me.\"\n\n\n\nPeterson elaborated, \"I've always said that I'm mad about that. But I'm looking into this for the kids. This neighborhood is not healthy for my kids because of Sharon Bychowski.\"\n\n\n\nBychowski has been battling Peterson since his wife -- her friend and neighbor -- disappeared in October 2007. Peterson has accused Bychowski and other neighbors of harassing and threatening him.\n\n\n\nArmstrong asked Peterson whether he thought news of the divorce might encourage Stacy to contact him. \"I have nothing more to say,\" the former cop shot back.\n\n\n\nBrodsky told CNN he had not been aware that news of the meeting with the divorce lawyer had become public knowledge.\n\n\n\n\"We definitely didn't advertise it,\" he said. \"That's real thorough detective work. [Armstrong] could show police a thing or two about finding someone.\"\n\n\n\nDrew Peterson said he awoke at his suburban Chicago home to find his wife gone October 28, 2007. He said she called him at 9 p.m. and announced that she was leaving him, Peterson said.\n\n\n\nPolice confirm that there was some activity on Stacy Peterson's cell phone about 9 p.m. October 28, but her family and close friends say she would never leave her two children behind or go away without mentioning it to her family.\n\n\n\nIn the days leading up to her disappearance, Stacy Peterson confided in friends and her sister. She said she was afraid of her husband and wanted to leave him, according to her sister, Cassandra Cales.\n\n\n\n\"If anything happens to me, he killed me. It wasn't an accident,\" Cales quoted her as saying.\n\n\n\nAt 10 a.m. that Sunday, Stacy Peterson failed to show up for an appointment with a friend. Worried, Cales called police Monday, October 29, and reported her sister missing.\n\n\n\nThe media frenzy and police scrutiny soon revealed that Drew Peterson's third wife had died mysteriously a few years earlier during a nasty divorce. Kathleen Savio died just before the division of the marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary.\n\n\n\nSavio was found in the dry bathtub of her home. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. But her family continued to insist that Savio died as a result of foul play.\n\n\n\nThe investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death has now been ruled a \"homicide staged to look like an accident.\"\n\n\n\nSome witness statements portray Drew Peterson as jealous, possessive and controlling. He was said to keep such close track of his wife that he frequently called her cell phone and appeared unannounced at social outings to take her home. This caused tension in the marriage, the witnesses told police.\n\n\n\nPolice named Drew Peterson as the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance in November 2007. He has not been charged in the case, but he has been charged with illegal gun possession, which could put him behind bars for up to five years if he is convicted.",

But the controversy around her obscenity-laced tirade at a line judge at the U.S. Open continues.\n\n\n\nWilliams, 27, said she was \"in the moment\" and doesn't really remember her now-famous outburst at a line judge who had called a foot fault. It was a 12-second verbal attack that has played over and over for three days.\n\n\n\n\"It was a really tough point in the match and it was really close and got a really tough call that wasn't the correct call, and, you know, things got a little heated and I had a conversation with the line judge that didn't go so well,\" Williams said.\n\n\n\nWilliams, ranked No. 2 in the world by the Women's Tennis Association, said she does not recall moments of Saturday's incident but believes she apologized for her actions promptly and completely.  Watch Williams talk about call \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"I couldn't apologize any sooner, and then also I learned from my mistakes ... I was talking to [former Giants defensive end] Michael Strahan earlier today and he said how, when he's out there you're so intense. Obviously, when you get a bad call, it's like 'What's going on?' So when you're in the moment, you are just there. You don't really quite remember exactly what's going on,\" Williams said.\n\n\n\nWilliams found herself explaining her outburst while promoting her recently published memoir, \"On the Line,\" in which she details growing up the youngest of five sisters, her struggles on the court and off, and her positive messages of inspiration, especially to her younger fans.\n\n\n\n\"Those kids probably just need to know it's great to be a competitor, how passionate someone is, and just making the right decisions at the right time -- realizing that, hey, everyone falls, 'Wow, she's human, she made a bad decision, a bad choice.' \"\n\n\n\nWilliams added, \"I am not a robot. I have a heart and I bleed.\"\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Saturday's match, tournament officials fined Williams $10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $500 for smashing a racket during the same event. So far, no suspensions have been served, but the United States Tennis Association has said that it has launched an investigation into the incident.",

  "context": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)  -- The five Americans arrested in Pakistan amid suspicion that they were plotting terrorist attacks were transferred on Saturday from the small town where they were seized to a more secure location in a larger city, police said.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. citizens were taken from the town of Sargodha, where they were arrested at a home on Wednesday, to Lahore. A police interrogation report dated Thursday focused on one of the suspects, identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, a 20-year-old born in Virginia.\n\n\n\nThe report said he regularly goes online to watch attacks on the U.S. military in Afghanistan and that he left comments praising the actions. That caught the attention of militants, and he was eventually contacted by a person named Saifullah, the report said.\n\n\n\nAfter contact had been made, a Yahoo! e-mail account was set up so the men and militants could communicate, the report says. E-mails were never sent from the account, but people would leave messages in the draft sections of the e-mail account and delete them after reading them, the Pakistani police report said.\n\n\n\n\"This mode of communication enabled them to pass on messages without fear of interception by the FBI,\" the report said.\n\n\n\nIt said the suspects made a plan with Saifullah to go from Pakistan to Afghanistan. They gathered in Karachi and left for Hyderabad on December 1. They tried to hook up with two militant groups -- Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa -- but neither of them showed interest.\n\n\n\nThe FBI said Pakistani authorities detained the men -- four of whom it said were found to have American passports.\n\n\n\nAlong with Minni, there were snapshots and brief profiles of only four others -- Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan, and Ramy Zamzam -- all from the Washington D.C. area.\n\n\n\nThe five had been formally arrested.\n\n\n\nA sixth man -- Khalid Farouk, father of Umar -- had been taken into custody by police in Sargodha and was being questioned at a safe location. Authorities have said Khalid Farouk has not been considered a suspect.\n\n\n\nCNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The Illinois state Senate on Monday began its impeachment trial against Gov. Rod Blagojevich without the governor present.\n\nIllinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing.\n\nBlagojevich said he expects lawmakers to vote to convict him.\n\nHe is facing federal corruption allegations, including trying to trade or sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president.\n\nThe second-term Democratic governor has denied wrongdoing.\n\nInstead of attending the trial, Blagojevich hit the media circuit Monday. He appeared on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and \"The View,\" and was scheduled to give his first live prime-time interview Monday night on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"\n\nSpeaking on \"Good Morning America,\" Blagojevich restated his complaints about what he called the \"unconstitutional\" impeachment trial, which he said \"denies me the right to call witnesses to defend myself and prove my innocence.\"  Watch Blagojevich say he's done \"nothing wrong\" \u00bb\n\nHe said he is certain the Illinois Senate will vote to remove him from office and said he expects they will demand he step down \"relatively soon.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach him. Blagojevich has said the vote was politically motivated.\n\nUnder the Illinois Constitution, the House can vote to impeach an executive or judicial officer, but it is the Senate that conducts the trial. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict an officer of an impeachable offense.\n\nAccording to a federal complaint issued in December, Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris -- who also was arrested on federal corruption charges -- were \"conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits\" for the governor by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama.\n\n\"I've got this thing and it's [expletive] golden,\" Blagojevich allegedly said in one recorded phone conversation, referring to his authority to appoint, according to the complaint. \"I'm just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing.\"\n\nWhen asked about those alleged quotes, Blagojevich told ABC that federal prosecutors \"took snippets of conversations completely out of context.\"\n\n\"When the whole story comes out, you'll see that the effort was to work to have a senator who can best represent Illinois,\" he said.\n\nBlagojevich has said his rights are being violated because he cannot challenge assertions in the House impeachment report.  Watch Blagojevich demand a fair trial \u00bb\n\nBlagojevich also is asking for a change in a Senate trial rule that he said is preventing him from calling witnesses such as Valerie Jarrett, a confidant of Obama's; Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.; and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\n\nEmanuel, claimed Blagojevich, agrees that he did not break any laws.\n\nState Sen. Matt Murphy, part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together, called Blagojevich's complaints \"the theater of the absurd.\" iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders?\n\n\"What you've seen here ... is a cynical effort on the part of this governor that's perfectly consistent with his actions over the last six years, to try and further undermine the faith in this process that the people already have,\" Murphy said.\n\nHe said the House prosecution team responsible for presenting the impeachment case to the Senate is operating under the same restrictions as Blagojevich with regard to calling witnesses.\n\nMurphy said on \"Good Morning America\" that U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has asked both sides to \"defer to the criminal prosecution\" of Blagojevich and \"limit witnesses.\"\n\nHe noted that the governor has every right to submit \"positive statements that the governor says exonerate him\" -- such as those from Jarrett, Jackson and Emanuel -- as evidence in the Senate trial.\n\n\"We have lowered the standard for the admission of evidence for the governor to bend over backward to make this fair,\" Murphy said. \"The suggestion that this is somehow unfair to the governor is the most self-serving, ludicrous statement I have ever heard in my life. It couldn't be fairer for this guy.\"\n\nBlagojevich missed deadlines this month for answering the impeachment charge and for filing a motion to dismiss, a spokesman for Illinois Senate President John Cullerton has said.",

They claim he gave her Temazepam -- a type of sleeping tablet -- and travel sickness pills and kept her tethered to an elasticated strap attached to a roof beam through a loft hatch when he went out.\n\nMeanwhile Matthews kept up a \"wicked and dishonest lie\" as her daughter became the subject of a massive police search operation and a reward fund offered by a local newspaper grew to $50,000, jurors were told.\n\nDonovan planned to release Shannon and then \"discover\" her, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to PA, Matthews told five versions of what happened to Shannon, ranging from being a distraught mother whose daughter had gone missing to blaming the crime on her former partner Craig Meehan and other members of his family.\n\nIt also emerged in court that Donovan abducted one of his own daughters after he became involved in a custody battle with his former wife, PA said.",

  "context": "(Travel + Leisure) -- It's no surprise: Americans are super-opinionated, especially about the cities they live in and the places they visit. In fact, their feelings are so strong that in the 2008 America's Favorite Cities survey -- conducted by travelandleisure.com and CNN Headline News -- Americans voted more than 600,000 times on 45 characteristics of 25 cities, weighing in on things like shopping, food, culture and nightlife, as well as cleanliness and affordability.\n\n\n\nNew Orleans earned No. 1 rankings for fine dining and live music.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, there was a lot of cheering from cities that clinched the No. 1 spots, like Chicago, Illinois, (dining) and Austin, Texas, (best singles scene). But we also saw a lot of upsets -- upset people, that is. After all, someone had to come in last. Unfortunately for the proud people of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, America voted them dead last in the category of attractive people. And Los Angeles, California, took the prize for least friendly city, a category that most expected New York City to sweep.\n\n\n\nNotable changes\n\n\n\nFor the winners in each category, 2008 brought some surprises. New Orleans, Louisiana, elbowed New York aside as the best city for fine dining. Las Vegas, Nevada, took the No. 1 spot for best singles scene as former No. 1 Austin tumbled to No. 5. In the cleanliness category, Portland, Oregon, swept Minneapolis, Minnesota, out of first place this year. See all the America's Favorite Cities results -- and play the new AFC game, What's YOUR Fave?\n\n\n\nBut other cities maintained their dominant positions. New York held its No. 1 ranking as the country's best spot for people-watching, while Charleston, South Carolina, was once again voted America's friendliest city.\n\n\n\nFind your vacation\n\n\n\nThere's plenty more to explore beyond the rankings. If you're in the market for a great destination, the Vacation Finder at travelandleisure.com can help you find the perfect city for your interests. Austin and New Orleans, for example, are rollicking destinations for live music, cheap ethnic food and vintage shopping. If something more high-minded is your style, check out Washington D.C. (No. 1 for museums) or New York (No. 1 for classical music).\n\n\n\nTravelers seeking the sophistication of cities paired with the exhilaration of the outdoors should head to Honolulu, Hawaii, (No. 1 for active/adventure vacations), Portland (No. 1 for public parks and access to outdoors), or Denver, Colorado, (No. 1 for athletic/active citizens).\n\n\n\nIf you're planning a trip with the kids, Orlando, Florida, is still on top, but alternatives like San Diego, California, and Washington D.C. still rate high with travelers. Seekers of romantic getaways should try their luck in Honolulu, Charleston or San Francisco, California, which hold their own particular charms.\n\n\n\nAnd what happened at the bottom of the scale? Did Philadelphia rally voters and push themselves up the attractiveness scale? Did Angelenos take the criticism about being the least-friendly city to heart and begin using a kinder, gentler salute to fellow drivers on the freeway? Read on to find out.\n\n\n\nHere are the  top three cities \u00bb in some of the categories, as voted by visitors. Visit travelandleisure.com for the full results, best and worst, for each city and category, as ranked by residents and by visitors.\n\n\n\n'What's YOUR Fave?'\n\n\n\nYou've voted on your favorite cities' characteristics, but what's America's Favorite City overall? Tell us! Vote for America's best in our new bracket game, What's YOUR Fave? Go to travelandleisure.com/afc and each week for the next four weeks, we'll pit cities head-to-head.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Six years ago Thursday, then-President George W. Bush appeared on television screens across America and somberly addressed the nation.\n\n\n\nAn Iraqi crowd pulls down a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in April 2003.\n\n\n\n\"My fellow citizens,\" he began his four-minute speech, \"at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger.\"\n\n\n\nSix years later, the conflict in Iraq drags on -- with war-fatigued Americans shoving the military operation to the deep recesses of their psyches as they grapple with an economic crisis at home.\n\n\n\nOnly 10 percent of voters questioned in exit polls during the November presidential elections picked the war as their top issue. Sixty-two percent said the economy was.\n\n\n\n\"This is already one of the longest wars in American history. There's nothing new in Iraq,\" said Steven Roberts, a professor of media studies at the George Washington University. \"We've read the stories of instability in the government a hundred times. Every single possible story has been told, and so there is enormous fatigue about Iraq.\"\n\n\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the United States has accomplished much of what it set out to do when it invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003.\n\n\n\nIraqi leader Saddam Hussein was deposed, captured, tried and hanged for a brutal and deadly crackdown against his opponents during his regime.\n\n\n\nThe rate of U.S. troop deaths has slowed.\n\n\n\nA surge of 30,000 additional troops in 2007 is credited for security gains the country has made. iReport.com: Share your salute to troops\n\n\n\nAnd a fledgling democracy is taking hold, as President Obama announced that all U.S troops will be withdrawn by the end of 2011.\n\n\n\nBut America has had to pay a steep price -- literally and figuratively -- to achieve its aims, analysts say.\n\n\n\nTaking into account operations for fiscal 2010, the conflict has racked up an $800 billion price tag since it began, the Congressional Budget Office said.\n\n\n\nBy Wednesday, 4,261 Americans had been killed in the war, according to CNN's tally. The Iraqi casualty count, while harder to ascertain because of the lack of formal record-keeping, has reached at least 128,000, by CNN's tally.\n\n\n\nAnd leaked images of prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison and America's programs of detention and torture have tarred the United States' image internationally.\n\n\n\n\"From the first step until now, they destroyed our country,\" said Sheikh Moffaq Qaraghuli, a Baghdad resident. \"Smashed. Not destroyed. Smashed.\"\n\n\n\nAs the battles rage on, researchers are still trying to gauge the damage the war has done to troops.\n\n\n\n\"I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I don't know how I got there,\" said Chris Tucker, who did three tours of duty in Iraq. \"Faces. Kids' faces. People that you have engaged or you have had contact with. ... You see your colleagues blown up. Things like that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out,\" he said. \"At least that's what we were told anyway.\"\n\n\n\nTucker received a medical discharge from the army last year and is now a police officer in Savannah, Georgia.\n\n\n\nMany in Iraq also are trying to move on, amid the constant fear of suicide attacks in their ruined cities.\n\n\n\nThe Shahbander cafe, one of Baghdad's oldest, is a favorite haunt of the city's intellectuals. Inside, photographs of five young men hang on the wall.  Watch Shahbander Cafe patrons talk about the war \u00bb\n\n\n\nAll were sons of the cafe owner, Mohammed al-Khishali -- killed in a car bombing that ripped apart the cafe in 2007.\n\n\n\nA month later, al-Khishali lost his grief-stricken wife. For almost two years, he could not bear to reopen the cafe, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I remember the tragedies every day,\" he said, as his eyes welled with tears. \"But then I decided to take a hard decision to reopen this cafe for the sake of my people, my culture.\"\n\n\n\nMany of the customers who gather there are critical of the U.S. invasion but are equally concerned about a potential withdrawal.\n\n\n\n\"Iran has ambitions toward Iraq,\" said Amer Naji, a cafe regular and a former Iraqi diplomat. \"With the Americans, they are afraid to do something aggressive against Iraq. But ... when you withdraw, that will be very dangerous.\"\n\n\n\nIraq and Iran fought a war in the 1980s that spanned eight years and killed at least a half-million people, by some estimates. The U.S. and Iraqi governments think Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard has been training militias and providing weapons, such as roadside bombs, to insurgents operating in Iraq.\n\n\n\nSo, though many Iraqis agree that 2009 is better than 2008, they worry about 2011 when the United States pulls out.\n\n\n\n\"We are hopeless,\" Qaraghuli said. \"We are hopeless.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Nic Robertson, John King, Ed Hornick and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- World champions Italy meet France Tuesday at Euro 2008 in a rematch of the 2006 World Cup final and the 2002 European Championship final -- but with very different consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nItalian players train Monday in Zurich ahead of their showdown with France.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith both sides still seeking their first win of the tournament, defeat for either in Zurich would mean certain elimination from Group C and an ignominious return home for the losing squad.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould Romania beat the Netherlands -- who are expected to rest key players having already qualified for the quarterfinals -- in the group's other match in Berne both sides face elimination regardless of the result.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench coach Raymond Domenech and Italian counterpart Roberto Donadoni could also find their jobs on the line if their players fail to meet the expectations of two countries steeped in footballing success.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing into the tournament, both the Azzurri and les Bleus -- who also met twice in qualifying -- had been considered among the favorites despite being placed in the toughest group. But shock defeats against the Dutch -- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -- and failure to beat the defensively minded Romanians has left them scrambling for survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nobody would have thought that Italy-France would be a last-ditch match,\" said Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, whose penalty save against Romania kept his country's slim hopes of making the last eight alive. \"Before the European Championship, this was supposed to be the biggest match of the group.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEither Italy and France could advance if they win and Romania are beaten or held to a draw by the Dutch. Italy could also sneak through with a score draw if Romania lose. Who will win Tuesday's crunch match between France and Italy? Have your say\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know what's at stake and we're ready to put our hearts and souls into it. For us, this is already a final,\" said Donadoni, who replaced Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi following Italy's win on penalties over France two years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Both sides will be extremely motivated and will try to win. It should be exciting. I can't wait for the game to start.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmitting that both sides' fate was out of their own hands, Domenech recognized that France's qualification hopes hung by a thread with the Dutch unlikely to chase victory against a Romanian side they failed to beat in qualifying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They (the Netherlands) won't play with as much energy as they did against us and Italy,\" said Domenech following his side's defeat by injury. \"It's very difficult to imagine Holland beating Romania now... We have to forget the other game completely. We still have a tiny chance but it will only happen if we win our game.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDomenech is still without veteran midfielder and captain Patrick Vieira of Italian champions Inter Milan, who has failed to feature in the tournament since picking up a thigh injury in training two weeks ago. Lyon striker Karim Benzema was tipped to return to the side after missing the game against the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly could recall forward Antonio Cassano in place of veteran Alessandro Del Piero while AC Milan midfield pair Gennaro Gattuso and Massimo Ambrosini could also return to the starting lineup.\n\n\n\n\n\nRomanian coach Victor Piturca said he expected a tough match against the Netherlands despite the Dutch having already sealed their place in the last eight and Romania's victory over Marco van Basten's side in Bucharest during qualifying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had some experienced players who knew Dutch football well and that helped us with our tactics against them in the qualifiers,\" said Piturca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, that wasn't a good time for the Netherlands whereas right now, unfortunately for us, they are in extremely good form... We know the different scenarios but by the end of the game I hope we will have qualified because we deserve it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe runners-up in Group C will face Spain, the winners of Group D, in Saturday's quarterfinal in Vienna. The Dutch's next opponents will be the determined by the result of Wednesday's clash between Russia and Sweden.",

  "context": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico has announced plans to raise tariffs on almost 90 U.S. exports, Mexican and U.S. officials confirmed Monday.\n\n\n\nMexico's state-run news agency says tariffs are in retaliation for cancellation of a U.S. trucking project.\n\n\n\nThe new trade measures are in retaliation for the cancellation earlier this year of a U.S. commercial trucking project and will target U.S. industrial and agricultural products delivered to Mexico, Mexico's state-run news agency said.\n\n\n\nMexico's Economic Secretary Gerardo Ruiz Mateos called the cancellation of the program a breach of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the agency said.\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the trucking project was killed in the 2009 omnibus appropriations bill, but President Barack Obama has asked his administration to create a new program.\n\n\n\n\"Congress has opposed the project in the past because of concerns about the process that led to the program's establishment and its operation,\" Gibbs said.\n\n\n\nThe project allowed a small number of Mexican trucks to enter the United States beyond the normal commercial zones, and allowed some U.S. trucks the same privilege in Mexico.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, warned that the Mexican action would harm American businesses.\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is a predictable reaction by the Mexican government to a policy that now puts the United States in clear violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and was inappropriately inserted into the omnibus appropriations bill,\" McCain said after learning of the Mexican government's plans.\n\n\n\nMcCain said Washington \"must take steps to prevent escalation of further protectionist measures -- actions that only serve to harm American business during these tough economic times when these businesses need a worldwide marketplace to prosper.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is another reason why the president should have vetoed the omnibus spending bill,\" McCain added.\n\n\n\nMexico's intentions to raise tariffs on U.S. goods \"is an absurd overreaction to the shutdown of the unsafe cross-border trucking pilot program,\" Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said.\n\n\n\n\"The right response from Mexico would be to make sure its drivers and trucks are safe enough to use our highways without endangering our drivers,\" Hoffa said in a statement issued by the union. \"The border must stay closed until Mexico holds up its end of the bargain.\"",

But the sheriff said investigators can tie the pair \"to enough significant events and instances in this case that would lead a reasonable person to believe that they have an association with these murders.\"\n\n\n\nA third person sought for questioning had not been found, Morgan said.\n\n\n\nThe Billingses died in what police are calling a home invasion, but investigators have not said whether the couple was robbed.\n\n\n\nEight children found at the home after the shootings are being cared for at an undisclosed location, Morgan said. The children, ranging in age from infant to about 11 years old, were not injured, police said.\n\n\n\nTwelve of the Billingses' 16 children were adopted, some of them with special needs, the Pensacola News Journal reported.\n\n\n\nEmergency personnel and police went to the home after receiving a call just before 8 p.m. Thursday about shots being fired, said Escambia County Police spokesman Sgt. Ted Roy. An employee of the couple found their bodies, Roy said.\n\n\n\nBeulah is west of Pensacola, near the Alabama state line.\n\n\n\nCNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.",

As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney.\n\n\"That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after,\" Gortney said.\n\nThe United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia.\n\nThere are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries.\n\nPirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 \u00bb\n\nPirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country.\n\nGortney said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of Somalia less than one percent, but it won't be stopped until piracy is \"disincentivized.\"",

  "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi officials Monday condemned the weekend killings of eight civilians during a Baghdad street battle involving American security contractors and said they would shut down Blackwater, the company involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Blackwater helicopter hovers over Baghdad in July 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackwater said its employees acted in self-defense. The U.S. State Department said it plans to investigate what it calls a \"terrible incident.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to express regret for the weekend killings, both governments said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the fatalities, 14 people were wounded, most of them civilians, an Iraqi official said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday's firefight took place near Nusoor Square, an area that straddles the predominantly Sunni Arab neighborhoods of Mansour and Yarmouk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ministry said the incident began around midday, when a convoy of sport utility vehicles came under fire from unidentified gunmen in the square. The men in the SUVs, described by witnesses as Westerners, returned fire, the ministry said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackwater's employees were protecting a U.S. official when they were hit by \"a large explosive device, then repeated small-arms fire -- and to the point where it disabled one of the vehicles, and the vehicle had to be towed out of the firefight,\" said Marty Strong, vice president of Blackwater USA.\n\n\n\n\n\nA senior industry source said Blackwater guards had escorted a State Department group to a meeting with U.S. Agency for International Development officials in Mansour before the shootings.\n\n\n\n\n\nA car bomb went off about 80 feet (25 meters) from the meeting site and the contractors started evacuating the State Department officials, he said. A State Department report on the attack said the convoy came under fire from an estimated eight to 10 people, some in Iraqi police uniforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guards called for backup, at one point finding their escape route blocked by an Iraqi quick-reaction force that pointed heavy machine guns at one vehicle in the convoy. A U.S. Army force, backed by air cover, arrived about half an hour later to escort the convoy back to the Green Zone, the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\nA team from another security company passed through the area shortly after the street battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our people saw a couple of cars destroyed,\" Carter Andress, CEO of American-Iraqi Solutions Groups, told CNN on Monday. \"Dead bodies, wounded people being evacuated. The U.S. military had moved in and secured the area.  It was not a good scene.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Interior Ministry spokesman, Brig. Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf, said, \"We have revoked Blackwater's license to operate in Iraq. As of now they are not allowed to operate anywhere in the Republic of Iraq. The investigation is ongoing, and all those responsible for Sunday's killing will be referred to Iraqi justice.\"  Watch why the Interior Ministry revoked Blackwater's license \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany and State Department officials said they had not been notified of any order to that effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nRice and al-Maliki agreed to conduct \"a fair and transparent investigation into this incident\" and punish those responsible, the prime minister's office said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Diplomatic Security Service has launched an official investigation, a review that will be supported by the Multi-National Forces-Iraq, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The secretary wants to make sure we do everything we possibly can to avoid innocent loss of life,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCormack said that while the United States tries to avoid innocent casualties, \"we are fighting people who don't play by any rules\" and have no problem killing innocent civilians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weekend's incident raised concerns in the U.S. Congress about the use of private security guards. Rep. Henry Waxman, whose House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held hearings on contractor operations in February, said he will hold new hearings into the issue in light of Sunday's shootings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The controversy over Blackwater is an unfortunate demonstration of the perils of excessive reliance on private security contractors,\" said Waxman, D-California.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackwater, founded in 1997 and based in Moyock, North Carolina, is one of many security firms contracted by the U.S. government during the Iraq war. An estimated 25,000 employees of private security firms are working in Iraq, guarding diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials. As many as 200 are believed to have been killed on the job, according to U.S. congressional reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Blackwater personnel died in a grisly attack in Iraq more than three years ago that sparked shock and outrage in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Americans working as private security personnel for Blackwater, all of whom were military veterans, were ambushed, killed and mutilated in March 2004 in Falluja, west of Baghdad.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople close to the company estimate it has lost about 30 employees during the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraqi authorities have issued previous complaints about shootings by private military contractors, the Congressional Research Service reported in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most recently, a news article discussing an incident in which a Blackwater guard shot dead an Iraqi driver in May 2007 quoted an Iraqi official's statement that the Iraqi Interior Ministry had received four previous complaints of shootings involving Blackwater employees,\" the congressional service report said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Research Service report cited other concerns, such as \"the apparent lack of a practical means to hold contractors accountable under U.S. law for abuses and other transgressions and the possibility that they could be prosecuted by foreign courts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reported added, \"Iraqi courts do not have jurisdiction to prosecute contractors without the permission of the relevant member country of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors fall under Justice Department and FBI jurisdiction for alleged crimes, said a Pentagon official, who confirmed the accuracy of the congressional report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Elise Labott, Cal Perry, Suzanne Simons, Barbara Starr and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",

  "context": "MARDAN, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A family of 18 Pakistani men, women and children trudges down a dirt road toward a refugee camp.\n\n\n\nThese children are among the thousands of refugees this week at the Jalozai camp in western Pakistan.\n\n\n\nAdolescent girls carry infants on their hips, while the men lug bundles of belongings on their backs.\n\n\n\n\"Come, stay close to me,\" said one woman wrapped in brightly colored robes, speaking to three children trailing behind her.\n\n\n\n\"This one is empty,\" a white-bearded Pakistani police officer tells the family, pointing toward a tent.\n\n\n\nThe women and children scramble under the canvas flap, as Salar Khan explains what led his family to flee to Mardan.\n\n\n\n\"Mortars destroyed three houses in my village,\" he said. \"It was dangerous. A piece of shrapnel almost pierced my child's leg.\"\n\n\n\nKhan said his family left their home Wednesday morning in Sultanwas, a town in Buner district.\n\n\n\nNow, they are living in Mardan's rapidly growing tent city of more than 1,400 other displaced Pakistanis. Five days ago, it was an empty field.  Watch as CNN's Ivan Watson tours a refugee camp \u00bb\n\n\n\nKhan's family has joined tens of thousands of other Pakistanis fleeing south to escape the escalating conflict between the military and Taliban militants in northwestern Pakistan. Meanwhile, columns of Pakistani troops in military trucks head in the opposite direction, hauling field guns north toward the conflict zone.\n\n\n\nPakistani families have fled the area any way they can: on foot, by hitching rides on the back of trucks and by stowing their belongings on the roofs of cars.\n\n\n\nAs fighting has spread from the districts of Buner and Lower Dir to the Taliban stronghold in the Swat Valley, camps for displaced people are cropping up across northwest Pakistan.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations said the new exodus is exacerbating an already existing humanitarian crisis. Since August, the U.N. has registered more than 500,000 Pakistanis forced to flee their homes by fighting in other northwestern parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\"Last year ... 4 million people worldwide lost their homes, out of which you have half a million displaced in Pakistan,\" said Manuel Bessler, a top U.N. official in Islamabad.\n\n\n\nBessler spoke on a rooftop, overlooking the sprawling Jalozai refugee camp in western Pakistan.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, the camp housed refugees from neighboring Afghanistan. The Afghans are now gone, replaced by more then 49,000 Pakistanis.\n\n\n\nAdministrators are preparing space for 35,000 others. With help from U.N. agencies, the Pakistani government and other aid organizations, residents get access to medical care, children's schools and training programs to teach them how to rebuild their damaged homes if and when they get to return.\n\n\n\nTensions have been building in the Jalozai camp. Two months ago, Pakistani police shot and killed one demonstrator after residents protested, blocking roads, throwing stones and demanding compensation for homes damaged by the fighting.\n\n\n\nThis week, a crowd of several hundred agitated men gathered at the entrance, angry about a delay of several days in the monthly distribution of food aid. Some accused camp administrators of corruption, allegations that aid workers have denied.\n\n\n\n\"The wheat we've been given is substandard, and people are getting sick instead of being fed,\" said one man named Gulzada.\n\n\n\n\"Our houses have been destroyed,\" said another man called Anwar. \"There's no tea, no sugar, no wheat, no lentils. All that we have are the clothes we are wearing.\"\n\n\n\nA fresh wave of displaced Pakistanis will only aggravate tensions, said Bessler, the U.N. official.\n\n\n\n\"This is a factor that is destabilizing not only in the camp but in the country as a whole,\" he warned.\n\n\n\nOnly a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Pakistanis are ending up in camps. Many more have settled with host families or have resorted to paying rent in other cities.\n\n\n\nThe influx of ethnic Pashtuns from northwest Pakistan upset the delicate demographic balance last month in the port city of Karachi. That led to ethnic clashes between Pashtuns and the resident Muhajir community, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 people.\n\n\n\nMany more Pakistanis are unable to leave the conflict area, according to Sebastian Brack, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Islamabad.\n\n\n\n\"There is a serious humanitarian crisis under way,\" Brack said. \"There is serious fighting going on. There will be massive displacement. Because of the curfew, [many] have not been able to leave yet.\"\n\n\n\nIn this moment of crisis, some homeless Pakistanis are turning to a higher power.\n\n\n\n\"Whenever it is God's will, we will go back to our homes,\" says Mohammed Munir, an elderly man who fled with his family from the Buner district to the new camp in Mardan three days ago. \"And we pray to Allah that he will protect us. It's up to Allah. We can't do anything.\"\n\n\n\nThe man kneeled and prayed in the grass outside the entrance of a tent that his family now calls home.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- To be a Texas Rangers baseball fan doesn't compare to the prestige of growing up in the shadows of Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park or Wrigley Field. The pinstriped jerseys, classic uniforms and ball caps of those Major League Baseball teams are timeless and have become iconic touchstones in pop culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to be a baseball fan if you root for teams with rich history like the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and both Chicago teams, the Cubs and White Sox.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseball purists must have cringed back in 1972 when the Rangers unveiled the team logo of a baseball wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling the Rangers your team meant you truly loved baseball.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the power of a good luck charm?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Yankees spent decades playing in the \"House that Babe Ruth Built\" while the Rangers spent most of my childhood playing in an uninspired location. The \"stadium\" was a converted minor-league field that looked like an open-air county arena better suited for rodeos than baseball games. But it was our Ebbets Field.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust hours before Opening Day in 1975, a helicopter was brought in to hover over the wet field to dry out two days worth of rain. The result? The chopper crashed and gashed the field just beyond third base.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would take another 20 years for the Texas Rangers to taste the playoffs. But the \"Curse of the Rotor Blade\" doesn't have the same mystique as the Red Sox's \"Curse of the Bambino\" or the Cubs' \"Curse of the Billy Goat.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rangers team was a collection of misfit has-beens and never-would-bes who made every kid think, \"If these guys can be ballplayers, surely I can be one, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 12, 1991, was my chance to impress the Rangers scouts. Before the game, I was invited to play in a fly-ball catching contest. After hearing the stadium announcer call my name, I trotted out onto the hallowed grass of Arlington Stadium. A pitching machine launched the first two fly balls toward me, and with thousands of people watching, I snagged both balls.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more catch and the entire stadium would be rewarded with a free medium soft drink from Wendy's. This is where I learned never to underestimate America's love for winning free stuff no matter how trivial it might be. The crowd came to its feet and erupted into the loudest cheers I think I've ever heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe machine launched a major league pop fly that seemed to take forever to come down. As I started to fall over I put my glove up and felt the ball smack the leather webbing. I got up, looked into the glove and it was still there. That was the first time I was able to scream, \"Free drinks for everyone!\" I ran off the field in glory. I still have that ball. I had all my buddies with me that day autograph it, just like real ball players do.\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago has its \"Lovable Losers\" in the Cubs. Rangers fans needed Lone Star beer to love its losers. Even the most fanatic baseball fan is hard-pressed to name the players who we called our own. Pete O'Brien, Larry Parrish, Oddibe McDowell, Jeff Russell, Gary Ward. Who? We watched a guy named Charlie Hough throw 50 mph knuckleballs and then puff on cigarettes in the dugout between innings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to the stadium and bought $4 outfield seats. All for the privilege of watching terrible baseball in the scorching Texas heat, suffering third-degree burns from sitting on the metal bleacher seats.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn those early years, the season of hope was usually short-lived. You could count on the Rangers to be out of playoff contention by the end of May, which was fine. We had bigger things to focus on, like the Dallas Cowboys packing their bags for training camp. The losing kept the bleacher seats cheap, which was fine for most fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best days of my life was witnessing the Rangers battle the Red Sox on April 30, 1989, on my father's birthday. I still have the ticket stub. Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan pitched for the Rangers, and future accused steroid user Roger Clemens pitched for the Red Sox. An epic matchup that turned out to be an epic game.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe witnessed poetic pitching. Ryan struck out 11 batters. I was in awe. Ryan and Clemens cruised but the Red Sox had a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the eighth inning. Until our favorite Cuban-exile came to the plate, Rafael Palmeiro stroked a beautiful two-run home run down the right field. The Rangers won 2-1.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside the stadium after the game, I got Nolan Ryan to autograph my baseball, and then I tried to get Roger Clemens' autograph and learned a valuable lesson from my dad. Clemens was intimidating. My dad patted me on the back and said, \"Don't be afraid. Go up to him and ask him for an autograph.\" With quivering hands I gave Clemens the ball. Clemens took the ball, and now I can say I'm the proud owner of Roger Clemens scribble. Most days I've spent watching Rangers baseball haven't compared to that day. But we Cubans love our baseball, and we'll take it any way we can get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, baseball started to change. The old stadium was bulldozed and replaced with a shrine more fitting of a noble baseball team. The Rangers flirted with the playoffs three times in the late-1990s. They played 10 games and lost nine. It's the kind of angst and teasing that only Cubs and Red Sox fans can truly appreciate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat brush with success didn't last long. The Rangers ushered in another decade of abysmal baseball that took the team to the brink of bankruptcy. That is until February 2008, when Nolan Ryan and the new ownership group rode into town and saved the day. In 2010, under Ryan's leadership, the Rangers made it to the World Series for the first time in franchise history.\n\n\n\n\n\nSI.com: Rangers' Ron Washington: World Series hero or goat\n\n\n\n\n\nThese modern-day Rangers are a different story. The players probably aren't as fun and crazy as the misfits who sported the long-gone logo of the baseball wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat, but the team's manager, Ron Washington, is a throwback to the good old days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington dances, struts, mangles the English language in a beautiful way and frantically chomps on sunflower seeds. He is a baseball genius with the heart of a 12-year-old kid cheering the team. In Ron Washington's world, \"That's the way baseball go!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the Texas Rangers are on the brink of being World Series champions. The Cardinals, Yankees, Red Sox and Cubs fans look on with envy at a franchise that spent decades as a laughingstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one ever imagined we could even have a World Series parade to plan. Arlington, Texas, (where the Rangers play) has a downtown not worthy of a World Series party. But there is a Six Flags amusement park next to the stadium. Instead of a parade, I think fans should ride the roller coasters with the players. That would be a fitting way to celebrate a tear-jerking relationship full of ups and downs.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- At least 30 people died and 70 were wounded in shelling on a marketplace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Thursday, according to journalists and emergency services.\n\n\n\nMembers of Islamist militia Al-Shaabab patrol Bakara Market in Mogadishu, Somalia, earlier this month.\n\n\n\nA local journalist called the rocket fire on Bakara market \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\n\n\"This was the most brutal shelling,\" according to an ambulance service representative who said they had picked up 61 wounded, but expect the number to climb. Other victims were being brought to hospitals by family and friends.\n\n\n\nThe source of the shelling could not immediately be determined.\n\n\n\nJournalists saw shell fire coming from AMISOM -- the African Union Mission in Somalia -- strongholds in a fortified district of the capital and from near the airport. AMISOM is the only force in the area believed to have the firepower capable of such an intense attack. However, AMISOM denied any involvement in the incident.\n\n\n\nThe African Union has a 3,400-member peacekeeping force in Somalia, made up of troops from Burundi and Uganda. It operates under a U.N. mandate to support Somalia's transitional federal government.\n\n\n\nThe peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace. It is the de facto military force of the weak, transitional Somali government.\n\n\n\nAfrican Union forces have been battling an al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia in Somalia called Al-Shaabab.\n\n\n\nThe United States is supporting the Somali government's fight against the insurgents, including providing weapons to government forces. Al-Shaabab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network.\n\n\n\nThe United States is concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power in early 2007. Ethiopia invaded Somalia with the support of Somalia's weak transitional government.\n\n\n\nJournalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.",

  "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The day I interviewed Neil Diamond, he was sitting in a little room to the side of a studio, and a makeup artist was smacking him in the face with a powder puff. He was wearing a white wife-beater T-shirt and looked like he wanted to flee.\n\n\n\nNeil Diamond is riding high with a huge world tour, a successful album and a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nIt was November, and Diamond had just come off the first two legs of his biggest world tour yet -- with 64 shows in 50 cities and nine countries already under his belt. In a moment, he would step in front of a camera to begin a round of 70 or so interviews -- beamed via satellite to local television stations -- to talk up the remaining 20 dates, where he'd thrill diehard fans with such nuggets as \"Cherry Cherry,\" \"Song Sung Blue\" and \"Sweet Caroline.\"\n\n\n\nOurs was the only in-person interview he -- or someone in his camp -- had agreed to do. The singer-songwriter (who turned 68 on January 24) stepped into the studio, a man ready for his close-up. He had slipped a black button-down shirt over his T-shirt, and suddenly he looked like Neil Diamond -- the same Neil Diamond who next week will be feted by The Recording Academy as its \"2009 MusiCares Person of the Year,\" joining an elite club that includes Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Sting, Bono and Quincy Jones.\n\n\n\nHe's working on a follow-up to last year's CD, the Rick Rubin-produced \"Home Before Dark\" -- which earned Diamond his first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. That album came after 2005's \"12 Songs,\" also produced by Rubin, which re-invigorated his recording career. As for live performance, he's rarely had problems filling arenas -- but he remembers when he did.  Watch Diamond talk about giving back \u00bb\n\n\n\nCNN: The man in black. This has become quite the trademark.\n\n\n\nNeil Diamond: Yeah. I still wear black, but I got sparkly somewhere along the way -- especially if you are playing in an 18,000-seat arena, you like to be seen by somebody in the back.\n\n\n\nCNN: I've been to a Neil Diamond concert, and everybody stands up, and they sing every word to every song. Don't you ever want to tell them, \"I'm singing -- listen!\"\n\n\n\nDiamond: No, I don't -- but I did in the very beginning when I first realized on my first few records that people were singing along. I thought, \"You shouldn't be singing. That's my job. Let me sing and you listen.\" But then I realized that it's a compliment. They knew the music, they loved it and they wanted to sing. So I said, \"All right, let's sing together.\" [chuckles]\n\n\n\nCNN: Whenever you hit the road, you're one of the year's top ticket draws and play to more than a million fans per tour. [Diamond had the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2008, taking in $60 million in ticket sales.]\n\n\n\nDiamond: It's truly not until the last leg that you finally get the show down. You are relaxed with it, you are not worried about the intricacies of the show, and the last shows are always the best and the most fun.\n\n\n\nCNN: After 40 years in the business, do you still get nervous?\n\n\n\nDiamond: I don't know if it's nerves. I get excited. I want things to go right. I want the audience to love the show.\n\n\n\nCNN: For this tour, you've donated all the proceeds from merchandise sales [T-shirts, programs and other souvenir items] to the victims of Hurricane Ike in Texas. We're talking about a figure that's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars.\n\n\n\nDiamond: Hurricane Ike hit southern Texas so fiercely [in September 2008, while Diamond was on tour], and has been forgotten about by the rest of the country -- but these people are still in desperate straits, and are in dire need of our help.\n\n\n\nAnd I saw what was going on. The mayor of Houston took me around, and he told me about it and introduced me to some people. The next day, I drove down to some of the hardest-hit areas, and I just felt that I had to do something, and I felt that maybe my audience would help me out with it.\n\n\n\nSo we just say the merchandise and whatever you buy goes down to those people to rebuild their homes. They are still living in tents and cars down there. So to all the people down in Oak Island, Galveston, Galveston Bay and Houston, help is on the way -- and that's the message that I want to bring and spread around. The Eagles just made a substantial donation to this fund.\n\n\n\nCNN: Has that inspired new songwriting for you?\n\n\n\nDiamond: I don't know if it has inspired new songwriting -- I don't do a lot of writing when I am out touring -- but it has inspired a reality in me of what's going on. You tend to live in a bubble when you are traveling and touring.\n\n\n\nI missed the election completely. I actually worked and performed election night. The wonderful people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, came and filled the place, and I said to them, \"I appreciate you coming down, because there is something really good on television.\"\n\n\n\nI missed the election completely. I got off the stage and tuned into the concession speech. But I heard it was very dramatic, and I'm happy with the outcome. You tend to miss things when you're on the road.\n\n\n\nCNN: Right before the Grammys, you're being honored by The Recording Academy as its \"2009 MusiCares Person of the Year.\"\n\n\n\nDiamond: Well, it's a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you. [Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career, but has only won one award.] But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit -- that big dinner -- is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times. It's not the most secure job in the world, and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated. It's a cause that's very close to my heart. I have been very fortunate, and I have been successful.\n\n\n\nCNN: When you tour, you sell out 20,000-seat arenas -- but do you ever worry about a day when you might walk out on stage and there are only two or three people in the audience?\n\n\n\nDiamond: Well, that did happen to me very early in my career. So yeah, that has occurred to me. I'm always a little amazed that people show up, and I don't know where they came from -- but I'm thrilled that they are there.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you ever wonder what you would have done had this all not worked out?\n\n\n\nDiamond: I do, and I don't like any of the choices that I would have made, or any of the places that I would have been.\n\n\n\nCNN: I hear you earned a fencing scholarship to NYU.\n\n\n\nDiamond: Yeah, I did. But you can't make a living as a fencer these days.\n\n\n\nCNN: So this is definitely much better.\n\n\n\nDiamond: Yes, this is a lot better. I love singing. I have been singing since I was a little boy, so to make a life in music as a writer and as a singer -- I think I have the best job in the world.\n\n\n\nCNN: At the end of the tour, you're only taking two days off, and then you begin working on your next album. Don't you believe in vacations?\n\n\n\nDiamond: I'm not the kind of guy that's good at laying on the beach for too long. If I'm laying on the beach, it's with a guitar and a legal pad, and I'm thinking about music.",

  "context": "Cusco, Peru (CNN) -- Authorities in Peru have rescued the last of hundreds of travelers who had been stranded by flooding in a town near one of South America's most popular tourist destinations, a government official said Friday.\n\n\n\nTourism Minister Martin Perez said 1,460 tourists were evacuated from Aguas Calientes, bringing the total rescued during the past three days to 4,005 -- 3,500 of them tourists.\n\n\n\nThirteen helicopters in 268 flights took them to the city of Cusco, though one group of Colombians indicated they had not wanted to leave, he said.\n\n\n\nDays of heavy rain had triggered flash floods and landslides around Machu Picchu, the ruins of an Incan settlement in southern Peru's Andes Mountains.\n\n\n\nThe floods closed roads, bridges and rail lines, stranding tourists from around the world in the small town closest to the ruins. They also killed at least seven people, including an Argentine tourist, according to news reports.\n\n\n\nThe tourists became stranded after a landslide early in the week blocked a rail line to Cusco, the nearest major city, said Martin Perez, Peru's minister of foreign trade and tourism, according to the state-run Andina news agency.\n\n\n\nPeruvian authorities said they have given priority to children, the elderly and the ill, regardless of their nationality.\n\n\n\nAuthorities estimated that 10,000 people were affected by the rain and 2,000 homes were ruined in and around Machu Picchu.\n\n\n\nThe Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in two regions around Machu Picchu -- Cusco and Apurimac.\n\n\n\nThe floods have damaged thousands of acres of crop land, washed out about a dozen bridges and damaged several highways.\n\n\n\nDon Jacinto, whose parents and grandparents lived in one affected area, said his relatives could not recall the rivers ever raging so strongly.\n\n\n\nMachu Picchu is an ancient city on a mountain in the Andes, standing 8,000 feet (2,430 meters) above sea level in a tropical mountain forest.\n\n\n\nKnown as the \"Lost City of the Incas,\" Machu Picchu attracts tens of thousands of international tourists every year.\n\n\n\nCNN's Maria Elena Belaunde in Cusco and journalist Claudia Cisneros in Lima contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- President Obama will sign an executive order establishing a presidential commission to investigate the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, an administration official said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nEight U.S. senators called earlier Monday for an independent federal investigation of whether oil giant BP violated civil or criminal laws in connection with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt hasn't been determined when Obama will make the announcement of the presidential commission or when he'll sign the executive order, said the official, who did not want to speak on the record ahead of an announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The commission will take into account the investigations under way concerning the causes of the spill and explore a range of issues,\" the official said. In particular, the commission's inquiry will focus on industry practices, rig safety, regulatory regimes, federal governmental oversight -- including the structure and functions of the Minerals Management Service -- and environmental review and other protections, the official said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Obama harshly criticized the companies involved in the spill, which threatens to become one of the nation's worst environmental disasters, and pledged to break up what he called the cozy relationship between regulators and the oil industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn testimony on Capitol Hill, BP touted its progress toward plugging the spill, but a top Obama administration official said the disaster is far from over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials grilled on oil spill\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are in the middle of this crisis. We are not at the beginning,\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate committee Monday afternoon. \"We've been at it a month almost, but we are not near the end as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBP has successfully inserted a siphon into the damaged riser pipe from the underwater well at the heart of the spill. The procedure has allowed the company to collect more than 1,000 barrels (42,000 gallons) of oil a day that would otherwise spill into the Gulf, said Doug Suttles, the company's chief operating officer. That, combined with the use of chemical dispersants to break up the spill, has reduced the amount of oil reaching the surface, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This [is] probably the smallest amount of oil I've seen on the surface since the effort began,\" Suttles said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe well had been spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day into the Gulf since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Eleven workers are presumed dead after the sinking, and the cause has not been determined.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast, and tar balls related to the spill have turned up as far east as Dauphin Island, Alabama.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome estimates put the amount of oil gushing from the well far higher than the 5,000-barrel-per-day estimate made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a few days after the spill began. Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamantha Joye, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia, told CNN's \"American Morning\" that the size of the suspected plumes is hard to determine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing like it has really ever been seen in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico before,\" she said. \"It's not only a large feature, but it's a very complex feature. There's a lot of vertical structure to it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed. Charlie Henry, a scientific adviser from NOAA, said descriptions of \"layers of oil\" beneath the Gulf were \"totally untrue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were able to detect what we think is hydrocarbons in the water column. It was stated as oil, but it wasn't like oil you could see,\" Henry told reporters Monday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers were looking into the effects of the undersea dispersants used to break up the oil near the mouth of the well, nearly a mile beneath the surface, NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement issued Monday. But Lubchenco said the agency does not consider dispersants -- which have their own hazards -- \"a silver bullet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are used to move us towards the lesser of two environmental outcomes. Until the flow of oil is stemmed, we must take every responsible action to reduce the impact of the oil,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuttles said the next step in capping the well is a \"top kill\" procedure, in which a large amount of heavy \"mud\" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is the method we think we will be deploying later this week or this weekend,\" Suttles said. Another option -- putting debris in the well to stop the flow -- may also be utilized, he said. And once the leak is sealed, \"We intend to fill up the bottom of this well with cement and it will never be produced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBP, as the well's owner, is responsible for stopping the underwater gusher and paying for the cleanup, and Napolitano said the company has paid more than $9.6 million so far without denying a claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nBP America CEO Lamar McKay, who appeared with Napolitano before the Homeland Security Committee, said the company was concentrating on plugging the leak and limiting the economic damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will put blame, liability, and those kind of things over to the side. That's not our concern right now,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge oil plumes may pose additional threat\n\n\n\n\n\nThe April 20 explosion aboard Deepwater Horizon has left BP, rig owner-operator Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton pointing fingers at each other over the cause of the blast. The doomed rig's chief electronics technician told the CBS news program \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday that Transocean was being pushed to complete the well quickly because it was taking longer than expected -- an allegation Suttles would not discuss during an appearance on \"American Morning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know people are talking about various things that occurred that night on the rig, but I actually haven't seen any of the results of these interviews or investigations ... I don't actually have any knowledge that that was the case,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA top official of the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore drilling is retiring a month earlier than planned.\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Oynes told his bosses after the Deepwater Horizon explosion that he would retire at the end of June, an administration official told CNN, but announced Monday that he would step down at the end of May instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nOynes has been associate director of the Minerals Management Service's Offshore Minerals Management Program since 2007. In the past, critics have accused MMS of being too cozy with the industries it regulates. A 2008 report from the Interior Department's inspector-general found MMS employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar last week announced he would split MMS into separate divisions -- one for regulating offshore oil drilling and the other for collecting royalties from oil companies. Salazar is scheduled to appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday, while Elizabeth Birnbaum, the current MMS director, will appear before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's David Mattingly and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A judge on Thursday denied a request for President Barack Obama to testify at a court martial for a U.S. Army flight surgeon who refused to deploy to Afghanistan until he saw proof that Obama was born in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, said any evidence or witnesses related to Obama's citizenship is irrelevant to the charges against Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin, who has 17 years of service in the U.S. military.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter failing to deploy with his unit in April, Lakin was charged with missing a movement, disobeying a lawful order and dereliction of duty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice says the maximum punishment for both offenses -- missing his plane and disobeying lawful orders -- is a dishonorable discharge and up to two years in confinement. A guilty verdict could also result in forfeiture of Lakin's pay, which totals $7,959 a month, according to a charge sheet provided by a group sponsoring his defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nLakin's lawyers argued that all military orders stem from the commander-in-chief. Without evidence that Obama is eligible to be president, they say, the doctor's deployment order was illegal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to putting Obama on their witness list, Lakin's lawyers had asked Lind to order Obama's official birth records from Hawaii be brought to court for trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the president is ineligible, you need to know that,\" Lakin's civilian attorney, Paul Jensen, told Lind. \"Col. Lakin needs to know that, the government needs to know that, America needs to know that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prosecutors in the case argued that Obama's eligibility is not relevant because the officers who ordered Lakin to go to Fort Campbell and then ordered him to answer questions about why he didn't go were his proper superiors in the military chain of command, and they gave him legal orders. Jensen later conceded that point.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge ruled that the matter of Obama's eligibility is not relevant because he did not give any orders in the case. She pointed out that while the president is commander-in-chief of the military, it is Congress that is constitutionally empowered to raise armies, pay them and equip them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny contention that any orders are invalid if the president is ineligible \"is erroneous,\" the judge said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLind also said that military law says that a soldier's personal beliefs or convictions are not sufficient to allow that soldier to determine that an order is illegal. The soldier has to have \"no rational doubt\" that the order is illegal before he or she can ignore it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally she ruled that a military court martial is not the forum in which to determine a president's eligibility, because the Constitution says only Congress has the power to impeach and remove the president.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterward, Jensen said he respected the judge's ruling, but called it distressing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It completely deprives us of any opportunity to present a defense in this case,\" Jensen said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court martial is set to begin in October, but Jensen said he's not giving up on the matter of Obama's eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will be giving the Army Court of Criminal Appeals in the next week or two the opportunity to take up the issue, and we are going to fight on for justice to be served in this case.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLakin is among 27 percent of Americans who doubt or deny that Obama is American-born, according to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. They compose the birther movement, which demands that Obama present a birth certificate signed by the doctor who delivered him in 1961.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN and other news organizations have thoroughly debunked the rumors about the president's birthplace. The Obama campaign released a copy of a birth record issued by the state in 2007, called a \"certification of live birth,\" and allowed reporters to examine the document in person in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Hawaiian state officials issued a statement that they had personally viewed the president's original Hawaiian birth record, called a \"certificate of live birth,\" and verified it to be authentic. State law bars the release of the original certificate. In addition, two Hawaiian newspapers ran notices in 1961 announcing Obama's birth in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A report from Canadian researchers published Monday says there is not enough sound evidence to support routine screening of children for autism, but several autism experts are questioning the paper's conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article, published in the journal Pediatrics, is based on a review of existing studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics -- which publishes the journal -- recommends that doctors screen children for autism during regular checkups at the ages of 18 and 24 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 110 children has some form of autism, a handful of different neuro-developmental disorders that cause mild to severe social, communication and behavioral problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday's report questions whether screening for autism is the right approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Good screening tools and efficacious treatment [for autism] is lacking,\" it says, adding that \"none of the autism screening tests currently available has been shown to be able to fulfill the properties of accuracy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report's authors are cerebral palsy experts at McMaster University in Ontario.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut several leading autism experts -- who diagnose, treat and study children with autism -- said they were puzzled and concerned by the new report's conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By screening for autism at an early age, children are able to begin intervention as soon as possible,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the Autism Speaks advocacy group. \"Studies have shown that early intervention results in significant increases in cognitive and language abilities, and adaptive behavior, and gives children the best chance for a positive outcome.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Patricia Manning-Courtney, a developmental pediatrician and the director of the autism center at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, said the study goes completely \"against the experience in this field\" in which experts have said early intervention or therapy can yield the most benefits for a child later in life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have never, ever met a family that regretted being told their child may have symptoms -- not a single family,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a diagnosis of autism is later found to be inaccurate, the child isn't harmed by the therapy given in the interim, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Manning-Courtney said she's met thousands of parents whose children were diagnosed at an older age \"who wished they were listened to sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Charles Cowan, medical director of the Seattle Children's Autism Center, echoed Manning-Courtney's concerns, saying the report's conclusions seem to negate well established research and recommendations from people who treat children with autism, including the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore research is needed, he said, but just because all the necessary research hasn't been done yet, it \"does not negate the benefit of screening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Paul Lipkin, who chaired the academy's 2006 committee that recommended the screenings at 18 and 24 months, said the conclusions in Monday's report overlooked significant benefits to screening.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors are also identifying problems beyond autism, including a wide range of developmental disorders, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLipkin, the director of the Center for Development and Learning at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, acknowledged that screening tools aren't perfect, but noted that doctors combine them with continuous surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are hoping that the combination can then overcome any of the limits of the tests or surveillance. The combination is better than either one of them,\" he said, adding that some newer studies, not cited in the Canadian study, suggest that \"it does look like we're on the right track.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the apparent criticisms of screening in Monday's article, study author Dr. Jan Willem Gorter said he and his co-authors were not specifically referring to \"the surveillance that is happening in doctors' offices\" at 18 and 24 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were recommending against a population-wide screening program that would require screening every child at a certain age level for autism, he said. Nobody is conducting such a study at this time in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from a South Korean study of that nature published last month in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggested 1 in 38 children had autism -- a much higher number than previously believed. Some experts questioned the accuracy of those  results, which were based on screening of 55,000 12-year-old children in South Korea, suggesting that the screening may have picked up other developmental delays, not just autism.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the CDC told CNN it was considering a total population study of autism, but no such study is currently underway.\n\n\n\n\n\nGorter said he and his colleagues did not include the South Korean study in their analysis, but he said it showed \"exactly why we wrote the paper.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he and his co-authors based their suggestions on what they learned from children with cerebral palsy, and that his ultimate goal is to \"find the children who truly have autism and find ways to help them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nScreening isn't the only issue touched on in Monday's paper.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article also finds \"little support for the effectiveness for speech and language therapy for people with autism,\" argues that \"applied behavior intervention did not significantly improve the cognitive outcomes of children\" and says that \"screening is pointless, and almost certainly unethical.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan Martin, director of media relations for the American Academy of Pediatrics, pointed to the academic journal's disclaimer, which says statements and opinions in the articles it publishes \"are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the AAP.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut several autism specialists said they feared the theoretical questions the article poses would turn back the clock to a time when parents' concerns about their childrens' development weren't heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCowan said Monday's report completely leaves out studies that have shown benefits for children in cognitive and social developments. He cites a study published by Dawson and Sally Rogers, which found giving toddlers as young as 18 months old intensive therapy by trained specialists and their parents, can effectively improve the child's IQ, social interaction and ability to communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nCowan called that study a \"landmark (clinical) trial\" and said he was surprised the Canadian researchers did not include it.\n\n\n\n\n\nManning-Courtney, who is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the study could be misinterpreted by some, \"especially insurance companies,\" which may decide they don't have to pay for costly, lengthy autism therapies if a study says that \"efficacious treatments are lacking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Gorter said the study's authors want to \"help improve the outcome for the children's lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would hope our debate would lead to an action,\" he said.",

  "context": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- A Japanese food corporation has recalled five products after determining they contained the chemical melamine that has been blamed for the deaths of four children and sickening thousands of others.\n\n\n\nOfficials stresses though that there were no reports of anyone becoming ill from consuming the sweets, which were made with ingredients imported from China, according to a representative of Tokyo's Marudai Food. The recall was issued several days ago.\n\n\n\nTests found a ratio of 37 milligrams of melamine per kilogram of the products, the company said Friday.\n\n\n\nJapan is the latest country to report products tainted with melamine after thousands of Chinese children fell ill. The illnesses were traced to infant formula to which the toxic chemical had been added in Chinese dairy plants.\n\n\n\nNearly 53,000 children in China have been sickened by the formula or other products containing melamine. Four babies have died, and five Hong Kong children have suffered melamine-related illnesses. Dozens of countries have banned or recalled Chinese milk products.  Watch how the scandal has spread beyond milk \u00bb\n\n\n\nHong Kong officials said Friday that a type of Heinz cereal and wasabi crackers were recalled after they were found to contain excessive melamine. Test results for another 40 samples of baby food are pending, said Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety.\n\n\n\nEarlier Friday, the maker of a widely distributed Chinese candy linked to the melamine scandal said it would stop selling the confection in China. The manufacturer, Guanshengyan, had already recalled exports of White Rabbit Creamy Candies, and food-safety authorities worldwide have pulled them from shelves.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the European Union joined authorities worldwide in banning the import of Chinese milk products for children.\n\n\n\nChinese authorities have arrested 18 people in a nationwide investigation. They include two brothers who face charges of selling contaminated milk; the brothers could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper.  Watch Chinese government reaction \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down, and the chemical melamine was added so it would pass quality checks, the newspaper said. Adding melamine makes a product seem to have a higher protein level.\n\n\n\nMelamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. It is the same industrial contaminant that was found last year in pet food produced in China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats.  Watch the fallout from the scandal \u00bb\n\n\n\nHealth experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime.\n\nThe portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the \"only\" portrait painted during his lifetime.\n\nThe image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.\n\nWells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old.\n\n\"A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,\" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.",

  "context": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Mike Mette has been a Chicago police officer for almost four years. But now, as a result of a fistfight one night in Dubuque, Iowa, he is a convicted felon.\n\n\n\nMike Mette, a Chicago police officer, says he acted in self-defense when he punched Jake Gotthard, a student at the University of Dubuque.\n\n\n\nMette has been sentenced to almost five years in prison after Dubuque County Judge Monica Ackley found him guilty of assault causing serious injury. Mette says he's been wronged.\n\n\n\n\"I was arrested for self-defense ... I was defending myself,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMette's saga started in October 2005 after a night of drinking in Dubuque, where he was visiting his brother Mark. After the bars closed, Mette and his crew made their way to an after-hours party thrown by Jake Gotthard, a student at the University of Dubuque.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, Mette and his friends entered the house party, but decided to leave without paying the required $5 entry fee when they saw the room was mostly empty. Gotthard became angry, and with the help of his roommate, began chasing Mette down the street. Gotthard claims someone in Mette's group had stolen his cell phone and he wanted it back. Exactly what happened to the cell phone is still unclear.\n\n\n\nThe altercation continued a block and a half down the street and eventually ended up in front of the house of Mette's brother.  Fight could land cop in prison \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"That's when Mr. Gotthard hit me. He hit me with two fists like this, straight into the chest,\" Mette said. \"He was yelling about his cell phone, telling me if he didn't get his cell phone back he was going to beat the crap out of me. He hit me several more times and then I pushed him away from me. It wasn't until after the third time is when he came back at me again and that is when I struck him.\"\n\n\n\nWhen police arrived, they found Gotthard lying on the ground with bruises and lacerations on his face, cheek, nose, chin and forehead. Mette, who had blood on his shirt and whose knuckle was bruised and cut, was arrested and charged with a felony.\n\n\n\n\"[Gotthard] had bruises on the side of his neck, his arms, his elbow, his shoulders, on his back, that were simply not consistent with Mr. Mette's version that he only struck him once,\" said Assistant County Attorney Tim Gallagher.\n\n\n\nDubuque doctors testified the injuries were consistent with someone who had been stomped and kicked. But a doctor testifying for Mette's defense rejected the Dubuque findings. He said all those injuries could have come from Mette's single punch and the impact from falling on the sidewalk.\n\n\n\nGallagher said the decision to prosecute Mette was a tough one.\n\n\n\n\"It's never an easy situation when someone is sentenced to prison, particularly when it's a police officer that we have to rely on,\" he said. \"But we can't allow individuals to be given certain privileges because of their occupation.\"\n\n\n\nThe case spawned a battle between newspaper columnists in Chicago and Dubuque.\n\n\n\n\"Mette played baseball in college. But what's happening to him isn't about Iowa baseball mythology. It doesn't smell of corn. It stinks of the pig barn,\" wrote Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass. He chalks the judge's decision up to small town politics.\n\n\n\nIn a reply, a columnist for the Dubuque Telegraph Herald wrote that Kass is a \"legendary muckraker\" who is \"training his scorn\" on Ackley, the judge.\n\n\n\nMette is currently on unpaid leave from the Chicago Police Department and is appealing his case. He will begin serving his five-year sentence in November. E-mail to a friend",

Tropical Storm Malou is forecast to arrive in the region Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary officials said the exercise could have gone ahead despite the weather, but safety concerns prompted the postponement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although the alliance is capable of operating in all weather conditions, this decision was made in the interest of safety for the participants,\" the U.S. military said in its statement. \"Both high winds and heavy seas would have directly impacted the exercise area and the training objectives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exercises will be rescheduled but a new date has not been set, the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. officials have said the naval exercises off the western coast of the Korean peninsula are in response to North Korea's alleged sinking of a South Korean warship last March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We said that we would continue a series of exercises that are defensive in nature, that are designed to send a clear message to North Korea,\" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said in August.\n\n\n\n\n\nTensions between North Korea and South Korea, as well as between North Korea and the U.S., have escalated since a May report from Seoul, South Korea, blamed the North for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report, whose findings have been endorsed by the U.S., alleged that a North Korean sub sank the Cheonan warship with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea denies it sunk the ship and has sharply criticized the military exercises, describing them as war games conducted under a false pretext.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,\" the state-run KCNA news agency said in July. \"It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[This] double-dealing attitude is a dangerous one of driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a war phase,\" KCNA said.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Plans to rejuvenate a dilapidated London icon -- known worldwide to movie and music fans  -- were unveiled last week.\n\n\n\nThe redevelopment of Battersea Power Station includes a new eco-dome and a solar chimney.\n\n\n\nBattersea Power Station, which has dominated the west London skyline since 1933, will -- subject to planning approval -- undergo an $8 billion redevelopment including shops, homes, a hotel, offices and a striking 300 meter eco-tower.  The building appeared on the cover of the 1977 Pink Floyd album \"Animals,\" complete with a giant pig floating above its four distinctive towers.\n\n\n\nIt has also appeared in numerous movies including sci-fi drama \"The Children of Men\", new Batman feature \"The Dark Knight\" and Alfred Hitchcock's \"Sabotage.\"\n\n\n\nReal Estate Opportunities Ltd (REO), who currently own the 38 acre site say the defunct and crumbling edifice will be: \"brought back to life in the most spectacular way. It will be a place to live, work and play\".\n\n\n\nAn Irish development company, REO is planning to spend $300 million repairing the old coal-powered station and get it working again -- this time producing energy from biofuels, waste and other renewable energy sources.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the regeneration stands a vast new chimney and eco-dome, which as well as housing apartments and offices will act as a vast solar ventilation system cutting down the building's energy demand by two thirds.\n\n\n\nManaging Director of REO's development manager, Treasury Holdings UK, Rob Tincknell describes it as \"a power station for the 21st century...supporting a truly sustainable, zero carbon development\".\n\n\n\nUruguayan architect Rafael Vinoly whose daunting job it was to come up with a workable new design for the much loved site describes the old power station as a \"remarkable architectural presence\". In creating a vast transparent chimney Vinoly hopes that it will contrast with what he describes as the \"monumental mass\" of J. Theo Halliday and Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's original design.\n\n\n\nOf course, we've been here before. Since the turbines were shut down for the final time in 1983 the power station -- situated on the south bank of the river Thames -- has been the subject of several failed redevelopment ventures.\n\n\n\nIn 1983, a scheme proposed by UK businessman John Broome promised to turn the power station into a gigantic theme park. But by the decade's close and despite the enthusiastic backing of UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher his funding package for redevelopment, much like the site itself, were in a ruinous state.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, development company Parkview International headed up by Victor Hwang acquired the freehold for the site. By the time its current owners REO bought the site a decade later another over ambitious redevelopment scheme -- which included a single table restaurant atop one of the four chimneys -- had come and gone. By now the entire site was in a pretty parlous state -- the chimneys being declared beyond repair and threatened with imminent demolition.\n\n\n\nThis new proposal has already provoked a chorus of dissent. Writing in London's Evening Standard newspaper, architecture critic Rowan Moore described the idea as: \"spectacularly, riotously, extravagantly nuts,\" telling the developers and planners to: \"Forget it. Do not try to compromise with a tower two-thirds as high. Do not build a tower. Aim for zero-carbon and beautiful buildings...\".\n\n\n\nThe Guardian's resident architecture expert Jonathan Glancey gave the designs a cool reception describing them as; \"more than a little over the top\".\n\n\n\nCNN spoke to Keith Garner, an architect and member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group about the new proposals. He didn't mince his words. \"If you take it as a serious proposal, it's immensely harmful,\" he said. \"It is a massive tower -- about the same size as the gherkin. Battersea Power Station is a Grade II* listed building. If you put a tower of that mass next to it, you are going to diminish its significance.\n\n\n\n\"If you are serious about rescuing this building you would do it in stages. The old turbine halls and the switch houses are easily reusable. A sensible, rational approach to this would involve starting with the power station itself and doing the work in small achievable phases.\"\n\n\n\nConsequently, Garner doesn't believe that the new plans are credible.\n\n\n\n\"I think the developers have overplayed it. This is a joke and I think it needs to be denounced for what it is -- a ludicrous and unnecessary diversion from the principal task of repairing the building.\"\n\n\n\nTake a look at the photos of the new proposal and classic images on the tab at the top of the page.

We will have to work hand in hand.\n\n\"I think we are the only two nations which are powerful enough to solve those very critical, vital issue,\" Aso said.\n\nJapan's Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said that being the first to visit the Obama White House was an indication of the priority the new president placed on the relationship.\n\nAnother topic likely to have been on the agenda was Japan's Asian neighbor North Korea, which U.S. intelligence says is preparing to test a long-range missile. Pyongyang has denied the charge, instead saying it is making preparations to launch a satellite.\n\nA test-fire by North Korea in 2006 failed 40 seconds after launch. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii.\n\nAso's visit to Washington comes, as his approval rating stands at a meager 11 percent, the second lowest ever recorded for a Japanese prime minister. Yoshiro Mori, a former prime minister, resigned after his rate bottomed out at 9 percent.\n\nLast week his finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa announced he will step down after coming under fire for appearing intoxicated at a weekend news conference during the G-7 meeting in Rome.\n\nCNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The autopsy on Corey Haim revealed the actor's heart was enlarged and his lungs were filled with water when he died, Haim's manager said.\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles County coroner told Haim's mother that her son suffered from pulmonary congestion, manager Mark Heaslip said.\n\n\n\nHeaslip said this was evidence that Haim's death was not caused by a drug overdose, but Brian Elias with the coroner's office said they are waiting for toxicology tests before deciding what killed Haim.\n\n\n\nThe 1980s teen movie actor, who struggled for decades with drug addiction, died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother, authorities said.\n\n\n\nLongtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman asked Wednesday that people not \"jump the gun\" to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim.\n\n\n\nHeaslip, manager to both Feldman and Haim, said he seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death.\n\n\n\nHaim, 38, was taken to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, early Wednesday, where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. PT (5:15 a.m. ET), said Ed Winter, Los Angeles County deputy coroner.\n\n\n\nHaim was in the apartment he shared with his mother, Judy Haim, when he \"became a little dizzy, he kind of went to his knees in the bedroom,\" Winter said. \"His mom assisted him in the bed. He became unresponsive.\"\n\n\n\nHis mother called paramedics to the apartment, which is between Hollywood Hills and Burbank, he said.\n\n\n\nHaim had suffered from flulike symptoms for two days, the deputy coroner said.\n\n\n\n\"We found no illicit drugs. However, we did recover four of his prescription meds at the location,\" Winter said, adding he does not know what those drugs were.\n\n\n\nHaim was \"weaned down to literally zero medications\" in the past two weeks by an addiction specialist, Heaslip said on HLN's \"Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell\" on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe doctor \"put him on a new line of medications,\" Feldman said on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nFeldman pleaded with people not to draw conclusions that Haim died from a drug overdose. He said that until the autopsy report is issued, \"nobody knows and nobody's going to know.\"\n\n\n\nWatch Corey Feldman talk about his friend's death on \"Larry King Live\"\n\n\n\n\"I know that there were symptoms that he was showing that expressed it could be a number of things,\" Feldman said. \"This could have been a kidney failure. This could have been a heart failure.\"\n\n\n\nHeaslip that said Haim's mother, Judy, told him \"there were no signs of him overdosing.\"\n\n\n\nHis death came as his career was picking up, with Haim booking \"movie after movie,\" Heaslip said. His latest film is set for release soon, he said.\n\n\n\nHaim \"really became a man\" in recent months as he helped his mother in her battle with cancer, Feldman said. \"He's been there for her, taking care of her, being responsible,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFeldman said he was angry about how Haim has been snubbed in recent years by the entertainment industry. He was broke, without a car and living in a month-to-month rental apartment with his mother, he said.\n\n\n\n\"We build people up as children, we put them on pedestals and then when we decide that they are not marketable anymore, we walk away from them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHaim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie \"The Lost Boys,\" in which he appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire.\n\n\n\nIn later years, the two friends -- who appeared in eight movies together -- struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways. They reunited for a reality show, \"The Two Coreys,\" in 2007, but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year.\n\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" Haim and Feldman discussed their battle with drugs. Feldman told King that he had gotten clean, but it took Haim longer.\n\n\n\nHaim called himself \"a chronic relapser for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything,\" he said. \"I mean, I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes, which is why I have a support group around me consistently.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Feldman told People magazine that he would no longer speak to Haim until his former co-star got sober. In a clip from \"The Two Coreys,\" Feldman and his wife, along with two other former teen stars, called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help, the magazine said.\n\n\n\nThe meeting followed an incident in which Haim, scheduled to film a cameo appearance in a direct-to-DVD sequel to \"The Lost Boys,\" appeared on the set \"clearly under the influence,\" People reported.\n\n\n\nFeldman told King on Wednesday that he renewed his contact with Haim in the past year because of the progress he made against his addiction.\n\n\n\nHaim was born December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, according to a biography on his Web site. He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series \"The Edison Twins.\" His first film role was in the 1984 movie \"First Born.\"\n\n\n\nHaim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film \"Lucas.\" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, \"If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing \"The Lost Boys,\" Haim and Feldman appeared in \"License to Drive\" and \"Dream a Little Dream.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Actor and author Hill Harper wants you to live your life and understand what true wealth is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The word courage, one of my favorite words, the root or the etymology of that word is 'cour,' which means heart,\" he said. \"I think true courage is actually following your heart and not getting or succumbing to what other people's definition of what your life should be. Live your life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper, who once wanted to be a professional football player, tells me the story of how he accomplished that himself, thanks to the advice of an uncle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had all this student loan debt, and I had this six-figure legal job offer in corporate law coming out of Harvard Law School. There were job opportunities there, particularly out of this high-end law firm,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper has a bachelor of arts degree from Brown University, where he studied acting, and a masters in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government, which is a part of Harvard.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says many people told him to take the legal job offer to pay off his debt. They advised him to pursue his passion of acting later. His Uncle Frank recognized he was only looking at the legal job for the salary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"'Let me tell you, if you're ever making a decision and the principle reason you'll do it is because of money, then it is absolutely the incorrect decision,'\" Harper said his uncle advised. Harper emphasizes that money can be a factor, but it should not be the primary one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went on to take a job waiting tables from 11 at night to 7 in the morning at a diner. Fighting rush hour traffic to get home by 8 to go to sleep. Wake up at noon or 1 to audition for films and go to acting class in the evening and maybe come home and get a nap between 9:30 and 10 and go to work again at 11,\" he said. \"I certainly wasn't making as much money as I would have at a law firm, but I was following my heart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown for his roles in \"CSI: NY \" and \"Beloved,\" Spike Lee gave Harper his first big acting break when he hired him to play one of the leads of his movie \"Get on the Bus.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper has written three books that have been on The New York Times best-seller list. His first one, \"Letters to a Young Brother: MANifest Your Destiny,\" won the American Library Association Award for Best Books for Young Adults in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know it was funny, just a few years before, I was in grad school at Harvard, and Spike was teaching a theater class or film classes at Harvard,\" he said with a laugh. \"I went down there and I was an extra in his film 'Malcolm X.' I stood in this big huge line and auditioned to become an extra.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper's definition of wealth changed while he was filming \"For Colored Girls\" in Atlanta and writing a book about money and finance to encourage people to stop using a lack of money as an excuse to defer their dreams.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper has also had his brushes with harsh realities in life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So one day, I wake up in my hotel room and I can't swallow. I knew I wasn't sick. I didn't have a fever. Something inside me told me that something was wrong,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe describes undergoing tests that involve enduring 16 needles in his neck. Yet, he managed to have fun by posing for pictures with the nurses and doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he returned a week later for his pathology, no one was laughing and joking. He says he knew then he had thyroid cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I realized very clearly through that journey was that it doesn't matter how much celebrity you have or how much money you have or how well you've saved or if your 401(k) is solid, if you don't have your health, and if you don't have your loved ones and relationships with your family, then none of it means anything,\" he said. \"Money is important. It is an important resource to have to help us build the life we want, but we overvalue it. There are so many other wealth factors in our lives. If we identify them as such, we can actually identify what true wealth is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis inspired the title of his latest book, \"The Wealth Cure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was seeking a health cure, but, at the same time, I realized I was getting a wealth cure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper said he is feeling fine now and continues to check in with his doctors. He would like a role on a show like \"Mad Men.\"",

  "context": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- George Obama, the half brother of U.S. President Barack Obama, told CNN on Sunday that he was released from a Kenyan jail hours after his arrest on suspicion of marijuana possession.\n\nGeorge Obama was arrested in Kenya on suspicion of marijuana possession, according to police.\n\nKenyan police did not confirm whether George Obama was still in their custody. Obama spoke to CNN from his cell phone, and a relative also said he was released.\n\nHe said he was arrested on Saturday and released later that day.\n\nObama was arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis, known in Kenya as bhang, and resisting arrest, Inspector Augustine Mutembei said. He was held at Huruma police post in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and scheduled to appear in court Monday, Mutembei said.\n\nBut Obama told CNN all charges against him were dropped. Police would not comment on that.\n\nSpeaking from behind bars on Saturday, Obama denied the allegations.\n\n\"They took me from my home,\" he said. \"I don't know why they are charging me.\"\n\nGeorge Obama and the president barely know each other, though they have met. George Obama was one of the few people closely related to the president who did not attend the inauguration in Washington.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Dreams from My Father,\" Barack Obama describes meeting George as a \"painful affair.\" His trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known.\n\nCNN tracked down George Obama in August 2008 and found him at a small house in Huruma, a Nairobi slum, where he lives with his mother's extended family. His birth certificate shows he is Barack Obama's half brother.\n\nThe two men share the same Kenyan father.\n\nIn the memoir, Barack Obama struggles to reconcile with his father after he left him and his mother when he was a child.\n\nBarack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was 6 months old. And like his half brother, George hardly knew his father.\n\nGeorge was his father's last child and had not been aware of his famous half brother until he rose to prominence in the Democratic primaries last year.\n\nUnlike his grandmother in Kogela, in western Kenya, George Obama received little attention from the media until reports about him surfaced in August 2008.\n\nThe reports sprung from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama lived in a shack and was \"earning less than a dollar a day.\"\n\nThe reports left George Obama angry.\n\n\"I was brought up well. I live well even now,\" he said. \"The magazines, they have exaggerated everything.\n\n\"I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges,\" Obama said.\n\nObama, who is in his mid-20s, said at the time that he was learning to become a mechanic and was active in youth groups in Huruma. He said he tries to help the community as much as he can.",

If you'd rather not know about the plot, stop reading now.\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Winslet and David Cross star in \"The Reader,\" which has received criticism from some quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- One major contender's chances at Oscar gold may be damaged due to its sensitive subject matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Reader,\" which is up for five Oscars -- including best actress (for star Kate Winslet) and best picture -- is being slammed by \"Explaining Hitler\" author Ron Rosenbaum, who's asked Academy members to shun the post-World War II drama because the film \"asks us to empathize with an unrepentant mass murderer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenbaum, who wrote his commentary for Slate.com, said that's not his only reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It gives the impression that ordinary German people only learned the terrible things that happened in the death camps in the East after the war,\" he said in an interview with CNN. \"In fact, ordinary German people participated in Hitler's final solution, the extermination of the Jews -- it was no secret.\" Read Rosenbaum's essay\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the German book with the same title, \"The Reader\" stars Winslet as Hanna Schmitz, a former Nazi prison guard living in postwar Germany. She meets and has a secretive affair with teenager Michael Berg (David Cross), who often reads aloud to her at her request. Unbeknownst to Michael, Hanna is illiterate.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir affair ends abruptly when she mysteriously disappears.\n\n\n\n\n\nEight years later, Michael is a law student. One day, while observing Nazi war criminals on trial, he's shocked to find Hanna as a defendant in the courtroom. The court finds her guilty of killing 300 Jewish women during the war and sentences her to life in prison. While behind bars, Michael sends her books on tape, which, over time, help Hanna finally learn to read.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherein lies the problem for Rosenbaum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What essentially it did,\" said Rosenbaum, \"was celebrate the enrichment of a life of a mass murderer when she learned how to read. ... Imagine if there were a film about Charles Manson learning how to play chess and what a better guy it made him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, others in the Jewish community are applauding the film, including Ken Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Jacobson says \"The Reader\" opens itself up to criticism, but is worthy of an Oscar at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it conveys a series of messages that actually are very powerful about the Holocaust, and it's not in the usual way,\" Jacobson told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As time goes on, as we have Holocaust deniers emerging more and more, we need people to be able to relate personally to what happened,\" said Jacobson. \"I think this film does this in a very powerful way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Weinstein Company, the studio behind \"The Reader,\" says it is proud of the film. \"It is sad that some people misinterpreted the film's message,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not about the Holocaust,\" the company added, \"it is about what Germany did to itself and its future generations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Rosenbaum's piece, and the backlash he touched off, affect \"The Reader's\" Oscar chances Sunday? Entertainment reporter Tom O'Neil, who follows awards shows for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com, doesn't think so. Given \"The Reader's\" five nominations, he believes Hollywood has already embraced the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oscar has taken special notice of 'The Reader' because it's not just your average Holocaust movie,\" said O'Neil. \"It doesn't beg for forgiveness when dealing with Nazis. It makes you think.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Rosenbaum says any further accolades for the drama would be unfortunate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would be very disappointed in the intelligence level of Hollywood if it gave the best picture award to 'The Reader,' \" he said.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- In their first head-to-head debate, Sen. John McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama as a candidate who \"doesn't understand\" the key issues the country faces, and Obama linked McCain to President Bush on several issues.\n\n\n\n\"I'm afraid Sen. Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy,\" McCain said Friday as the two traded jabs over Iraq.\n\n\n\nObama shot back, \"I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.\"\n\n\n\nMcCain drew from his experience overseas as he tried to portray himself as the more qualified candidate.\n\n\n\n\"Incredibly, incredibly Sen. Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with Gen. [David] Petraeus,\" he said.  Watch McCain, Obama talk about fighting in Iraq \u00bb\n\n\n\nMcCain slammed Obama for not supporting the surge, an increase of about 30,000 troops to Iraq in early 2007. Bush sent the additional troops as part of a campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces.\n\n\n\n\"John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007,\" Obama shot back. \"You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.\" Watch entire debate:  Part 1 \u00bb |  Part 2 \u00bb |  Part 3 \u00bb\n\n\n\nObama repeatedly criticized the Bush administration and charged that McCain is an endorser of his policies.  See scenes from the debate \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn describing his tax plan, Obama said, \"over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.\"\n\n\n\nObama also said the economic crisis is the \"final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Sen. McCain.\"\n\n\n\nBoth candidates squeezed in a few cheap shots. Obama brought up McCain's jokingly singing a line about bombing Iran, and McCain jabbed Obama for his short-lived \"presidential seal.\"\n\n\n\nImmediately after the debate, both campaigns issued statements declaring their candidate the winner. Grade the candidates' performance in the debate\n\n\n\n\"This was a clear victory for Barack Obama on John McCain's home turf. Sen. McCain offered nothing but more of the same failed Bush policies, and Barack Obama made a forceful case for change in our economy and our foreign policy,\" said Obama-Biden campaign manager David Plouffe.\n\n\n\n\"John McCain needed a game-changer tonight, and by any measure, he didn't get it,\" he said. iReport.com: Who do you think won the debate?\n\n\n\nMcCain's campaign said \"there was one man who was presidential tonight; that man was John McCain.\"\n\n\n\n\"There was another who was political; that was Barack Obama. John McCain won this debate and controlled the dialogue throughout, whether it was the economy, taxes, spending, Iraq or Iran. There was a leadership gap, a judgment gap and a boldness gap on display tonight, a fact Barack Obama acknowledged when he said John McCain was right at least five times,\" communications director Jill Hazelbaker said. Full coverage of the debates\n\n\n\nDuring the first 30 minutes of the debate, the candidates focused on the economy, even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy.\n\n\n\nFor a while, it seemed like the debate might not even take place, because McCain said he would not show up unless Congress came to an agreement on the government's proposed $700 billion bailout plan.\n\n\n\nMcCain said Friday that enough progress has been made for him to attend the debate, even though Congress has not made a deal.\n\n\n\nHere's a snapshot of what the candidates said.\n\n\n\nOn government spending:\n\n\n\nMcCain said he would consider a spending freeze on everything but defense, veterans affairs and entitlement programs in order to cut back on government spending.\n\n\n\nObama disagreed, saying, \"The problem is, you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.\n\n\n\n\"There are some programs that are very important that are currently underfunded,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe agreed that the government needs to cut spending in some areas, but he said other areas, such as early childhood education, need more funding.\n\n\n\nMcCain repeated his call to veto every bill with earmarks.  Watch the candidates spar over earmarks \u00bb\n\n\n\nObama said the country \"absolutely\" needs earmark reform but said, \"the fact is, eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we are going to get the middle class back on track.\"\n\n\n\nOn the bailout proposal:\n\n\n\nObama said that the United States was facing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\n\n\nMcCain said he was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were working together to solve the crisis.\n\n\n\nObama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $700 billion plan proposed by President Bush's top economic advisers, saying the final details of the proposal were not known.\n\n\n\nMcCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it.\n\n\n\nOn the likelihood of another terrorist attack:\n\n\n\nMcCain that another attack on the scale of the September 11 hijackings is \"much less likely\" now than it was the day after the terrorist attacks.\n\n\n\n\"America is safer now than it was on 9/11,\" he said, \"But we have a long way to go before we can declare America safe.\"\n\n\n\nObama agreed that the United States is \"safer in some ways\" but said the country needed to focus more on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and restoring America's image in the world.\n\n\n\nOn relations with Russia:\n\n\n\nObama called for a re-evaluation of the United States' approach to Russia in light of the country's recent military action in the Caucasus.\n\n\n\n\"You cannot be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMcCain accused Obama of responding naively to Russia's invasion of neighboring Georgia last month by calling on both sides to exercise restraint.\n\n\n\nMcCain said he would support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in NATO.\n\n\n\nOn Iran:\n\n\n\nMcCain said Iranian nuclear weapons would be an \"existential threat to the state of Israel\" and would encourage other countries in the Middle East to seek nuclear weapons as well.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot allow another Holocaust,\" he said.\n\n\n\nObama agreed that the United States \"cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran,\" calling for tougher sanctions from a range of countries including Russia and China.\n\n\n\nMcCain called for a new \"league of democracies\" to stand firm against Iran.\n\n\n\nOn Iraq:\n\n\n\nMcCain said the next president will have to decide when and how to leave Iraq and what the United States will leave behind.\n\n\n\nThe Republican candidate said that the war had been badly managed at the beginning but that the United States was now winning, thanks to a \"great general and a strategy that succeeded.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sen. Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq,\" McCain said.\n\n\n\nObama responded, \"that's not true; that's not true.\"\n\n\n\nHe blasted McCain as having been wrong about the war at the start, saying McCain had failed to anticipate the uprising against U.S. forces and violence between rival religious groups in the country.  Watch Obama tell McCain he was 'wrong' \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"At the time when the war started, you said it was quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were,\" Obama said, citing the key White House policy justifying the 2003 invasion.\n\n\n\n\"You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong,\" he said.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A leading UK hospital has defended its practice of using organs donated by smokers after the death of a soldier who received the cancerous lungs of a heavy smoker.\n\n\n\nA close up X-ray view of a cigarette smoker's lungs.\n\n\n\nCorporal Matthew Millington, 31, died at his home in 2008, less than a year after receiving a transplant that was supposed to save his life at Papworth Hospital -- the UK's largest specialist cardiothoracic hospital, in Cambridgeshire, east England.\n\n\n\nPapworth Hospital released a statement saying using donor lungs from smokers was not \"unusual.\"\n\n\n\nThe statement added that the hospital had no option but to use lungs from smokers as \"the number of lung transplants carried out would have been significantly lower,\" if they didn't.\n\n\n\nShould hospitals use smokers' lungs in transplants?\n\n\n\nAn inquest held last week heard that Millington, who served in the Queen's Royal Lancers, was serving in Iraq in 2005 when he was diagnosed with an incurable condition that left him unable to breathe.\n\n\n\nHe was told he required a transplant and in April 2007 received a double lung transplant at Papworth Hospital.\n\n\n\nLess than a year later, doctors discovered a tumor in the new lungs. Despite radiotherapy, Millington died on February 8, 2008, at his family home near Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire.\n\n\n\nThe inquest found a radiologist failed to highlight the growth of a cancerous tumor on the donor lungs.\n\n\n\nTests found that he had received the lungs of a donor who smoked up to 50 cigarettes a day, the inquest at North Staffordshire coroner's court heard.\n\n\n\nThe hospital said in the statement: \"This is an extremely rare case. Papworth Hospital has a very strong track record of high quality outcomes and this is an extremely rare case.\n\n\n\n\"Patients who are accepted on to the transplant waiting list have no other option open to them, however, we must stress that all donor organs are screened rigorously prior to transplantation.\n\n\n\n\"Using lungs from donors who have smoked in the past is not unusual. During 2008/09 146 lung transplants were carried out in the UK.\n\n\n\n\"During the same period 84 people died on the waiting list. If we had a policy that said we did not use the lungs of those who had smoked, then the number of lung transplants carried out would have been significantly lower.\"\n\n\n\nThe tumor's growth was accelerated by the immuno-suppressive drugs Millington was taking to prevent his body rejecting the transplanted lungs, the inquest heard.\n\n\n\nNorth Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith recorded that Millington, had died of \"complications of transplant surgery and immuno-suppressive drug treatment.\"",

And with such a hectic schedule, she has picked up a few tips on how to stay sane while traveling.\n\n\n\n\"The most important tip I could offer anybody who does a lot of traveling is to stay as organized as possible,\" Stam says. To keep from losing items on the road, Stam keeps everything in the same place in her suitcase, including her crown. \"It's really funny, but it helps me kind of keep a clear mind,\" she explains.\n\n\n\nShe also unpacks a little as soon as she arrives in her hotel room. \"You realize when you get on the road, and that's your life, your hotel becomes your home,\" Stam says. \"And so you really need to feel that you're coming home to your room, to your place where all of your things are.\"\n\n\n\nStam also stresses the importance of a good night's sleep. \"It's absolutely essential to get a full night's rest or at least quality rest,\" she says. However she also acknowledges the difficulties of sleeping a full eight hours while traveling.\n\n\n\nBut the ever chipper Miss America has a trick for getting around the wonky work hours: \"If you know you only have 10 minutes, you take a quick 10 minute nap.\"\n\n\n\nWith airplanes being her primary mode of transportation, the beauty queen also has advice for the frequent flyer on how to stay fresh while on the go. \"It's tricky,\" she says. \"A lot of people lose their luggage and stuff. So I always keep my makeup with me, put on a little powder before I go somewhere.\"\n\n\n\nAnd when you're Miss America, somewhere could be anywhere.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Comedy is hard; dying is easy. Any stand-up will tell you that.\n\n\n\nAdam Sandler and Seth Rogen play comedians in \"Funny People.\"\n\n\n\nLet's have a hand, then, for Judd Apatow. Hollywood's most successful contemporary comedy producer isn't resting on his laurels but continues to push toward risky subject matter: male sexual insecurity in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" unwanted pregnancy in \"Knocked Up\" -- and now the big C.\n\n\n\nNo, not cancer -- though Adam Sandler's superstar comedian George Simmons is stricken with an appropriately eccentric form of leukemia. No, this latest film's true subject is Celebrity and the funny things it does to people.\n\n\n\nApatow's most personal (and also most self-indulgent) film, \"Funny People,\" shuffles between three competitive Angelino roommates scrambling to grasp a rung on the showbiz ladder (Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Jason Schwartzman), Simmons' multimillion-dollar Malibu mansion and the L.A. comedy clubs that sometimes bridge the gap between anonymity and fame.\n\n\n\nApatow and Sandler know these worlds well enough. The movie begins, in fact, with old home video footage of young Adam goofing off, making prank phone calls while his roommate Judd sniggers behind the camera. It's one of the few times we see Sandler really having fun and cutting loose. This is mostly a restrained, subdued and admirably unsentimental performance.\n\n\n\nIt feels natural that Simmons -- faced with his dire prognosis -- should return to the comedy circuit to wrestle with his imminent extinction before a roomful of strangers, even as he decides to keep his condition a secret from everyone around him.\n\n\n\nIt's actually not so hard in his case because he doesn't have any real friends, only \"showbiz friends.\"\n\n\n\nThe exception is Ira Wright (Rogen), a struggling young comic who lucks into a job as his hero's joke writer slash personal assistant. Simmons is by turns demanding, generous, friendly and abusive, and Ira couldn't be happier.\n\n\n\nThe cross-currents are intriguing: He's getting his first taste of the high life, just as George is trying to savor his last days by reliving his first steps on the circuit.\n\n\n\nTrue to form, Apatow negotiates the perilous terrain of existential doubt with his fall-back weapon of choice, the penis joke. Some of these are choice (Ira's real last name is \"Wiener,\" pronounced \"Whiner\"), but many, many more feel flabby and redundant.\n\n\n\nThere's even an Andy Dick joke, in the form of Andy Dick himself -- one of several celebrity cameos, the oddest of which is surely Eminem, wondering aloud if George wouldn't be better off dead.\n\n\n\nWe must be approaching the 80-minute mark by then, about the time many comedies start wrapping things up. But it's a question that doesn't seem to have occurred to Simmons or the filmmakers before, and it spurs Apatow on to develop another hour of additional material in which George, miraculously recovered, pursues the love of his life (Leslie Mann), Ira in tow, without much consideration for her two daughters or her husband (Eric Bana). It's as if the movie bred its own sequel.\n\n\n\nThere's plenty of funny stuff here. Bana has a ball as the obtuse Aussie, but despite all the blue jokes, this is a more modulated, pensive effort than Apatow's previous hits.\n\n\n\nHe's improved, a little, as a director (perhaps the credit belongs to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who ensures that for once it doesn't all look like a sitcom), but Apatow is still in dire need of a good editor.\n\n\n\nHis instincts are generous. He wants to give us the six-course meal, and to go around the table, give everybody the chance to tell us a funny story. As a result \"Funny People\" is consistently entertaining but also rather grueling -- as if we're watching two or three different movies at the same time. At least one of these -- the tribulations of the young roomies -- we've seen before, and amusing as these guys are, they properly belong in the deleted scenes category.\n\n\n\nBut Apatow isn't one to kill his babies, that's for sure. He's more likely to write them an additional scene or three. (Mann is Mrs. Apatow, and their two daughters also figure large.)\n\n\n\nStill, if you're not averse to too much of a good-ish thing, and can stomach another of those terminal Hollywood illnesses that leaves the patient with no discernible ill-effects, \"Funny People\" is a fairly shrewd and nonjudgmental dissection of how celebrity skews and contaminates even the most intimate relationships.\n\n\n\nThe rich and famous aren't the only narcissists in this game, it seems. We're all a bit funny that way.\n\n\n\n\"Funny People\" is rated R and runs 146 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo lifted martial law in the country's south, which she declared after the massacre of 57 people last month, Philippine news outlets reported Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order lifting martial law was due to be effective at 9 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) Saturday, the Philippines News Agency (PNA) and CNN affiliate ABS-CBN said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary troops will remain in Maguindanao province to keep the peace despite the move, said Victor Ibrado, chief of staff of the Philippine armed forces, PNA said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArroyo imposed martial law December 4 but lifted it Saturday after deciding it had achieved its objectives, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said, according to PNA.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal government was now back in power and the justice system was functioning again, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have said the November 23 massacre in Maguindanao province was a politically motivated attempt to keep an opponent of the politically powerful Ampatuan family from running for governor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty journalists were among those killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe martial law allowed arrests without warrants, and at least six members of the Ampatuan family -- including a local mayor -- were arrested, according to ABS-CBN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities raided a warehouse and ranch belonging to the family last weekend and confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindanao command, told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nErmita said Saturday that three charges of multiple murders were filed in court, and that 24 people were charged with rebellion. The Philippine National Police has referred nearly 900 other cases to the Department of Justice, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael \"Toto\" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Newburgh, New York, was a main military headquarters for George Washington during the American Revolution. More recently, authorities say, it was the birthplace of a foiled terrorist plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Mayor Nick Valentine gets his way, the town of 30,000 will host the terror trial of accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged accomplices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got nothing to lose,\" said Valentine, who also runs a tailor shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 60 miles up the Hudson River from New York City, Newburgh struggles with poverty, unemployment and crime. In 2004, the town was dubbed the third worst metropolitan area in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes, we're the top five in crime, which is not a very good recognition,\" said Valentine, a lifelong resident. \"We struggle with everything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why, he said, the trial would be a boon for his town. The influx of security personnel would chase the bad people out; journalists and lawyers in town for the trial would provide a much-needed economic boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have said: If you have a trial, bad guys will come. My comment back to them: We've got bad guys right now,\" the mayor said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I had a police presence here for an extended period of time, this place would be a safer place. And in the end ... the city of Newburgh would be up a couple notches than where it was before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House has said it is considering changing the current plan to hold the 9/11 trial in lower Manhattan after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other officials expressed concerns about security, costs and disruption to the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour alternative locations around New York have been discussed: Governors Island, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, a prison complex in Otisville and Newburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree of the sites, including Newburgh, fall within Orange County, which lost 44 residents in the 9/11 attacks. The top county official is doing everything he can to make sure the trial stays out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to be known as the terrorist capital of the world,\" said Orange County Executive Edward Diana. \"I don't want them here. Nobody wants them here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one battle, he said, \"I will fight tooth and nail.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I have to shut down roads, if I have to sue the federal government, I will do just that. ... That's my stance, and I will never back off from there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral senators on Tuesday lined up against a civilian 9/11 trial, saying that they would try to cut off funding for it and that it should take place in a military court.\n\n\n\n\n\nMayor Valentine said he would allow the trial in his town only if Newburgh received the estimated $200 million needed for security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If it's going to cost us money, then forget it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also agrees with many lawmakers -- that the accused terrorists don't \"deserve a trial like any other citizen in the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But if the president of the United States wants a trial, let me put together a jury of peers from the Hudson Valley area,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe town recently built a $22 million courthouse, mandated by the state, and is struggling to pay its bills as a result, Valentine said. The federal funds would help get the town out of a mountain of debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nEver since he's spoken up for Newburgh, he said, people have been abuzz in his tailor shop. \"Customers have come in saying, 'You give it your best shot.' \" He added, \"I've had a couple of negative, but very, very few.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe town has a diverse population -- 36 percent Latino, 34 percent African-American and 28 percent white -- with a median household income of roughly $30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe town is the home of the 105th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard. Within its four square miles, there are 70 places of worship, including two synagogues and one mosque, the mayor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA tree planting last May honored a Muslim U.S. soldier from Newburgh who was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. The soldier, 1st Lt. Mohsin Naqvi, had signed up with the Army Reserve just four days after 9/11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're a proud city,\" the mayor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast June, four men, dubbed the Newburgh Four, were indicted in what prosecutors said was a plot to bomb two New York City synagogues and fire surface-to-air missiles at U.S. military planes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mayor lauded his law enforcement for its participation in that federal probe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have challenges. We have risen up to challenges in the past. We're very formidable,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, he hopes the town \"where George Washington refused the crown\" will have a new place in history: the town that sentences the 9/11 mastermind to death.",

But lately, activists are trying more in-your-face tactics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Lierre Keith, author of \"The Vegetarian Myth,\" the \"in-your-face\" part is quite literal. A former vegetarian who has publicly recanted, she was lecturing in San Francisco, California, last week, when three masked assailants shouted \"Go vegan!\" and lobbed chili pepper-laced pies at her.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in hard-core vegan circles -- which exclude using animal-based products for food, clothing, medicine or any other purpose -- such borderline-violent exploits are controversial.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore common is the approach of folks like newly converted talk show host Ellen Degeneres, who has been sharing recipes for vegan nachos along with her philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, recipes only go so far. And, more to the point, they don't get as much media attention. For many vegan and vegetarian activists, getting coverage is an art.\n\n\n\n\n\nPETA\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've ever read about a particularly outrageous pro-vegetarian campaign, there's a good chance that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was behind it. The folks at PETA seem to be firm believers in the idea that \"all media attention is good media attention,\" and the more shocking or ridiculous the stunt, the more media outlets will pick up the story.\n\n\n\n\n\nPETA was laughed at when it tried to rebrand fish as \"sea kittens,\" in hopes that the more cuddly name would make seafood a less appealing mealtime choice. It was criticized for the suggestion that recently deceased Oscar G. Mayer should be buried with his company's hot dog-shaped Wienermobile.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay cooked up horse meat on his show, PETA UK dumped a ton of manure outside his London restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlenty of ecological activists cringe at these kinds of prankish maneuvers, but they do get noticed. And that, apparently, is the point.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy else would PETA organize an army of zombies to protest outside of KFC restaurants?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot content to oppose meat-eating in the real world, PETA also took a swipe at virtual carnivorousness: In response to the Nintendo DS game \"Cooking Mama,\" the group released its own bloody version.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, as anyone who's seen its anti-fur posters knows, PETA is well aware that sex sells. The group got the granddaughter of Argentinean revolutionary Che Guevara to pose wearing nothing but a bandolier filled with carrots.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, year PETA proposed a too-racy-for-TV \"vegetarians have better sex\" Super Bowl commercial, guaranteeing plenty of coverage when -- surprise! -- NBC rejected the ad.\n\n\n\n\n\nPETA also brings its soft-core approach to the streets with its \"Lettuce Ladies\" campaign: young models, clad in a few strategically placed leaves, handing out veggie hot dogs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group has enlisted Pamela Anderson and Elizabeth Berkley to pose for the Lettuce Ladies Web site (find it yourself) -- probably the best thing that's happened to their careers in years. Is there tofu wresting? Yes, there is tofu wrestling.\n\n\n\n\n\nCasa Diablo\n\n\n\n\n\nPETA is not alone in combining feminine pulchritude and an anti-meat agenda. A couple of years back, Portland, Oregon, resident Johnny Diablo got a bunch of media attention when he opened Casa Diablo, the world's first vegan strip club.\n\n\n\n\n\nServing veggie burgers with a side of nudity (or maybe the other way around) might seem to be just a publicity stunt. (The fact that Diablo tried to put the club up for sale shortly after opening would seem to suggest that.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Diablo is an earnest vegan himself, and he's apparently retained ownership of Casa Diablo, though reviews -- of both the cuisine and the more fleshy attractions -- are decidedly mixed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcVegan\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the most public face of our carnivorous culture, McDonald's is a popular target of vegetarian activism.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1985, the London branch of Greenpeace declared October 16 World Anti-McDonald's Day, and every year since, there have been protests and rallies all over the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group Vegan Action, founded by Berkeley students in 1993, has come up with a gentler -- and tastier -- way to combat the ubiquity of the golden arches. With its help, you can host your own \"McVegan\" event. There will be veggie burgers, there will be uniformed servers, and there will even be a costumed clown mascot -- Reggie McVeggie, \"Ronald's kinder brother.\" The slogan: \"Billions and billions saved.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVegan Avengers\n\n\n\n\n\nEven a green group like Friends of the Earth isn't safe from vegan wrath. Last year, the group hosted a comedy night at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, only to have the event crashed by masked activists wearing enormous artificial testicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey called themselves the \"Vegan Avengers,\" and their crude slogan suggested that the middle-of-the-road members of FoE should grow a similar pair by supporting veganism. The Avengers have not been heard from since their single appearance.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The Philippine government said Tuesday that fresh rain in Visayas and Mindanao could set off flash floods and landslides, bringing the potential for more misery in places already struggling to recover from a deadly tropical storm.\n\n\n\n\n\nEastern Luzon will experience cloudy skies with scattered rain, while the rest of the island will have mostly cloudy skies with light rain, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) predicted.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the national government offered a new death toll -- 1,453 -- then revised it again based on a count by Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The lower count means the death toll from the storm that lashed the southern Philippines more than a week remained unchanged from Monday: 1,249.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bodies of people swept out to sea by flash floods from the storm have washed up on nearby beaches and islands, Maj. Reynaldo Balido, the military assistant for operations at the Office of Civil Defense, said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authorities have enlisted the help of local fishermen to help the continuing search and rescue efforts for the scores of people who remain missing, Balido said by telephone from the island of Mindanao, the scene of the worst devastation. He added that the fishermen volunteered, since many of them had lost friends and relatives in the disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unusually heavy rains of Tropical Storm Washi, which churned across the southern Philippines between December 16 and 18, resulted in landslides and flash floods that swept away whole villages. The authorities have had to carry out mass burials in order to deal with the large numbers of dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've gone through many disasters but this one is the worst as some of the survivors have lost so many family members,\" said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine Red Cross.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some have lost as many as 30 relatives,\" he said in comments posted recently on the organization's website.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of people injured as a result of the storm has more than doubled to 4,594 from 1,979 at the weekend, according to the NDRRMC putting more pressure on already stretched relief agencies\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations said last week that the storm has created \"huge\" humanitarian needs in the region. It has made an appeal to raise $28 million to deal with the immediate problems, with tens of thousands of people displaced in and around the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people are lacking food, shelter and clean drinking water, the United Nations said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have also established make-shift camps and relief centers for victims in local schools in the area, but because schools are opening on January 3, we are looking to find them more permanent shelter,\" Benito Ramos, head of the NDRRMC, said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storm, known locally as Sendong, has affected more than 700,000 people in the region, the NDRRMC estimated Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Benigno Aquino of the Philippines has declared a state of national calamity following the storm.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Jethro Mullen and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.",

A real war is going on.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Dana Perino said: \"I want to reiterate on [President Bush's] behalf that the United States supports Georgia's territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire.\n\n\n\n\"We urge all parties, Georgians, South Ossetians and Russians to de-escalate the tension and avoid conflict.

We urge an immediate cease-fire in the fighting in South Ossetia and for a resumption of direct dialogue between all parties.\"\n\n\n\nGeorgia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, is now looking west and has ambitions of joining NATO.\n\n\n\nSouth Ossetia has longed for and sometimes fought for independence since the 1920s when the Soviet Government made it an autonomous region within Georgia.\n\n\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia broke away from Moscow in 1991 and South Ossetia voted overwhelmingly for its own independence.\n\n\n\nViolence has been mounting in the region in recent days, with sporadic clashes between Georgian forces and South Ossetian separatists.\n\n\n\nGeorgian troops launched new attacks in South Ossetia late Thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease-fire offer was met with separatist artillery fire.\n\n\n\nAn emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Friday discussed the dramatic escalation of violence. The session ended Friday morning without a statement about the fighting.",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States Mint launched a new coin Tuesday featuring jazz legend Duke Ellington, making him the first African-American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe District of Columbia coin honoring Duke Ellington was introduced Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllington, the composer of classics including \"It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing\" appears on the \"tails\" side of the new D.C. quarter. George Washington is on the \"heads\" side, as is usual with U.S. quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coin was issued to celebrate Ellington's birthplace, the District of Columbia.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Mint Director Ed Moy introduced the new coin at a news conference Tuesday at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of Ellington's family were present at the ceremony, and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllington won the honor by a vote of D.C. residents, beating out abolitionist Frederick Douglass and astronomer Benjamin Banneker.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on the coin is the phrase \"Justice for all.\" The Mint rejected the first inscription choice of D.C. voters, which was \"taxation without representation,\" in protest of the district's lack of voting representation in Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington received 13 Grammy Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, among numerous other honors. His orchestra's theme song, \"Take the A Train,\" is one of the best-known compositions in jazz.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllington was born in the district in 1899 and composed more than 3,000 songs, including \"Satin Doll,\" \"Perdido\" and \"Don't Get Around Much Any More.\" \"It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing\" helped usher in the swing era of jazz.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllington performed with other famous artists, including John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, and he traveled around the world with his orchestras.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe died in 1974 at the age of 75.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first African-American to appear on a circulating coin was York, a slave who accompanied Lewis and Clark on their \"Corps of Discovery\" adventures across America at the dawn of the 19th century. The 2003 Missouri quarter features the three men together in a canoe on the obverse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Mint distinguishes between circulating coins, which are intended for daily use, and commemorative ones, which mark special occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican-Americans including Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier, have appeared on commemorative coins. Educator Booker T. Washington, botanist George Washington Carver and the first Revolutionary War casualty, Crispus Attucks, all of whom were black, have also appeared on commemorative coins, according to the U.S. Mint.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Of all of the calculations Zainab Ibrahim made during her accounting career in Baghdad, this one was a snap.\n\n\n\nIraqi refugee Zainab Ibrahim lives in a modest, sparsely furnished apartment outside Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\nAfter a bullet whizzed by her head and death threats showed up at her doorstep, it was time, she figured, to leave. She went to Jordan four years ago and arrived last June at her ultimate destination -- the United States.\n\n\n\nOnce a target of insurgents because her job at the Iraqi Finance Ministry involved working with the U.S. military, Ibrahim is now trying to avoid another pitfall -- falling through the cracks of America's recession.\n\n\n\nShe and thousands of refugees across America who fled war and persecution just can't seem to find full-time jobs in a weak economy. And that just doesn't add up for Ibrahim, who has bachelor's and master's degrees in accounting from Baghdad University and risked her life for the U.S. government.\n\n\n\n\"It's everybody's dream being in the United States. I thought I would get the opportunity I always dreamed about,\" she said in fluent English in her sparsely furnished apartment outside Atlanta, Georgia. \"I'm really shocked. I found out everything is slow.\"   View video highlights from her interview \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe recession has made life tough nationwide for refugees.\n\n\n\n\"It's the most challenging time I've seen and I've been doing this work for 25 years,\" said Robert J. Carey, vice president of resettlement and migration policy at the International Rescue Committee, one of several nonprofit organizations that the U.S. government pays to resettle refugees.\n\n\n\nLavinia Limon, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, says, \"it's a significant problem.\"\n\n\n\n\"All refugees are required to become self-sufficient in a very fast time period. Our program is designed with that in mind. There isn't a long-term basis of support,\" said Anastasia Brown, director of refugee programs for the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops. \"What we have right now is a situation where it's becoming more and more difficult to find employment in a very short time period.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government resettles a limited number of refugees each year. They have full legal rights to live and work in the United States and can apply to become U.S. citizens after five years.\n\n\n\nBoth the U.S. State and the Health and Human Services departments pay for limited refugee services.\n\n\n\nThe State Department allocation for living expenses per refugee on arrival to the country is $450, a sum the department calls \"modest.\" Individual refugees also are eligible to get eight months of cash assistance and medical assistance under the HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\n\n\nDepending on states' eligibility requirements, refugee families could be eligible for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and Medicaid. State governments stipulate welfare benefit cash levels. There are five years' worth of social services, such as English language instruction.\n\n\n\nRefugee agencies across America pursue various state and federal programs that can help newcomers stay afloat, but they say they rely more and more on private donations to help provide food, clothing, money and furniture. That increasing reliance on community support shows that the U.S. program for resettling refugees needs reform, resettlement agencies argue.\n\n\n\nThree agencies -- Church World Service, Episcopal Migration Ministries, and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service -- said in a recent statement that \"the recession is making it harder for refugee newcomers to find jobs within 180 days of arrival as the program prescribes.\"\n\n\n\nThey said the government's \"one-size-fits-all\" approach -- the $450 per refugee and eight months of limited cash assistance plus food stamps and Medicaid -- \"reflects neither what resettlement actually costs nor the importance the U.S. refugee program holds in U.S. foreign policy,\" they said.\n\n\n\nThe public-private partnership that has been the \"genius\" of the U.S. program has \"fallen out of balance,\" with the private sector is bearing much of the cost, these agencies say.\n\n\n\nMore than 60,000 refugees were admitted to the United States during the fiscal year 2008, according to figures from the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. The largest number was from Burma, with 18,139. There were 13,823 from Iraq.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, refugees -- no matter their skill level -- have had a better chance of landing menial jobs, in places like hotels or restaurants or in plants with low-paying and arduous jobs. Now refugees are competing with Americans for low-paying jobs. Many are having a hard time finding the non-skilled positions.\n\n\n\nRefugee support agencies are scouring the job market, exploring job opportunities on farms as well as work in other sectors of the economy, said Carey, the International Rescue Committee senior vice president. He's also chairman of the Refugee Council USA, a coalition of non-government organizations helping refugees.\n\n\n\n\"For the first time I'm aware of,\" he said, \"large numbers of refugees are receiving eviction notices.\"\n\n\n\nIt's even hard for those refugees who go places where they have friends, relatives or members of their same faith.\n\n\n\nIn San Diego, California, Iraqi Chaldean Christian refugees are facing strains despite having access to an established Chaldean community, said Michael McKay, refugees services department director of Catholic Charities in San Diego.\n\n\n\nThere's \"great competition\" for jobs, from menial to highly skilled. Several Iraqis in San Diego have even talked about returning to Iraq.\n\n\n\nYet some communities still have those one or two big employers with jobs well-suited to newcomers.\n\n\n\nIn Bowling Green, Kentucky, refugees from Burma, Burundi, Iraq, Cuba and Bhutan have over the years found low-paying factory jobs that Americans shun, such as work at a Perdue Farms chicken processing plant, said James Robinson, executive director of The Bowling Green International Center.\n\n\n\nHow long will that last?\n\n\n\n\"We're good now,\" said Robinson. \"But you never know what tomorrow will bring.\"\n\n\n\nBack in Atlanta, Zainab Ibrahim makes no bones about how she feels: She wants work in her field, as an accountant, not just any job. But she knows she has to recalibrate her goals.\n\n\n\nShe worked from September to November as a foreign language specialist with the U.S. Army in Mississippi, working with soldiers before they deployed to Iraq. During tax season this year, she worked another temporary job, as an assistant office manager and tax preparer for the Tax Service of America Inc..\n\n\n\nYet to her dismay, she has been unable to find what she covets -- a full-time job. She has produced a resume, gone to job fairs, and applied for clerical and administrative full-time jobs at places like hotels.\n\n\n\nShe mines the job sites on the Web every day, using a computer at the public library because she can't afford Internet or cable service at home.\n\n\n\nDavid Oliver, the IRC job developer who works with her, said \"the recession is a big factor\" in her predicament. She is competing with other Americans for jobs and, he said, \"I think employers prefer to take somebody whose work experience is recognizable.\"\n\n\n\nAlong with refugee cash assistance and food stamps, Ibrahim saved money from her part-time jobs, and her family in the Middle East is ready to help her as they did when she lived in Jordan.\n\n\n\nLiving frugally, she has been able to pay $600 a month to rent her sparsely furnished apartment. She has a $60 a month phone bill and a fluctuating power bill that once reached $240 a month. There's $50 to $60 a week in food and then gas for her car.\n\n\n\nIbrahim's money is running out, and she wonders whether she will be able to pay her next month's rent. Oliver says there's help, such as IRC emergency funds and local rent assistance, but Ibrahim yearns to support herself, to pay her own way.\n\n\n\nHer struggles disappoint Louis Culpepper, president and chief executive officer of Culpepper & Associates Security Services in Atlanta. Ibrahim worked for his firm in Baghdad, and Culpepper called her a \"real go-getter.\"\n\n\n\n\"I really feel bad about it that someone who put her life on the line can't get a job,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIbrahim exudes optimism and determination despite her frustrations. She reminds herself that she survived the war and is still living a dream in America. And she applied for a job not long ago.\n\n\n\n\"Keep your fingers crossed,\" she said.",

There have been no substantiated reports of civilian casualties in this engagement,\" said Capt. Vanessa R. Bowman, a U.S. Army spokeswoman.\n\n\n\n\"The targets were carefully chosen to pinpoint enemy positions and eliminate the likelihood of harming innocent civilians,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"This region has provided an ideal environment to conceal enemy support bases and training sites, as well as plan and launch attacks aimed at terrorizing innocent civilians, both inside and outside the region.\"\n\n\n\nAlso Wednesday, a manager at a private British security firm in Afghanistan was shot and killed in the capital Kabul, a spokesman for the company said.\n\n\n\n\"We did lose a manager today in Kabul to unknown assailants,\" Christopher Beese, spokesman for ArmorGroup International, said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHe said next of kin have been notified and an inquiry into the incident has begun.

  "context": "Editor's note: On CNN's \"State of the Union,\" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on issues affecting communities across the country.\n\n\n\nCounty administrator Brenda T. Buck is trying hard to help create eight to 10 sawmill jobs for Jefferson County.\n\n\n\nFAYETTE, Mississippi (CNN) -- The odds are against Brenda T. Buck, and she knows it. So she counts on what she calls the Sandwich Philosophy: \"Take it one bite at a time.\"\n\n\n\nBuck is the county administrator in Jefferson County, a rural area in southwest Mississippi dotted with small churches, modest homes and markers noting a Civil War skirmish.\n\n\n\n\"It is a great small town, and everybody knows everybody,\" Buck says.\n\n\n\nIf you look through the statistics, three things jump out:\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Census Bureau lists the population of Jefferson County as 86 percent African American, the highest percentage of any county in the United States.\n\n\n\n\u2022 It is the fourth-poorest county in the United States, with a median income of $15,037.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The unemployment rate in August was 18.6 percent, the highest of Mississippi's 82 counties.\n\n\n\n\"It has not always been this way,\" says Angelia Shelvy, a single mother of three who is among the unemployed. \"I think we are forgotten.\"\n\n\n\nShelvy had a job making $10,000 a year as a teacher's assistant, but she left it to take a job paying twice as much, signing on with a union that provides workers to nuclear power plants. Her parents agreed to care for her children when she had to travel, for months at a time, as far away as Arizona.\n\n\n\nShelvy thought it was the right thing to do for her family, but phone calls to home at bedtime proved otherwise. Her 4-year-old, especially, had a rough time adjusting.\n\n\n\n\"I'm like, 'You have Granny.' He's like, 'No, I don't want Granny; I want you to hold me,' \" Shelvy told us. \"I missed Mother's Day twice; for two years I missed it. ... So I decided that it was more important for me to be here with my children.\"\n\n\n\nBack home now, she has been searching for work since March, looking as far as 90 minutes away from Fayette.\n\n\n\n\"I did Internet searching, different jobs, hospitals, different schools,\" she said. \"They're not hiring. They either say they are not hiring, or I'm not qualified. I don't have enough years of experience. 'We'll call you later.' 'Get back with us.' And it's been stressful for me.\"\n\n\n\nBuck spends hours a day trying to help, and most of her time with the Board of Supervisors is spent debating economic development ideas. At home, too, she is reminded of the bleak local jobs market.\n\n\n\nHer husband isn't there. He's working 900 miles away, at the moment, in Indiana.\n\n\n\n\"He works with a company that has been going into a lot of the car plants\" during refittings and downsizing, Buck said. \"We have four kids. ... He is here basically maybe a total combination of, maybe, two months out of the year.\"\n\n\n\nThe county got a modest amount of federal money to buy new police cruisers. But its requests for stimulus money to improve its roads have been ignored, at least to date, and as Buck continues to press those requests, she also is pushing smaller economic development grants.\n\n\n\nReliable Mat LLC is her current obsession. The screeching hum of a giant saw greets visitors, and inside the warehouse are dozens of pallets of neatly stacked firewood, waiting to be loaded on 18-wheelers and distributed across the country for the coming winter.\n\n\n\nOn the grounds, there are 10 workers, some running giant logs through the saw, others stacking and wrapping the wood for shipment. On average, the men make about $100 day, and Paul Southerland, the company's general manager, says the noise and activity attracts others who are down on their luck.\n\n\n\n\"I see a lot of people come by looking for jobs, yeah,\" Southerland says during a tour of the grounds.\n\n\n\nThe company's main product is giant wooden mats used to create flat surfaces to provide access -- on foot and in vehicles -- to oil and gas fields. All of the work has shifted to the firewood production because orders for the mats have dropped dramatically.\n\n\n\n\"Mississippi is always last to feel the effects of a recession, and most of the time it is the last to pick back up,\" Southerland said. \"It hit us about June. .. It really hit us hard, too.\"\n\n\n\nStill, Southerland expects orders to pick up early next year. He hopes to expand the business by then if the county secures an economic development grant to help him buy a bigger sawmill.\n\n\n\n\"If we had that sawmill, we would be able to add eight or 10 more folks,\" Southerland said.\n\n\n\nEight or 10 more jobs might not seem like much in many places. But Jefferson County's population is just shy of 9,000, and when nearly one in five are unemployed, Buck invokes her Sandwich Philosophy.\n\n\n\n\"My short term goal is to get that grant, to get those eight people working,\" she says. \"My philosophy, when I walk through the doors in the morning, just like a sandwich: take one bite at a time.\"\n\n\n\nShe also sees a bigger gain than just eight or 10 jobs.\n\n\n\n\"Just imagine, eight people, if it were eight men making $10 to $11 an hour could actually come home and be home at night with their families,\" she said. \"The impact that it would make not just from the economical standpoint but from the social standpoint.\n\n\n\n\"That father's presence there in that household and not having to travel so far. I mean you have a double whammy. It's a win-win for any family.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- No play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball. And no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not just robots they send out there,\" umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet these figures -- the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment -- are vastly different in importance to the average fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are countless children who dream of becoming a major-league pitcher. He is, literally, the king of the hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires? Almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet the positions share a number of similarities, according to two new books: \"As They See 'Em\" (Scribner), by New York Times writer Bruce Weber, and \"The Complete Game\" (Knopf), by former major-league pitcher (and current New York Mets broadcaster) Ron Darling.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth jobs require a great deal of command, neither gets enough training, and both are often disrespected by others in the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers (Jim Bouton's \"Ball Four,\" Jim Brosnan's \"The Long Season,\" Christy Mathewson's \"Pitching in a Pinch\"), Darling said he believes that people still don't understand what it takes to stand on that mound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'If pitchers weren't so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' \" he said in an e-mail. \"Of course, I knew this was a fallacy so I decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers. Throwing a ball 95 mph to tin cup-sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me, and I wanted to express this to the reader.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human. (\"The owners basically see them like bases,\" former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent told Weber. \"They say, 'We need a base; we need an umpire; same thing.' \") Weber found a fraternity (and they are almost all men) much like cops or soldiers: tight-lipped believers in baseball law and order.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeber immersed himself in the \"land of umpires,\" as the book's subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary Doug Harvey, who was called \"God\" for his imperious demeanor. What he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field, a matter not just of eyesight but positioning, rule-book knowledge and basic guts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's really what [being an umpire] is about -- is being in charge,\" he said. \"If there's anything that characterizes the major league umpire, it's that special kind of chutzpah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men. Aside from the vitriol they face -- the managers kicking dirt, the spectators yelling \"Kill the ump\" -- they're second-guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management, as Weber reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the 1999 umpires' strike.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes. (MLB does run an annual umpire camp.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDarling echoes Weber's concerns in his own field, pitching. In these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are \"undertrain[ed],\" he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks \"never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches.\" That leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning, he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles,\" he says. \"Identifying and preserving million-dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDarling's book is a chronicle of pitchers' thought processes, using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point. He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he remembered the games vividly. \"I definitely watched tapes and read box scores, but I was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days. A little scary and maybe a major personality flaw!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPitchers get more support than umpires, of course. Darling observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well-pitched game \"is one of sport's most beautiful dances. I would not have said it when I was playing, but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process. You did something together that could not have been done alone, and nobody can understand what you went through to get there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires, too, take pride in their best moments, though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires. More common is to be vilified for missed calls. Weber devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired Don Denkinger, a 29-year veteran remembered by fans (if he's remembered at all) for a wrong call in the 1985 World Series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough time has dulled the pain, \"I think he lives with [that call] every day,\" Weber said. \"When a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it, it must be devastating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks. When watching games now, the Yankees fan says, he'll focus on the umpires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just think umpiring is interesting. People hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but I don't,\" he said. \"Now I'm always interested who the umpires are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is a point the umpires would appreciate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Umpires are people, too,\" veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber. \"We have families; we have emotions. ... Somebody says, 'Kill the umpire,' and people go, 'Heh, heh, that's funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're human. We're not just robots they send out there.\"",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached an important milestone Wednesday in her quest to pay the debt from her failed 2008 presidential bid: For the first time in eight months, her campaign committee reported having more money in the bank than it owes.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign committee reported owing $2.3 million in debt at the end of March.\n\nOn a day most Americans were preoccupied with filing their federal income taxes, Clinton's campaign committee filed finance documents with the Federal Election Commission, reporting a total of $2.3 million in debts at the end of March, compared with $2.6 million in the bank.\n\nThe nation's top diplomat has been steadily chipping away at unpaid campaign bills since suspending her White House bid in June 2008, when her debt peaked at $25.2 million. That amount covered $12 million owed to vendors, as well as the $13.2 million she loaned her campaign from personal funds.\n\nClinton's campaign was unable to repay that personal loan by the time the Democratic National Convention convened in Denver, Colorado, last August, the deadline mandated by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. The former New York senator was forced to forgive the entire loan amount.\n\nHer campaign owed $6.4 million to 16 creditors at the end of November; $5.9 million to five creditors at the end of December; and the current $2.3 million owed to just one creditor at the end of March. That creditor is Penn, Schoen & Berland, a political consulting and polling firm that advised Clinton during her presidential bid. The firm's president, Mark Penn, was Clinton's senior campaign strategist until he stepped down last April amid revelations that he had lobbied on behalf of Colombia for a U.S.-Colombia trade deal that Clinton opposed. Penn remained involved with the campaign.\n\nEarlier this year, Clinton and her supporters raced to pay as much of the debt as possible by the time she was confirmed and sworn in as the nation's 67th secretary of state on January 21. As of that date, Clinton became subject to a federal law known as the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from personally soliciting or accepting political contributions. The Hatch Act allows others to keep raising money on Clinton's behalf, without her direct involvement.\n\nThis week, longtime Clinton ally James Carville, a CNN contributor, sent a fundraising e-mail to Democrats on behalf of Clinton's campaign, requesting contributions of as little as $5 in exchange for a chance to win one of several prizes, including spending a day with former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"I won't spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help Hillary,\" Carville e-mailed. \"I know what she means to you, and I'm sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether the campaign will use the $2.6 million in the bank to clear its $2.3 million in debts in the short term. Continued fundraising indicates that it will not. Additional operating expenses and other outlays could emerge.\n\nAny extra money from the campaign could be donated to political causes or returned to donors.\n\nClinton's campaign reported raising $938,000 in contributions in the first three months of 2009.\n\nIn addition to tapping traditional fundraising, the campaign also generated money by selling or renting various campaign assets to other organizations. It received $2.6 million from Clinton's \"Friends of Hillary\" U.S. Senate campaign committee for the sale of unspecified assets and an additional $2.2 million from renting out its lists of campaign supporters.\n\nOrganizations that have rented Clinton's lists include the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the inaugural committee of then-President-elect Barack Obama, and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation. Those organizations each paid $274,297. Clinton's political action committee, HillPAC, rented the lists for $822,492.\n\nAmong the Democratic candidates who have rented Clinton's campaign lists are Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln; Virginia gubernatorial candidate and former Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe; New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who was appointed to fill Clinton's seat; and New York congressional candidate Scott Murphy, who hopes to succeed Gillibrand in the U.S. House.",

  "context": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Saudi King Abdullah confirmed Sunday that his country will increase daily oil production from 9 million barrels to 9.7 million in the near future to counter the sharp rise in international oil prices.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has announced an increase in oil production in a  bid to ease the pressure on oil prices.\n\n\n\nThe Saudi petroleum minister, Ali I. Al-Naimi, said the country will reach the 9.7 million level by July. The announcement comes after Saudi officials announced modest increases.\n\n\n\nIt would be Saudi Arabia's highest production rate since 1981.\n\n\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto praised the step, saying, \"Any increase in production in today's oil market is welcome. It is important that we also take steps to increase domestic production and our refining capacity.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the average price of gasoline in the U.S. rose nearly 10 cents in the past two weeks to almost $4.10 a gallon for self-serve regular, according to a national survey released Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe survey showed the national average was just a fraction of a cent under $4.10 a gallon, said survey publisher Trilby Lundberg. That is up 9.7 cents a gallon from the same survey two weeks ago, Lundberg said.\n\n\n\nSen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, downplayed the Saudi increase.\n\n\n\n\"Nice try, but no cigar. When gas is at $4 per gallon, demand increases almost daily, and the Saudis have millions of barrels per day more in spare capacity,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"This isn't nearly good enough.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Naimi, the petroleum minister, also said the Saudi government will invest in oil projects that would allow Saudi Arabia to have the capacity to produce 12.5 million barrels per day by the end of next year.\n\n\n\nKing Abdullah's announcement came at the end of the Jeddah energy summit, where he also called for OPEC to set aside $1 billion for a strategy to ease the oil price crisis.\n\n\n\nHe said $500 million should be given to developing nations to help them get the energy they need.\n\n\n\nKing Abdullah said there are \"many factors that made oil prices high.\" Along with increased demand, he also cited oil speculators and an increase in taxes in consumer nations.\n\n\n\n\"Now we see a lot of people point the finger at OPEC as it is solely responsible for this,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe king's statement came a day after U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, attending the summit, blamed the record oil prices on lack of production.\n\n\n\n\"All nations must be better at conservation, and the U.S. is at the top of that list,\" said Bodman, who met with journalists ahead of the international meeting of oil producing and consuming nations focusing on high oil prices.\n\n\n\nSome observers have blamed speculators for driving up oil prices. A key adviser to Saudi Arabia's oil minister said Friday that a number of factors, including speculators and currency fluctuations, are to blame for rising oil prices.\n\n\n\n\"We need stability,\" Dr. Ibrahim al Muhanna said, adding that Saudi Arabia would like to see producers, consumers and distributors cooperate.\n\n\n\nBut Bodman said he did not believe that they are the cause. Since 2003, he said, global demand for oil has increased because of industry in China, India and the Middle East. But from 2005 to 2007, there was very little increase in supply.\n\n\n\nNations need an additional supply of energy to market, whether that energy is nuclear, coal, fossil fuels, solar or wind power, Bodman said.\n\n\n\n\"We spent 30 years digging ourselves into this hole,\" he said. \"It won't be solved soon.\"\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, President Bush asked Congress to permit drilling for oil in deep water off the U.S. coast to combat rising oil prices.\n\n\n\nHe also renewed his demand that Congress allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, clear the way for more refineries and encourage efforts to recover oil from shale in areas like the Green River Basin, which encompasses parts of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\n\n\"In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home,\" Bush said in a Rose Garden statement.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- I have vivid memories of childhood. The 5-year-old girl with endless questions; she wanted to discover the secrets of the entire world within minutes. She dreamed of being a doctor once, an engineer another time, and a mother of lovely kids. A dreamer, this is how I would describe the little girl Reem.\n\n\n\nReem is a 22-year-old student living in Gaza City.\n\n\n\nDays passed fast. Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME.\n\n\n\nI remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet.\n\n\n\nI can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration.\n\n\n\nI can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth \u00bb\n\n\n\nSometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place.\n\n\n\nBut life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school.\n\n\n\nI was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media.\n\n\n\nAll my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally.\n\n\n\nMy ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian.\n\n\n\nUsually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be.\n\n\n\nIt's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom.\n\n\n\nI found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do. There are also lovely differences between us: I tried to cook what she taught me once, and she is learning Arabic now.\n\n\n\nMaybe our lifestyle is different. I focus on my own development; I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills. I do not work hard because I am super girl or I aspire to be one but because I always want to be ready for the worst situation. In Palestine where I live, surprises can happen at any time, and I don't want to be caught off guard. I want to make my future secure by being a really good person. I deserve to live.\n\n\n\nI enjoy my life as it is now, but I hope that when I find a scholarship and live in the West, I will not be obliged to take off my scarf and won't hear negative comments about me because I am Muslim. I consider religion a personal freedom that is related to your beliefs and what you feel in your heart. I love letting others live in peace. ... Why can't we enjoy peace, too?\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.",

  "context": "(This Old House) -- Unless you're a perfect caretaker of your lawn (and, really, who is?), prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer. You'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions, of course. And an attack from the crabgrass. But you'll face more stealthy opponents, too: root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown.\n\n\n\n\"If a lawn is neglected, or cared for in a hit-or-miss way, it gets weak,\" says This Old House landscape contractor Roger Cook. \"And that's when weeds, insects, or fungal diseases become a major problem.\" Little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders.\n\n\n\nBut as in most battles, the best defense is a strong offense: doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf. That means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height (ask your local garden center what's best where you live); and fertilizing in spring and fall.\n\n\n\nSo promise yourself -- and your turf -- you'll do that this year. In the meantime, here's how to conquer the most common turf problems you're likely to confront this summer.\n\n\n\nFungal disease\n\n\n\nSymptoms: Circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass; or blades with tiny red threads.\n\n\n\nCulprits: Powdery mildew, brown patch, dollar spot, and fusarium patch; or red thread. These fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf.\n\n\n\nSolutions: Though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection, if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard, look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions. For an organic fix, search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi. Then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits: Avoid excessive shade (prune back trees and large shrubs, if necessary) and too many applications of fertilizer, herbicides, or pesticides. Carefully monitor your turf's moisture intake and never water in the evening.\n\n\n\nWeeds\n\n\n\nSymptoms: Fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass. This Old House: What type of grass is right for your yard\n\n\n\nCulprits: Crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, purslane, henbit, and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass hasn't completely taken root. To check for compacted soil, stick a screwdriver into the ground; it should slide in easily.\n\n\n\nSolutions: The first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders. The best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe. This will also loosen the soil in affected areas. Or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation. If weeds are too plentiful to be pulled, check your garden center for a \"weed-and-feed\" blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area, or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten. Be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly, as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic.\n\n\n\nFrom here on out, mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly, and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods. Water well as the summer heats up, and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds. In the fall, open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard, or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn. You may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring.\n\n\n\nInsects\n\n\n\nSymptoms: Brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat.\n\n\n\nCulprits: White grubs, a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae, including june bugs, Japanese beetles, and masked chafers. To be sure that's what you've got, cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back, looking for pale, half-inch- to inch-long C-shaped bugs. If you find more than six, treat the turf. This Old House:  Meet the good bugs\n\n\n\nSolutions: Grubs are the biggest threat to lawns, and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective. For an organic fix, spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they're present. With nematodes, timing the application with their life cycle is critical, so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly. Both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online (gardensalive.com).\n\n\n\nSymptoms: Irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass.\n\n\n\nCulprits: Chinch bugs, gray-black, quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack St. Augustine and zoysia grasses in the South and Kentucky bluegrass in the North. To spot them, bury an empty coffee can, with both ends removed, at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water. The bugs will seek out the moisture, then float to the top. If you see more than 10 after 20 minutes, you should address the problem.\n\n\n\nSolutions: Chinch bugs live on the surface, among thatch, so dethatching will reduce their numbers. To eradicate them completely, look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient. Longer-term, overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses.\n\n\n\nSymptoms: Patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base.\n\n\n\nCulprits: Sod webworms and tropical sod webworms, hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small, buff-colored moths at maturity. The tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm. To check for webworms, mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water; pour it over the infested turf. Any larvae will float to the top.\n\n\n\nSolutions: You can try flooding your lawn to drown them. Or choose an appropriate insecticide; in an organic product, look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad. With extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix.\n\n\n\nTIP: If dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn, keep a hose or water bucket nearby. Dog urine is high in nitrogen, which can \"burn\" turf, creating a good-sized yellow patch. The best fix is immediate action: Flush the area ASAP with water to dilute it. Once badly burned, grass won't come back on its own-you'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed.

  "context": "(CNN)  -- The long-running Carlos Tevez affair was finally brought to a close on Monday as West Ham and Sheffield United reached an out-of-court settlement.\n\n\n\nTevez scored a crucial winning goal at Manchester United on last day of the 2006-07 season.\n\n\n\nWest Ham will be paying  United an undisclosed compensation fee to settle the dispute, meaning an independent tribunal chaired Lord Griffiths will not reconvene to rule on the controversy.\n\n\n\nA statement from Blades chairman Kevin McCabe and West Ham chief executive Scott Duxbury released to the Press Association said: \"Both clubs are pleased to announce that a satisfactory settlement for compensation has been reached which brings the dispute between Sheffield United and West Ham to an end.\n\n\n\n\"The tribunal will not be resuming.\"\n\n\n\nThe Tevez controversy began in 2006 when the Argentina international and his fellow-countryman Javier Mascherano were signed by West Ham under third party ownership deals which contravened Premier League rules.\n\n\n\nMascherano was later loaned to Liverpool, but Tevez stayed at Upton Park and played a crucial role as West Ham narrowly avoided relegation.\n\n\n\nHe scored the winning goal as the Hammers beat Manchester United on the last day of the season to send Sheffield United down.\n\n\n\nTevez later joined Premier League champions Manchester United, but the row lingered on with Sheffield United continuing to insist that West Ham had gained an unfair advantage.\n\n\n\nThe affair has sparked three separate inquiries, the first of which led to a $8 million fine for West Ham, but crucially no points deduction.\n\n\n\nBut United refused to give up and in September 2008 an independent arbitration ruled in their favor in a claim for compensation from West Ham.\n\n\n\nThe Premier League and the Football Association promptly announced another fresh inquiry, but the out-of court settlement looks set to bring the affair to an amicable conclusion.\n\n\n\nWest Ham, whose Icelandic owner Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson has been hard hit by the global economic downturn, were reported by Sky Sports News to be paying the compensation fee, which could rise to $35 million, in installments.\n\n\n\nThe money will certainly be welcomed by Sheffield United, who are pressing for promotion from the Championship to the Premier League. \"We are two clubs with a fantastic footballing history who now want to move on and focus on the business of playing football -- hopefully for us against the Hammers in the Premier League next season,\" said McCabe.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Name: Kevin Evans\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight in January 1994: 315 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent weight: 215 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nSize change: Size 40 to size 32 pants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory: Evans never took his weight into consideration growing up. He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. \"I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,\" he said. \"After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. \"I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aha!\" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nHow he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. \"I think he takes more pride in himself,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: \"You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,\" Evans said. \"Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get. I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor's take: Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard. Dr. Jan McBarron, who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as, \"How do you feel about your weight?\" Then, if he or she seems ready to change, offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Mary J. Blige has sung her way to nine Grammy Awards and sold 40 million albums worldwide.\n\n\n\n\"I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting,\" Mary J. Blige said.\n\n\n\nWith music credentials like that, the \"Queen of Hip-Hop Soul\" needed a new challenge. So Blige decided to stretch her range to the big screen.\n\n\n\nThe singer stars in the new Tyler Perry film \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself\" alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson, Perry and Gladys Knight.\n\n\n\nBeing in the film allows Blige to test her acting chops and sing as well. Her character, Tanya, is a club owner who takes the mic at least twice in the film. And whether she's in character or not, Blige's ability to communicate a song can take your breath away.\n\n\n\nCNN spoke with Blige about Tyler Perry, her acting angst and music. The following is an edited version of that interview:\n\n\n\nCNN: What does the title of the film \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself\" mean?\n\n\n\nMary J. Blige: Well, the title \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself\" is basically saying \"I don't need anyone to help me do worse or feel worse than what I already feel.\" So if you're coming with negative energy, please keep it moving, you know? If you're coming with negative deposits, you've gotta go. That's basically what it's saying.\n\n\n\nCNN: Were you nervous about acting in this film?\n\n\n\nBlige: I was definitely nervous, because acting is not my first profession, so I had to go and get an acting coach and really figure this thing out. It helped a lot. It relaxed me to have a little more information about it.\n\n\n\nAnd I find that actors are highly underrated; they don't get all the credit they deserve, because this is a hard job. That's a hard job.\n\n\n\nCNN: Were you bitten by the acting bug?\n\n\n\nBlige: Well, I'm gonna be open to scripts, and I'm ready to receive more scripts from anywhere. I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting. I was definitely bitten by the acting bug.\n\n\n\nCNN: Did you feel any pressure to write songs for this film, as opposed to writing for one of your albums?\n\n\n\nBlige: There's not any pressure in writing songs. Writing a song for the movie versus writing songs for my album because ... you get it all from inspiration from somewhere, you know? I got all the lyrics from the actual movie, and I got all the lyrics for my songs from my life so, and other people's lives.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you want to hear poetry in your lyrics?\n\n\n\nBlige: I would love to hear poetry in my lyrics.\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell me about Tyler Perry.\n\n\n\nBlige: Wow, working with Tyler Perry was -- it's always a treat. He's the most kind, generous, you know, supportive professional man. He's a really good person to have in such a tough business. It's like a pillow for your head. ... You just get to lay on it after laying on rocks for so long.\n\n\n\nCNN: What is the link between spirituality and music in the film and in life?\n\n\n\nBlige: Well, I think the link with the spirituality and the music is that we all have a place where we need to go to heal, and most of the time people go to music to heal. Whether it be gospel or secular, but it all comes from some song that pulled you through your life or helped you through college or something like that.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you think this film is about redemption? Do you think people can really change?\n\n\n\nBlige: I definitely feel this film is a lot about redemption. You saving yourself first of all, and believing you can be saved and wanting the help.\n\n\n\nI think it takes time for people to heal from whatever wounds they're healing from. But in order to get free, what I learned is that you have to release it, because you'll stay stuck for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\nWhat if this person is enjoying their lives and you hate them? So it's just best to release. Easier said than done, please believe it.\n\n\n\nCNN: What do you think about the music industry these days?\n\n\n\nBlige: Well, I mean, the music industry has moved with the times. You know, I mean we are in the age where technology has taken over and  music is technology now, so it's not hands-on. It's a little sad that there isn't any more record stores.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- The building in Amstetten, eastern Austria, seems innocuous enough. But it is underneath this family home --- now known as \"the house of horror\" -- that a woman was held for nearly 24 years by her father and repeatedly raped, giving birth to seven children as a result.\n\n\n\nThe bathroom used by the woman, who was held captive for more than two decades, and her three children.\n\n\n\nNow the first images have begun to emerge of the series of rooms in which 73-year-old man Josef Fritzl says he imprisoned his daughter, and three of her surviving children, in a basement 50-60 meters square that he converted himself.\n\n\n\nPolice and authorities who have been down into the cellar after Fritzl gave them the electronic combination -- say that the rooms are very low, less than five-and-a-half feet high.\n\n\n\nThe rooms included a sleeping quarters, a kitchen and a bathroom, all of which are said to be \"very dark, narrow and damp,\" reports CNN correspondent Fred Pleitgen.  Watch a report on details of the case \u00bb\n\n\n\nElisabeth Fritzl has told officers that conditions were \"dire\" and that she and her children had little food and clothing. None had seen the light of day during their entire time in captivity, she told police.\n\n\n\nOne photograph shows the white-tiled walls and floors of the bathroom and some token attempts to introduce some semblance of normality.\n\n\n\nA small child-like cutout of a yellow snail has been stuck over the sink, while a large plastic elephant sits atop the green bathroom cabinet. Above that, as elsewhere in the bathroom, droops a small plastic plant.\n\n\n\nOther accoutrements of everyday life litter the scene, including a hot water bottle, a small wooden chair and a towel.\n\n\n\nWhat looks like a wooden glass-framed door has been painted red; through the doorway is the bath itself, crammed in next to a toilet with a green seat.\n\n\n\nAbove the bath is what looks like a large image of a flower, aside other decorations that appear to have been put on the walls.\n\n\n\nBut the overwhelming sense from the images is one of grimness. The only evident light in this windowless room comes from the small bulb set into the bathroom cabinet; despite the whiteness of the walls, floor and bathroom fittings, it is a room that cannot hide its oppression as one of the few rooms that the three children, if reports are correct, have ever known.\n\n\n\nOther pictures convey the grimness of the dungeon still further. A narrow corridor, just over the width of a floor tile, leads down from what seems to be a kitchen area to sleeping quarters.\n\n\n\nA table in the foreground appear to have a cloth over it; a dressing gown hangs from the hook. But the spartan conditions and cramped conditions cannot belie the rooms' true purpose.\n\n\n\nA third image shows a corner of the dungeon with a wooden wall and construction materials piled up in a heap. A set of tiles has been fixed to the wall in what seem to be two sides of a doorway, blocked by what looks like a white rectangular board.\n\n\n\nPolice at a press conference Monday said that this image showed the exit from the dungeon, controlled on the other side by an electronic keyless lock.

  "context": "(CNN) -- The Sri Lankan government should immediately release more than 280,000 displaced Tamil civilians living in detention camps, a leading human rights group said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTamil civilians are at Menik Farm refugee camp on the outskirts of the northern town of Vavuniya, Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the displaced Sri Lankans were already victims of a protracted and bloody civil war. Now they are victims again, confined against their will, like criminals, the global watchdog group said.\n\n\n\n\"Keeping several hundred thousand civilians who had been caught in the middle of a war penned in these camps is outrageous,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Right Watch. \"Haven't they been through enough?\"\n\n\n\nBut a Sri Lankan Defense Ministry spokesman said the Human Rights Watch report is overstated, and he defended the government's handling of the displaced.\n\n\n\n\"Those are not detention camps,\" said the spokesman, Lakshman Hulugalle. \"They are relief villages. All the basic facilities are being given to the people.\"\n\n\n\nSri Lanka declared victory in May in its 25-year battle with the Tamil Tiger rebels, but concerns remain about how the island nation can heal visceral war wounds.\n\n\n\nThe rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- waged war for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. As many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict.\n\n\n\nWith the cease-fire, the question of how to resettle Tamil refugees, many of whom were living among the rebels, has wrought intense criticism of the government from international humanitarian agencies.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations reported that as of July 19, Sri Lanka was detaining 281,621 people in 30 military guarded camps in the four northern districts of Vavuniya, Mannar, Jaffna and Trincomalee.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch said humanitarian workers are prohibited from discussing abuses or the final months of the ethnic conflict and that camp residents are allowed to leave only for emergency medical care, often only with military escort.\n\n\n\nIn some camps, people have to register with the military twice a day, the rights group said. If they fail, they are subject to punitive measures such as being forced to stand still under the sun for extended periods of time.\n\n\n\nThe group reported health problems created by inconsistent water supply and a shortage of bathroom facilities.\n\n\n\nBut Hulugalle, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said barbed wire around the compounds is a common way to define barriers in Sri Lanka and that military guards were being utilized out of security concerns. The government fears that rebels are hiding in the camps and screening people living in them.\n\n\n\n\"These are people who were kept for months in LTTE clutches,\" Hulugalle said, referring to the displaced civilians.\n\n\n\nHe said the government has a 180-day plan to resettle most people but that a lot of work was needed in the northern districts as far as rebuilding infrastructure and basic services destroyed in the fighting.\n\n\n\nThe human rights activists say, however, that the government is not working fast enough.\n\n\n\nHuman Right Watch said Sri Lanka's goal now is only to resettle 60 percent of the refugees by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State Eric Schwartz visited a camp this week in Vavuniya, after which he announced an additional $8 million in humanitarian aid for the northern districts.\n\n\n\nBut even in handing out dollars, Schwartz was critical of Sri Lanka's handling of the displaced.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, he acknowledged that providing food, shelter and medical care for the displaced people was a \"formidable task.\" But Schwartz said the United States remains \"deeply concerned\" about the confinement of people to camps and the hardships they endure within those camps.\n\n\n\nHe also criticized the restrictions placed on humanitarian workers visiting the camps.\n\n\n\n\"The government of the United States believes the focus now must be on the prompt return of the displaced in safety and dignity, and we want to accelerate this process,\" Schwartz said.\n\n\n\nIn addition to global humanitarian aid, the International Monetary Fund has approved a $2.6 billion loan to Sri Lanka to mend the country.\n\n\n\nAdams of Human Rights Watch said Sri Lanka, in need of global sympathy in its efforts to rebuild, could very well go the opposite way if the Tamil people, once subjugated by the rebels, keep waking up as prisoners of their own state.",

  "context": "Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- A moderate Islamist party claimed victory in Morocco's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Justice and Development Party (PJD) won 107 of the 395 seats, Interior Minister Taib Cherkaoui said Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next biggest winner was the Istiqlal Party, also known as the Independence Party, with 60 seats, the Interior Ministry's website reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of parties involved in Morocco's multiparty system means it was unlikely a single party would win a majority of the seats, so a coalition government would have to be formed.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered her congratulations Saturday \"on the successful completion\" of the elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The United States stands ready to work with the new parliament and the people of Morocco to strengthen the rule of law, raise human rights standards, promote transparent and accountable governance, and work toward sustained, democratic reform,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurnout in the North African country was 45%, the Interior Ministry said Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Democratic Institute -- which had 41 accredited observers from 21 countries that went to over 200 polling stations on Friday -- said in a news release that the elections \"were conducted transparently.\" The voting process was described as \"technically sound\" and \"without fear of tampering or procedural violations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut one institute member, Canadian Liberal Party leader Bob Rae, also pointed to the turnout and a number of invalid and spoiled ballots as negatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Seeing the number of people who actively spoiled their ballots as well as those who did not participate, it is clear that the path to real change will take more effort and time,\" Rae said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLise Storm, senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Exeter in England, said Friday that the outcome might signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more votes for the PJD appear to indicate a desire for greater change, she said -- as opposed to votes for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties, which would suggest voters favor the status quo.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new constitution, approved by referendum in July, both Parliament and the prime minister have greater powers, while the monarch's sway has been slightly lessened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- which, based on the preliminary results, would be the Justice and Development Party -- rather than King Mohammed VI selecting his own nominee for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reforms came after thousands of Moroccans took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year, inspired by what became known as the Arab Spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts say economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country's young people, particularly many university graduates who are unemployed.\n\n\n\n\n\nJournalist Aida Alami contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Nestle, one of the world's largest food companies, has reopened its factory in Zimbabwe after receiving assurances from the government that its business will not be interfered with again, an official with the Swiss-based company said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe company shut its Harare factory last month, complaining of harassment by authorities after it refused to take milk supplies from a farm that had been taken over by President Robert Mugabe's family as part of his controversial land reform program.\n\n\n\n\"On the basis of the written assurances given by the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Zimbabwe to guarantee the security of Nestle management and staff and not to interfere in the company's operating processes, Nestle decided to restart the activities at its Harare factory,\" said Brinda Chiniah with Nestle Equatorial African Region's corporate communications department.\n\n\n\n\"The company reiterates its commitment to source milk exclusively from its contracted farmers,\" Chiniah's statement added.\n\n\n\nMinister of industry and commerce of Zimbabwe, Welshman Ncube, confirmed that he held meetings with Nestle management.\n\n\n\n\"I was assigned by my superiors to have meetings with them, and I assured them that their concerns will be addressed. We cannot afford to lose investors at this stage when we are rebuilding the economy,\" Ncube said.\n\n\n\nThe Nestle shutdown was seen by many as a setback to the country's efforts to attract foreign investors to help shore up its battered economy.\n\n\n\nOperations were under way as normal at the Nestle plant in Harare on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nNestle said last month its decision to shut the facility was prompted by an unannounced visit from government officials and police December 19, after which the firm was forced to accept a milk delivery from non-contracted suppliers.\n\n\n\nTwo of its managers, including expatriate managing director Heath Tilley, were questioned by police and released without charge the same day.\n\n\n\nChiniah said Nestle had been in Zimbabwe for 50 years and employs more than 200 people in the southern African nation, adding that the company was \"working with the population of Zimbabwe and striving to maintain a long-term viable operation in often challenging conditions.\n\n\n\n\"We operate in Zimbabwe, as we do in every country, through good times and bad. We work for the long-term, in a way which has positive impact on our consumers, employees and suppliers,\" Chiniah said.\n\n\n\nNestle stopped buying milk from Gushungo Dairy Estate, owned by Mugabe's family, in October, following international criticism of a deal it had agreed to earlier in the year to use the farm as a supplier. The farm had been seized under Mugabe's controversial land reform program, which targets mainly the properties of white farmers.\n\n\n\nCritics say Mugabe's seizure of white-owned commercial farms to resettle landless black Zimbabweans -- who have no farming experience -- has ruined the country's once-prosperous economy.\n\n\n\nMugabe, in power since independence from Great Britain in 1980, denies the charge, and says the economic crisis is due to sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to his land reform.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- An eight-hour hostage standoff ended late Wednesday when an armed, disabled man wheeled himself out of a Virginia post office and was taken into custody, according to the mayor of Wytheville.\n\n\n\nInitially, authorities reported five people -- three postal workers and two customers -- were taken hostage after a man entered a Wytheville, Virginia, post office about 2:30 p.m. and fired a gun. But Mayor Trent Crewe said police later believed the gunman was holding fewer than five people and that they have accounted for people they thought could have been inside.\n\n\n\n\"Apparently they ran as it was unfolding and we didn't know that for a while,\" Crewe said.\n\n\n\nAn unidentified witness told CNN affiliate WDBJ that he, a fellow window clerk and the postmaster were in the building when the gunman entered, but they quickly fled. He added that his supervisor was one of the hostages.\n\n\n\nWDBJ reports on standoff\n\n\n\nCrewe said he did not know exactly how many hostages had been in the building.\n\n\n\nNo one was reported hurt, Crewe said.\n\n\n\nThe gunman is disabled, Crewe said, adding that police told him the gunman entered the post office pushing a wheelchair. It was unclear what the purpose of the wheelchair is, Crewe said.\n\n\n\nThere were reports the man had a \"device,\" and it appeared that his car, parked outside the office, was equipped with some type of device as well, Crewe said. He did not elaborate on what the device could be.\n\n\n\n\"The police authorities have told me they are acting on the assumption there is an explosive device of some kind in some location,\" Crewe said. \"There is a bomb squad, in fact more than one bomb squad on site, but we cannot confirm any explosives.\"\n\n\n\nThe surrounding area of downtown Wytheville has been evacuated within a three- to four-block radius, Crewe said.\n\n\n\nThe suspect asked for pizza but made no other demands, U.S. Postal Inspection Service spokesman Peter Rendina said.\n\n\n\nThe gunman's motive was unclear, Crewe said. He had not identified himself but he has told police he has a military background, Crewe said. Police have yet to confirm whether the gunman has military training, Crewe said.\n\n\n\nAgents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on scene, Crewe said.\n\n\n\nWytheville is a small town in southwestern Virginia in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It has a population of just over 8,000.\n\n\n\nCNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.",

Smith was brought to a local hospital in serious condition, officials said\n\n\n\nAt 7 p.m. Wednesday Smith died at Parkland Hospital, the medical examiner's office said. An autopsy is slated for Thursday.\n\n\n\nTwo people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.\n\n\n\nPolice used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMiller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first.\n\n\n\nThe first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers.\n\n\n\nWhile one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said.\n\n\n\n\"He was going to be traveling home,\" Lt. Miller said. \"He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location.\"\n\n\n\nMiller called the truck driver a hero because he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt.\n\n\n\nThe fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway, where gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said.\n\n\n\nSmith, 37, left his trooper job in Utah after he was caught abusing alcohol and drugs, CNN affiliate WFAA reported, citing an official report. The sergeant began using drugs and alcohol after his patrol car was rear-ended while he was writing a ticket, according to the report by Utah Peace Officers Standards and Training.\n\n\n\nHe moved to Texas shortly afterward, the station said.\n\n\n\nHarn told WFAA that Smith's wife had phoned police Monday to say her husband was suicidal and driving around with a gun. Police were able to locate him using cell phone transmission towers. A three-hour stand-off followed, ending when Smith shot himself in the head, Harn said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Fred Wiseman has been at the forefront of the American documentary scene ever since his bombshell of a first film in 1967.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Titicut Follies\" may sound like a burlesque extravaganza, but in fact the film was a deeply disturbing expose of life inside a correctional institution for the criminally insane.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, Wiseman has built up an extraordinary body of work. It includes nearly 40 feature films, many of them more than three hours long, largely preoccupied with examining the apparatus of social institutions: hospitals, high schools, parks and zoos. All of them are framed according to Wiseman's own rigorous observational style, which involves sustained scrutiny, no voice-over and no interviews. He's into process, not personality. With a Wiseman film, it's up to the viewer to supply the commentary.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's easier when the subject concerns alleged inadequate welfare programs or dysfunctional government institutions. In his last few films, the septuagenarian director has turned his gaze on less overtly political matters: the esteemed Ballet de l'Opera company in \"La Danse\" (2009); an Austin, Texas, training facility in \"Boxing Gym\" (2010); and now, a Parisian cabaret, in \"Crazy Horse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this loose-limbed documentary, Wiseman is more like an impressionist painter -- Degas is the obvious example -- than a social activist or a reporter. He's looking at the human body, at model physical specimens and at perceptions of beauty. \"Crazy Horse\" can be viewed as a series of nude studies built around the contrast between the dancers' casual nakedness backstage and the highly fetishistic, filtered nudity on stage. Surprisingly (and disappointingly), Wiseman foregrounds the latter; we scarcely learn the dancers' names and rarely hear them speak.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might expect marked differences between a distinguished ballet company and a glorified strip club, but Wiseman seems to see them in much in the same light (not literally; the chromatic effects at the club are designed to dazzle, and they do). The Crazy Horse, or \"Le Crazy\" for short, aspires to art with almost comical sincerity. This is Paris, after all, and intellectuals are a prime target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike \"La Danse,\" the new film dedicates most of its running time to rehearsal and performance, interspersed with sometimes tense exchanges behind the scenes involving the creative personnel (in this case, primarily director/choreographer Philippe Decoufle) and management (managing director Andree Deissenberg). The \"artistes\" always want more time, and the shareholders are invariably fixated on the bottom line. Which is understandable at the Crazy Horse, where dancing cheek to cheek means something very different from what Irving Berlin had in mind. (Or did he?)\n\n\n\n\n\nAt various points, the people who work there describe it as the best chic nude club in the world, and the classiest. A better description might be the kitschiest.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one routine, Decoufle's dancers enact a \"Barbarella\" number as if it were \"Solaris.\" In another, they parade around in Beefeater bearskin hats and not much else. (If the club had a uniform, it would be a thong -- though high heels and fishnets also feature strongly.) The music is mostly a cheesy mix of classic bump-and-grind and '70s Italian sex comedy. Once or twice, the choreography does break the mold -- to push into the exploratory eroticism of modern interpretative dance -- but at heart, the sensuality celebrated here is as safe and conventional as a Playboy bunny.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Wiseman disagree? Of course he never says so, but the film is laced with enough subtly suggestive ironies to prick all that oh-so-French pomposity and pretension, without ever undermining the discipline and commitment of dancers and choreographers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Be pretty, classy, relaxed -- and calm -- and push your buttocks out,\" recommends a stage manager to a group of new girls before their audition. \"American Idol\" this ain't.\n\n\n\n\n\nWiseman may be the one documentarian on Earth uninterested in revealing who makes the cut. Still, it's clear this is excellent advice; maybe all you need to know to get by in Le Crazy. Brightly photographed in high definition, the movie is an eyeful all right, but at 134 minutes, it's also a rather lengthy tease.",

Zuniga, wearing blue jeans and a gray sweater, raised her handcuffed wrists to cover her face in a police picture.\n\nZuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity.\n\nIn July, she won the title Nuestra Belleza Sinaloa. That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Nuestra Belleza Mexico in Monterrey, where she won \"The Election of the Queens,\" one of five special recognitions, and came in third overall.\n\nIn October, she won the title \"Hispanoamerican Queen 2008\" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.\n\nAccording to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site, she is to represent Mexico in next year's Miss International contest.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Sean Kingston was talking about his hit song \"Fire Burning\" when his cell phone suddenly started to ring. The device blasted a familiar tune.\n\n\n\nSean Kingston has one of the summer's hottest hits with \"Fire Burning.\"\n\n\n\nShe's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor.\n\n\n\nWait a minute. His own song is his ringtone?\n\n\n\n\"I've got to support it, man,\" said Kingston, 19, with a cheeky smile. \"It goes right back in my pocket, but hey.\"\n\n\n\nThere had better be plenty of room in those pockets. \"Fire Burning\" is shaping up to be one of the summer's hottest tracks, with more than a million downloads sold, and is the second best-selling song on iTunes this week. For mainstream radio listeners and nightclub goers, the reggae-trance track is inescapable.\n\n\n\nEven for Kingston.  Watch how Kingston sets the dance floor ablaze \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Three days ago I was in an elevator,\" he said. \"A lady came in and she had her iPod and she was playing my song. She didn't know who she was standing next to. That was kind of funny.\"\n\n\n\nBut hearing his music in public doesn't mean he's allowed to get too cocky, he said.\n\n\n\n\"It actually motivates me to make even more music, because that's kind of big. Coming from where I'm from -- coming from nothing -- it's just amazing to hear people react to my music like they do.\"\n\n\n\nThe Miami-born artist, whose real name is Kisean Anderson -- he changed his name to Kingston to reflect his Jamaican heritage -- got a taste for the big time in 2007 when his debut song \"Beautiful Girls\" became a No. 1 hit in the United States.\n\n\n\nHis sophomore album, called \"Tomorrow,\" comes out September 22. Kingston just wrapped filming in Los Angeles for the music video for its second single, \"Face Drop.\"\n\n\n\nKingston dropped by CNN to share his thoughts on his abilities on the dance floor and the leading ladies of pop. The following is an edited version of the interview.\n\n\n\nCNN: How much time do you actually spend on the dance floor?\n\n\n\nSean Kingston: I spend a lot of time on the dance floor, [though] ... I'm more the type of dude to sit back and pose and act cool. But I had to make a song for it because there's a lot of stuff that's going on in the world today ... people want to dance. People want to let loose and \"Fire Burning\" is a song that you can do that to.\n\n\n\nCNN: You were born in Miami. You grew up in Kingston. Then you moved to L.A. Where do you feel most at home?\n\n\n\nSean Kingston: I feel really at home, I can't even lie, in Miami. Because it's just like I know a lot of people, my friends that are there. That's where I started doing music when I was in Miami.\n\n\n\nCNN: Why call your sophomore album \"Tomorrow\"?\n\n\n\nKingston: Because I feel like it's so futuristic. I felt like my last album was yesterday. Nobody's going to be able to expect what Sean Kingston is bringing on this new album.\n\n\n\nCNN: The first track that came off the new album was a collaboration with Lil' Wayne. It didn't take off like your previous hits. Why do you think that is?\n\n\n\nKingston: We never sent it to radio. That record got leaked. It got leaked from the Internet and we just kept it going. But it never really got that push from the label.\n\n\n\nBut I mean it did good. I mean 4 million plays on YouTube, 3 million on MySpace. Sometimes you've got to give free music to get people to pay attention and to build a buzz. So I basically gave my fans free music.\n\n\n\nCNN: You collaborate with punk-pop band Good Charlotte on the album.\n\n\n\nKingston: Yeah. Benji and Joel [Madden], man! Those guys are hilarious. They're talented and geniuses. ...\n\n\n\nThe whole \"Tomorrow\" album ... it's ridiculous. I feel like it's going to be the album of the year. I feel like it's my best album that I ever made. It's way better than the first one.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you feel like you've pioneered this new sound that combines reggae and hip-hop and other elements?\n\n\n\nKingston: I definitely think that's my own style. I definitely think I came in the game and I got my own blend. I've got something that I call hip-pop, not hip-hop. And a lot of people are starting to use that now but I feel like it was my fusion.\n\n\n\nCNN: Is it fair to say that \"Beautiful Girls\" brought massive change to your life?\n\n\n\nKingston: It did. It changed my life like that! No other song did it but that song. I'm blessed.\n\n\n\nCNN: Are you surprised that it only takes one hit song to make someone a huge star?\n\n\n\nKingston: It didn't really quite take me one. It took me one to get in the door. And then it took having a Top Five record. But you've got to understand ... in this music business, there are so many one-hit wonders. You could have a hit, but it's like \"OK, could you follow up?\" So it's not about what your past is, it's about longevity.\n\n\n\nCNN: You've been the opening act for Gwen Stefani and Beyonce. Who are some other female musicians you admire?\n\n\n\nKingston: Man, those two are amazing. Gwen Stefani! That's what you call a star right there. Just to be in her presence ... I learned a lot from her. She's just amazing. Beyonce too. I like Mary J. Blige. Rhianna! I met her a lot of times and she's down to earth. She's so cool. And she's an island girl. And I'm an island dude, and we gotta hold down for other people.",

  "context": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Thursday in a parking lot at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, sparking a massive fire, but \"luckily,\" no one was nearby and there were no deaths, Spain's interior minister said.\n\n\"There could have been an enormous tragedy today at the University of Navarra,\" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said hours after the attack in a televised address.\n\nHospital officials told CNN that 27 people suffered minor injuries, including one American woman and five other non-Spaniards. The Basque separatist group ETA is suspected to be behind the attack.\n\nThe car, packed with an unknown quantity of explosives, was parked in a lot near the university's library and detonated shortly after 11 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET), Rubalcaba said.  Watch witness describe the blast \u00c2\u00bb\n\nCampus authorities shut down the entire campus shortly after the blast to search for a possible second explosive device near the science building, about a half kilometer (.3 mile) from the car bombing, according to CNN's partner station in Spain, CNN+.  Watch report on Pamplona car bomb \u00c2\u00bb\n\nNo device was found and the search was called off Thursday afternoon, according to a university spokesman and a representative for the national government's main office in Navarra. Most of the campus was reopened; only the area surrounding the bomb blast remained cordoned off, they said.\n\nClasses are expected to resume as scheduled on Friday, the university spokesman said.\n\nThe car bomb sparked a massive fire in the campus' Central Building, where about 400 students and staff were located at the time, university spokesman Jesus Diaz told CNN+. Video from the scene showed fire engulfing part of the building and thick clouds of black smoke billowing over the campus.\n\nAuthorities in Spain's Basque province of Alava received a warning call at 9:50 a.m. in the name of ETA.  Watch aftermath of the blast \u00c2\u00bb\n\nThe warning call to the DYA emergency services in Alava said the car bomb would strike a university campus in the city of Vitoria about an hour after the phone call, prompting emergency officials to search that campus and determine that the call was merely a false alarm, Rubalcaba said.\n\n\"So whoever planted the bomb either gave an intentionally misleading warning call or they made a mistake,\" he said in his televised address.\n\nAccording to CNN+, the University of Navarra has been targeted by ETA six times in the past 30 years, and one faculty member said it is unclear why.\n\n\"It is not a political university,\" Professor Maria Teresa La Porte told CNN. \"We don't understand.\"\n\n\"If they are looking for innocent victims, the place to find them is here,\" she said. \"There is no way to stop them.\"\n\nShe said it is an open campus with students from various backgrounds -- including Basque -- where people \"can come here completely freely.\"\n\nThe blast could be heard across the campus of the private school, which has 12,000 students -- including more than 1,000 scholars from countries outside Spain. It is also home to Spain's top-rated journalism school, which is located not too far from the blast site.\n\nA spokeswoman for Clinica Universitaria de Navarra -- located across the street from the university -- said that 24 patients were treated for injuries ranging from glass cuts to hearing problems. Most have been released and only two are expected to remain overnight, she said.\n\nTwo other patients are being treated at Hospital Virgen del Camino, also in Pamplona, but their nationalities were not clear.\n\nThose being treated at Clinica Universitaria de Navarra included 18 Spaniards and six others with the following nationalities: American woman from California, age 20; Italian woman, age 28; Portuguese woman, age 23; Chilean woman, age 25; Peruvian man, age 28 and Philippines man, age 34.\n\nThursday's explosion came just days after Spanish police arrested four suspected ETA members early Tuesday. Authorities accused them of forming a terrorist cell that was ready to attack, the Spanish Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThree of the suspects were arrested in or near the city of Pamplona, in Spain's northern Navarra region, which has Basque roots and was to be the base for the alleged cell, the statement said.\n\nThe fourth suspect was arrested in the city of Valencia, on Spain's eastern coast.\n\nPolice seized two revolvers and ammunition; various timers that might be used for bombs; detonating cord; items that might be used to make a bomb attached to the underside of vehicles; various substances that might be used to make explosives; and computer documentation, the ministry said.\n\nAll four suspects -- three men and a woman -- were born in Pamplona and range in age from 26 to 29, the ministry said.\n\nETA is blamed for more than 800 killings in its four-decade-long fight for Basque independence. The European Union and the United States list ETA as a terrorist group.\n\nCNN Madrid Correspondent Al Goodman contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama's decision on the future of the eight-year-old war, a defense official said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nObama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\n\nA Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president's decision. But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving, the official said.\n\n\n\nObama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001.\n\n\n\nThe president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested.\n\n\n\nMcChrystal was among those who took part in Monday's conference with Obama and other top advisers, which broke up at 10 p.m.\n\n\n\nVice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, were among the other senior officials in the meeting.\n\n\n\nObama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been \"comprehensive and extremely useful.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there, you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\n\n\n\nThe military has planning under way to send these units: three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations.\n\n\n\nCNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon.\n\n\n\nThe troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place.\n\n\n\nCurrently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy.\n\n\n\nAbout 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance.\n\n\n\nTwo U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\n\nPentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help.\n\n\n\n\"Clearly, if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan, there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces,\" Morrell said.\n\n\n\nU.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught.\n\n\n\nTaliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other.\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region.\n\n\n\nThe conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.\n\n\n\nA CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan. Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision, with 49 percent opposed.\n\n\n\nThe poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly, up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March. Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent, with 52 percent opposed.\n\n\n\niReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan\n\n\n\nAfghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday. Singh said the international community needs \"to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan, to help it emerge as a modern state.\"\n\n\n\n\"The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated,\" he said. \"President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism.\"\n\n\n\nIndia is one Afghanistan's biggest international donors, contributing $1.2 billion in aid. That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan, India's nuclear rival in South Asia. But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support.\n\n\n\nIn addition, several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades-old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders, giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier.\n\n\n\n\"I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week,\" Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official, said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly \"on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups.\"\n\n\n\n\"The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India, but we can quietly, behind the scenes, push them to reduce their problems,\" Burns said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.",

  "context": "New York (CNN) -- Investigators suspect arson in a fire that killed five Guatemalan immigrants in Brooklyn, they said Monday.\n\n\n\n\"People are all concerned and very sad,\" said Maria Luz de Zyriek, the Guatemalan consul in New York. \"This is a horrible tragedy.\"\n\n\n\nAuthorities continue to investigate and have not formally determined a cause, the Fire Department of New York said. The blaze damaged a restaurant and apartments in a three-story building in the Bensonhurst neighborhood, Frank Dwyer, a fire department spokesman, has said.\n\n\n\nLuisa Chan, a mother of two, died in the blaze, said Mario Alvarado, a member of Jovenes Cristianos -- Christian Youth, a church with about 200 members, most of them Guatemalan immigrants, on 17th Avenue in Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nChan usually attended services on Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, Alvarado said. The congregation mourned her on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"The service was so quiet,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAre you there? Share your story\n\n\n\nInvestigators have not publicly identified the victims, but the Guatemalan consul said they were all from the western part of the country. Two were from the state of Totonicapan and three were from the state of Quetzaltenango, she said.\n\n\n\nAfter the fire broke out, Chan managed to get her 2-year-old son to safety, apparently by handing him to someone on the floor below, and threw her 2-month-old daughter toward a passerby, said Alvarado, who said he received that account from someone close to the family.\n\n\n\n\"Thank God they're safe,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA 2-month-old baby was in critical condition, fire officials said, but the child was not immediately identified; three other people sustained injuries ranging from serious to minor.\n\n\n\nThirteen firefighters sustained minor injuries.\n\n\n\nThe fire started about 2:30 a.m. Saturday behind a door in one of the apartment units, Dwyer said.\n\n\n\n\"If somebody starts a fire there intentionally, that would certainly be looking to kill somebody, because there's no way for them to get out,\" Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said.\n\n\n\nAt Chan's church, members in mourning were waiting Monday for more information from authorities, Alvarado said. They also were getting ready for a memorial service and trying to comfort Chan's husband, who survived the fire, the consul said.\n\n\n\n\"The husband and wife belonged to that church. Everybody there knew them,\" said Luz, who went to the church during the weekend.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody there was so sad. Everybody was crying and praying for the husband,\" she said. \"He's going to have to raise those two little kids now by himself.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Miguel Susana contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- To the litany of challenges that confront India's path to a better life, we can now add subdued economic growth as a result of the global financial crisis.\n\n\n\nA banana vendor stands on a flooded street as he waits for customers in Amritsar, India, on August 13.\n\n\n\nAfter three spectacular years of 9 percent-plus annual growth, India will reach just 6.3 percent next year, according to the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund in early November. The Reserve Bank of India is forecasting a more optimistic 7.5 to 8 percent.\n\n\n\nWhile 7.5 percent may still sound a good result, it is barely enough for the economy to keep pace with the 10 million-plus young people who will join the Indian job market in 2009.\n\n\n\nIndia's major shortcomings in infrastructure, education, health care and environmental protection are well known, as are the constant problems of corruption, poor governance, rural poverty, communalism, domestic terrorism, child labor, discrimination against women and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes.\n\n\n\nBut at least in recent years India could point to a strong economy as the platform on which it was making its push for higher living standards, social modernization and economic reform. Since May 2004, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram took on the reins of government, India's economy has had a charmed run.\n\n\n\nStrong growth in business sectors such asinformation technology, pharmaceuticals, automotive, financial services and retail have coincided with a better performing agricultural sector, and a housing and consumption boom driven by easier credit.\n\n\n\nIndia's young working men and women -- more than half the country's 1.15 billion people are aged 25 or less -- have shown a much greater propensity to spend, compared to their thrifty, risk-averse parents and grandparents.\n\n\n\nThis willingness to go into debt rather than save has seen a massive rise in sales of consumer goods such as mobile phones, flat screen TVs, refrigerators, household utensils, motorcycles and cars. The same goes for spending on services, from tourism to healthcare to self-improvement.\n\n\n\nNow the halcyon days appear to be over, as the international credit crunch flattens demand everywhere. Already the downturn is seeing job losses in sectors such as aviation, financial services, retailing and export industries, as companies tighten their belts and put expansion plans on hold.\n\n\n\nThe government admits things will get tougher, with Singh telling the nation on October 20 that \"we must be prepared for a temporary slowdown in the Indian economy.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier that day, the Reserve Bank of India cut its key repurchase (short-term lending) rate by 100 basis points to 8 percent, saying it needed to ease the pressure on India's credit markets and maintain financial stability. It followed that with another cut to 7.5 percent on November 1.\n\n\n\nRBI Governor Dr. D. Subbarao noted the global downturn could be deeper and the recovery might take longer than earlier expected. \"Consequently, the adverse implications through trade and financial channels for emerging economies, including India, have amplified,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEconomists and analysts have welcomed the central bank's moves, which have included a 350-basis point reduction in the cash reserve ratio -- the amount of money Indian banks must keep on hand -- between July and November.\n\n\n\nTushar Poddar, head of Asian economic research at investment bank Goldman Sachs, said the RBI's October 20 action was \"well ahead of market expectations\" and showed a bias towards growth and financial stability, against inflation.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs had earlier cut its growth outlook for the 2009-10FY to 7 percent and has warned the figure could go lower if the international financial turmoil continues over the next few months.\n\n\n\nBut Poddar believes that India's export drive -- which has seen exports triple since 2003 to about $163 billion in 2007-08FY -- may not suffer too greatly.\n\n\n\nIn a recent study, he found that about two-thirds of India's exports go outside the United States and the European Union (the two trade areas most affected by the downturn) to China, Southeast Asia, West Asia and Africa. While Indian exports would slow, \"the downside is limited,\" he said. A lower Indian rupee would also help.\n\n\n\nForeign investment is slowing in line with the downturn. Morgan Stanley's India economist Chetan Ahya noted recently that \"adverse global circumstances\" are weighing on India's ability to attract overseas money. Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the global credit markets, Ahya believes capital inflows could slow to $40-50 billion in the year ahead, compared with $110 billion in 2008.\n\n\n\nOn the broader political front, India has to deal with a range of internal and external risks that include domestic communalism-cum-terrorism and the constant threat of conflict with Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir territory.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka all add to a difficult neighborhood, while India's relations with China are cool at best, even as trade ties grow. Territorial disputes linger from the 1962 border war between the two.\n\n\n\nThat helps explain why India was named recently by Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) as the Asia-Pacific country with the highest political and social risk for 2009.\n\n\n\nA report by PERC in late October assessed 16 countries in the Asia Pacific region, and assigned India the highest risk rating of 6.87, ahead of Thailand with 6.28. China was seventh with 5.33, behind Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia.\n\n\n\nPERC cited uncertainties surrounding India's coming general election -- due to be held by May 2009 -- along with rising communal violence and incidents of terrorism.\n\n\n\n\"The biggest risk is that a deterioration in political and economic conditions in neighboring Pakistan could aggravate social unrest in India further, and hurt national security,\" it noted.\n\n\n\nBut it said India's underlying attractions to foreign investors should remain, \"no matter who wins the next election.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Singh, with six months of his government to run, is putting on a brave face. \"It is when India is challenged that the Indian people rise to the occasion and convert the challenge into an opportunity. There is no place for fear,\" he told the nation late last month.\n\n\n\nGeoff Hiscock writes on Indian business and is the author of \"India's Global Wealth Club\" (2007) and \"India's Store Wars\" (2008), both published by John Wiley & Sons.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York nightclub hostess identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods' mistress has called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview published Tuesday, Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that \"not a word of it is true.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I work in clubs, and I am a businesswoman,\" Uchitel said. \"I do not have sex with celebrities, and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators. He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing \"the many false, unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me.\" Opinion: Woods is only human\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related.\n\n\n\n\n\nUchitel said she has met Woods twice, once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's my job: to know these people, to have a relationship with them, to hang out with them,\" she told the Post. \"It doesn't mean I am having sex with them or an affair with them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the allegations \"must feel horrible\" to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The worst part of it, it's not true,\" Uchitel said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The U.N. Council for Human Rights began debate Thursday over whether to adopt the recommendations of a controversial U.N. report examining the three-week winter war between Israel and the militant group Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\n\nAn Israeli soldier sits on a tank on the Israel-Gaza border just before fighting began in December 2008.\n\n\n\nThe report, based on a fact-finding mission led by former South African jurist Richard Goldstone, was released last month and concluded that Israel and Hamas had both committed \"actions amounting to war crimes, possibly crimes against humanity.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the start of the meeting, Israeli Ambassador Aharon Leshno Yaar blasted the United Nations for even holding the special session. Yaar said it \"had nothing to do with human rights and everything to do with Palestinian politics.\"\n\n\n\nHe said adoption of the \"biased\" recommendations of the Goldstone report, which calls for further action by the General Assembly and Security Council if both sides do not conduct credible investigations, would constitute a \"reward for terror\" that \"will set back hopes for peace in the region.\"\n\n\n\nPreviously, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Palestinian Authority that pushing action on the Goldstone report would deal \"a mortal blow\" to the peace process.\n\n\n\nThe council received the report September 29 but took no action, after a request by the Palestinian Authority to defer discussion for six months.\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian Authority government of Mahmoud Abbas came under withering domestic criticism for the move and was accused of succumbing to Israeli and American pressure to drop the issue.\n\n\n\nAbbas reversed course Sunday and in a televised address told Palestinians that he was seeking immediate debate within the Human Rights Council and vowed to work \"to punish everyone who was responsible for the hideous crimes committed against our children, our men and women -- especially in our dear Gaza.\"\n\n\n\nIbrahim Khraishi, the Palestinian Authority's U.N. ambassador in Geneva, said Israel had rebuffed the Palestinian Authority's conciliatory move to defer debate on the report and instead had answered \"with even more grave violations of the rights of Palestinians\" in the form of restrictions of movement and housing demolitions in East Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nThe 47-member Human Rights Council is expected to vote on the resolution on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe draft resolution goes beyond the Gaza conflict. It \"strongly condemns\" measures taken by Israel limiting Palestinians' access to their properties and holy sites \"on the basis of national origin, religion, sex, age or any other discriminatory ground.\"\n\n\n\nIt further condemns \"Israeli violations of human rights in Occupied East Jerusalem, particularly the confiscation of lands and properties, the demolishing of houses and private properties, the construction and expansion of settlements, the continuous construction of the separation wall, changing the demographic and geographic character of East Jerusalem, the restrictions on the freedom of movement of the Palestinian citizens of East Jerusalem, as well as the continuous digging and excavation works in and around Al-Aqsa mosque and its vicinity.\"\n\n\n\nThere is an ongoing dispute about the number of people killed in the three-week military offensive that Israel called Operation Cast Lead, which began December 27 and ended January 18.\n\n\n\nThe Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights put the death toll at 1,419 and said 1,167 of those were non-combatants. The Israeli military released its own figures earlier this year, saying that 1,166 people were killed, 60 percent of whom were \"terror operatives.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Scotland's Susan Boyle gives new meaning to the term \"overnight sensation.\" The \"Britain's Got Talent\" contestant was expected to be something of a joke when she first sauntered on stage, but she absolutely wowed the audience, the judges -- and then the world via the Internet -- with her stunning rendition of \"I Dreamed a Dream.\"\n\n\n\nAlong with Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan, Amanda Holden is a judge on \"Britain's Got Talent.\"\n\n\n\nBut like others who stumble upon sudden fame, she found the pressure and scrutiny to be overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\"Talent\" judge Amanda Holden and Dr. Drew Pinsky of VH1's \"Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew\" joined CNN's Larry King Tuesday night to discuss Boyle's hospitalization for stress and the toll the spotlight and media criticism might have taken on her mental health. They also discussed whether Boyle will develop the emotional stamina for a high-pressure singing career.\n\n\n\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\n\n\nLarry King: What do we know right now?\n\n\n\nAmanda Holden: Basically, we've spoken to Susan's brother. He, in fact, spoke on [CBS' \"The Early Show\"] this morning to say that his sister was very keen to come home as soon as she possibly could and that she was resting up in a clinic in London and that she was very much looking forward to coming out and seeing what was available to her when she felt better.\n\n\n\nKing: Is the show, Amanda, paying for the hospital bills and are they taking care of her?\n\n\n\nHolden: I have no idea if they're paying the hospital bills. I would imagine that they are. We're a very loyal show. We love Susan very much. In fact, all the contestants that appear on our show are extraordinarily well looked after.\n\n\n\nKing: Your fellow judge, Piers Morgan, has said that there was talk of taking her off the show because of all the pressures on her. Were you involved? Were there any discussions like that?\n\n\n\nHolden: I wasn't involved in any discussions like that. And I think Piers has a slightly closer relationship with her.  ... The only thing I'm worried about with Susan Boyle is that she seems to have a crush on Piers Morgan. ...\n\n\n\nI think that Piers kind of reassured her during the final that she was doing well and that she mustn't pay any kind of attention to the press and all the other stuff that was going\n\n\n\nKing: Despite all the tumult, there's no disputing that Susan sang her heart out during the finale of the competition. I know the dance troupe [Diversity] was terrific. But, frankly, why didn't she win?\n\n\n\nHolden: Honestly, I can't criticize the decision because it was the British public that voted in the end. I have no real idea, to be honest. I wonder whether it could be that Diversity was utterly fantastic on the show that night. They decimated the show. They really, really were amazing. And I just wonder whether maybe younger people voted and were quicker on the texts than the kind of people that were voting for Susan.\n\n\n\nBut as I keep saying, if Susan is a loser, then surely she is the biggest and best loser that we have in the world. And coming second is no bad thing.  Watch Amanda Holden discuss Susan Boyle \u00bb\n\n\n\nKing: She came in, though, [as] a small-town amateur singer, [with] learning disabilities due to suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. Some say the program exploited her and her vulnerabilities. Do you agree?\n\n\n\nHolden: I couldn't disagree more. You know, she's a grown woman who applied to come on a talent show. She enjoyed every second of every moment that I met her or saw her behind the scenes. She was very excited. She was very proud to be taking part in the show.\n\n\n\nI think the downturn in press in our country [Britain], I think, maybe stressed her out a little bit. And I think she was just quite upset about all the exaggerated stories and the kind of falsehoods that were being written about her. I think that everybody gets upset about bad press when you're in this business. And she's somebody that's gone from anonymity to [an] absolute worldwide phenomenon.\n\n\n\nKing: Yes.\n\n\n\nHolden: So how is she expected to handle that? Nobody can handle that with the best will in the world. I've been in the business 15 years, and I'm still not media savvy.\n\n\n\n[Dr. Drew Pinsky joins the show]\n\n\n\nKing: What do you make of this Susan Boyle thing?\n\n\n\nPinsky: The problem here is that here's a woman that's suddenly under the scrutiny of the spotlight who maybe has some  developmental issues, who is under tremendous stress and [now] is in a psychiatric hospital. The question is, did the show harm her?\n\n\n\nKing: Did it?\n\n\n\nPinsky: It's hard to say. This is the first time these kind of experiences have really been undertaken by people. People that come out of nowhere all of a sudden are international superstars.\n\n\n\nKing: Should we be, Amanda, concerned about that?\n\n\n\nHolden: First of all, I just want to say that Susan's brother said on British television this morning that, yes, Susan has experienced learning difficulties. But in actual fact, when she was at school, she did as well as any of her other siblings. But throughout her childhood, always before an exam or anything else, she always got quite anxious.\n\n\n\n[Before the show], she was feeling nervous. But she went out there and she nailed it. You know, she did the best performance that we've seen. And let's not forget, this is actually only the second or third time we've heard her sing. ...\n\n\n\nShe is in a place where celebrities go when they are burnt out. Now, I am obviously not a doctor. I have no factual information to give to you. I can only say to you her brother ... has said she wants to come home within a matter of days, rather than weeks.\n\n\n\nPinsky: That's excellent.\n\n\n\nKing: Would you guess, Dr. Drew, that she still has a career in front of her? Wouldn't you bet she does?\n\n\n\nPinsky: Oh, I bet she does, absolutely. And she will learn to become accustomed to this kind of stress, I am sure. But let's make sure she has the care she needs.\n\n\n\nAnd let's be sure that ... everybody that goes on shows like this has access to things that help them deal with the stress of these kinds of environments.",

It was not clear whether the person was a man or woman, but the next of kin had been informed, the Foreign Office said.\n\n\n\nA 53-year-old French man was killed Thursday when a crane collapsed at the venue, a fire department spokesman in the southern French city said.\n\n\n\nA third person was in critical condition, said Alexandre Lanzalavi, a spokesman for Marseille Hospital. Two other people were in hospital and required surgery, and seven others were treated and released, Lanzalavi said.\n\n\n\nMadonna said Thursday that she was \"devastated\" to hear about the death.\n\n\n\n\"My prayers go out to those who were injured and their families, along with my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this heartbreaking news,\" Madonna said in a statement issued by her representative, Liz Rosenberg.\n\n\n\nAt least one Madonna show had been canceled, Rosenberg told CNN.\n\n\n\nThe accident happened when a crane collapsed while lifting a large metallic truss -- a structure from which lights hang -- into place, Lt. Thierry Delorme of the French Navy told CNN. In Marseille, the fire department is a part of the Navy.\n\n\n\nAn investigation has been launched into the cause of the collapse, he said.\n\n\n\nSome 27 fire engines and 80 firefighters responded to the emergency when the accident occurred about 5:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. ET).\n\n\n\nMadonna was to play the first of five concerts for her \"Sticky and Sweet\" tour at the 60,000-seat Stade Velodrome on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe singer was in Udine, Italy, when she heard the news, Rosenberg said.\n\n\n\nFlora Genoux in Paris, France, contributed to this story for CNN.",

  "context": "(EW.com) -- The last time we saw him on our TV sets, T. R. Knight was playing \"Grey's Anatomy\"'s beloved Dr. George O'Malley before he met an untimely end in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his first television role since (he's been continuing a successful stage career), Knight plays somewhat against type: George O'Malley was the bumbling, baby-faced surgeon with a nervous smile and horrible luck with women; his latest character, Gabriel Thomas from last night's \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" is an alleged (SPOILER ALERT!) \"power-reassurance serial rapist\" with a neck tattoo -- sure, the tat is of a yin-yang symbol -- but still, a neck tattoo pretty much never screams \"nice guy.\" Gabriel sure looks like George, but that's where the similarities end. Like George, Gabriel's into blonds, but only of the submissive variety -- that would certainly exclude Izzie Stevens.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's rather inspired to cast an actor so associated with a recognizably benevolent character in such a disturbing role (sort of the effect Elijah Wood had as the expressionless, evil Kevin in \"Sin City\"). Seeing Knight go from a bright-eyed family man one moment to a sinister predator who snarls, \"Tell me you love me, Mommy\" to the women he's assaulting (ick) in the next is appropriately chilling. And, as it turns out, the dichotomy makes even more sense as, in a twist typical of this long-in-the-tooth series, Knight is pulling a Sarah Michelle Gellar and playing estranged identical twins, one of whom has a seemingly charmed life whereas the other's is in serious shambles.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be a long shot, but for fans, his appearance on \"Law & Order\" might be a sign of more T. R. to come. In the enduring spirit of cross-promotion, NBC seems to use \"SVU\" as a testing ground for future series leads.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful relationships between NBC and stars often begin in that famous interrogation room. Just look at Hayden Panettiere's two roles ramping up to Heroes, and Maria Bello's significant role last season en route to Prime Suspect (which really is getting better -- save that show!). Even though Knight's return to TV was welcome in my eyes, I found his performance weirdly unsatisfying. He didn't get to sink his teeth into his role(s) as much as I'd hoped because a lot of the episode was devoted to initiating new detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish); plus, his characters' Southern accent sounded a bit inconsistent -- anyone else notice that?\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the full article at EW.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Commentators who have watched the conflict in Northern Ireland play out for decades call the peace process a miracle.\n\n\n\nVarious leaders negotiated for years to bring an end to Northern Ireland's \"troubles.\"\n\n\n\nCulminating in a power sharing deal between Ulster's unionists, led by Ian Paisley, and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA (nationalists), led by Gerry Adams, the road to peace has been a torturous one characterized by violence, set-backs and numerous false starts.\n\n\n\nOnly recently the Ulster Defence Association, Northern Ireland's largest loyalist group, said it will cease to be an armed paramilitary group, starting at midnight on November 11, saying the \"war is over.\"\n\n\n\n\"All weaponry will be put beyond use,\" Colin Halliday of the Ulster Political Research Group, which is linked to the group, said in a speech in Belfast aired by RTE, Ireland's state-owned broadcaster. \"The struggle to maintain the union is on a new and more complex battlefield.\"\n\n\n\nThe Irish Republican Army (IRA) disarmed two years ago, helping to restore the province's government in Belfast.\n\n\n\nIrish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the most recent moves of groups to disarm was \"significant and hopefully signals a further step toward the ending of all paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.\"\n\n\n\nFor those that have lived through the turmoil in Northern Ireland, peace achieved though diplomacy must have seemed like an unrealistic goal. After all, each attack by loyalists usually resulted in retaliation by nationalists -- making the dispute bitter and intractable.\n\n\n\nBut diplomacy has worked in bringing peace to Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nCredit for developing a framework for the peace process stretches back to former British Prime Minster John Major's rule in the 1990s and efforts by Ireland's Ahern. But it was Major's successor, Tony Blair, who was unrelenting in his quest for peace by making it a major priority of his government.\n\n\n\nBlair came to Northern Ireland 37 times as Prime Minister, traveling there more often than any of his predecessors as well as hosting many meetings at 10 Downing Street and discussing the peace process while at many international summits.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Belfast Telegraph: \"When he (Blair) said on that first day he had come to seek 'a lasting and fair political settlement' it turned out he wasn't spouting platitudes on a stump.\"\n\n\n\nJournalist James Button, who covered the peace process talks, says: \"Blair played a clever hand. He saw the hardliners had to be involved.\n\n\n\n\"Critically he judged that the process had to tilt ever so slightly towards the republicans to prevent a split in their ranks and the resumption of violence by radicals -- which had happened whenever the republican leadership had inclined to moderation before.\"\n\n\n\nButton says Downing Street had a bicycle theory around peace talks: \"They had to keep going forward otherwise they would fall over.\"\n\n\n\nIt was Blair's diplomacy that wooed the previously immovable Paisley. Irish political scientist Lord Bew told the Guardian the alliance with Paisley was Blair's \"last great romance... Once again when we thought the old maestro was fading, his capacity to seduce, politically speaking, is phenomenal.\"\n\n\n\nBut as Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein told CNN, the conflict was primarily a local one that needed to be solved by local people: \"The people who have to be the brokers are the people who live in the areas of conflict.\n\n\n\n\"They're the people who ought to be the brokers but everybody else from the outside has to enhance the conditions so that those leaders or factions can actually broker not just an agreement, but implement an agreement.\n\n\n\n\"The Good Friday Agreement -- and [former U.S.] Senator [George] Mitchell said this at the time, when we got the agreement -- \"That's the easy bit. Implementing it is going to be the difficult bit.\"\n\n\n\nMitchell worked with the various participants to reach an agreement.\n\n\n\nThe long road to peace\n\n\n\nThe \"troubles\" have been a centuries-old dispute between England and Ireland over who controls Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nIn 1609 British colonial settlers confiscated native-owned land in Northern Ireland and settled in Ulster with mainly Protestant British planters. There was conflict between the planters and the native Irish. The planters won the bloody ethno-religious conflicts that followed and cracked down on the political and religious freedoms of the indigenous Irish.\n\n\n\nIn the 1700s groups formed (including the Ulster Orangemen that continue to this day) and antagonisms between the two communities became entrenched.\n\n\n\nIreland was incorporated into the UK in 1801 and reformers such as Daniel O'Connell called for the repeal of the union as well as the end of discrimination of Catholics (around 75 percent of the population).\n\n\n\nThe agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party, who sometimes held the balance of power in Westminster, led to the unionists further entrenching their position for British rule.\n\n\n\nIn 1920 guerilla warfare between what became known as the IRA and Unionists led to the partitioning of southern Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nNationalists in Northern Ireland, who numbered around 35 per cent of the population, did not accept legitimacy of the new partition.\n\n\n\nBetween 1970 and 1972 tensions that had been brewing erupted into violence with almost 500 people killed in Northern Ireland. One explanation for this was the formation of the real IRA, which embraced \"armed struggle\" against British rule.\n\n\n\nAnother was the introduction of internment without trial (the vast majority of those imprisoned were Catholic) which succeed in politicizing many into the nationalist cause.\n\n\n\nBloody Sunday -- a January 1972 shooting in Derry of 14 unarmed nationalist civil rights activists by the British Army -- was a flashpoint in the conflict.\n\n\n\nIn 1972 the retaliation of the Provos came at a massive cost -- more than 100 soldiers were killed, 500 were wounded and there were 1300 bombings.\n\n\n\nYet the nationalists vowed to continue their campaign until there was a united Ireland.\n\n\n\nSuccessive British governments failed to solve the \"Irish question\" so the participants settled in for what the IRA called the Long War, which involved sustained, low-level violence, hunger strikes and protests.\n\n\n\nThe stop-start cease-fire\n\n\n\nSince the late 1980s Sinn Fein, which compared its struggle to that of the fight for liberation in Palestine and South Africa, has sought a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\n\n\nBoth loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared a cease-fire after much negotiation. But the peace was fragile and short-lived.\n\n\n\nThe IRA, led by Adams, revoked the cease-fire in 1996 after a bombing at Canary Wharf in London that killed two and caused \u00a385 million worth of damage.\n\n\n\nIn June 1996 a large part of Manchester's city center was destroyed by an IRA bomb that injured 200 people.\n\n\n\nSplinter groups of the IRA who rejected the notion of a cease-fire continued their campaigns. In August 1998 the Real IRA bombed Omagh, killing 29 civilians.\n\n\n\nBut during the 1990s many world leaders still held out for peace in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nSupporters of talks included the president of the U.S., Bill Clinton, who in 1995 visited Northern Ireland and spoke in Belfast of the \"peace process,\" calling terrorists \"yesterday's men.\"\n\n\n\nDiplomacy in action\n\n\n\nIn 1997 newly elected British Prime Minister Tony Blair endorsed a report on decommissioning and the criteria for inclusion in all-party talks. Mo Mowlam, the UK's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, accepted in August 1997 that the IRA cease-fire was genuine and invited Sinn Fein for multi-party talks.\n\n\n\nOn Good Friday, April 10 1998, it was announced that the two governments and political parties in Northern Ireland had reached an agreement to share power. It later emerged that President Clinton had made a number of calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach an agreement.\n\n\n\nThe agreement included a devolved, inclusive government, prisoner release, troop reduction, paramilitary decommissioning, and the addressing of the question of Irish reunification.\n\n\n\nThe definitive end of the peace process -- and the Troubles - came in 2007 following the St Andrews agreement in October 2006 and the March 2007 elections. The Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein formed a government in May 2007 and in July 2007 the British Army formally ended their mission in Northern Ireland, 38 years after their deployment.\n\n\n\nToday, Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom but the British government has said if there is a majority of votes then a united Ireland will be possible.\n\n\n\nThe key to winning support from the Nationalists/ Republicans was the British Government recognizing the \"Irish Dimension\" -- that the Irish as a whole should have the right to work out the issues between the North and the South, without outside interference.\n\n\n\nProsperity and peace\n\n\n\nAccording to an article in the Financial Times, former sectarians have been tamed not only by peace but also by prosperity.\n\n\n\n\"The little brick houses which rose 56 percent in price in the last year cost more than the English average. There are Japanese restaurants. The locals fly from George Best Airport to their Alpine second homes. These people are, in the local phase, 'recovering sectarians,'\" according to the FT.\n\n\n\nAiding this process is the European Union, which is flooding Northern Ireland with funds, believing that the peace and diplomatic process needs to be financially assisted.\n\n\n\nThe European Union's investment, worth 724 million euros (about 1.03 billion U.S. dollars) will be made available through the three programs -- the PEACE III program, the cross-border cooperation program with Ireland and Scotland, and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment program for the province.\n\n\n\nBut peace and prosperity would not have occurred without the success of diplomacy, says Adams. \"There's been a war somewhere in the world for every day of every week of every month of the last few decades and all of them are caused by human beings, mostly by men ... all of them can be resolved through dialogue.\" E-mail to a friend",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Shoes tell a lot about a person. If you stumbled into my closet, you would probably think I was a security guard, a construction worker or a Nurse Ratched wannabe. My taste in shoes tends to be boxy, low-heeled and sturdy.\n\n\n\nIf the equipment isn't cleaned properly, you could be at risk for infection when you get a pedicure.\n\n\n\nSo it probably doesn't surprise you to learn that when it comes to pedicures, I am hardly a nail salon enabler.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, in some sort of twisted cosmic comedy, both my teen and my tween daughters are pedicure addicts.\n\n\n\nTo pedicure addicts, there is nothing better than being seated in those massive padded massage chairs, chin deep in fashion magazines, while some woman bathes, chisels, files and paints their toes.\n\n\n\nAnd up until now, the only thing I worried about was how much the extra flower motif on her big toe was going to cost me.\n\n\n\nNow, I have plenty of other stuff to worry about.\n\n\n\nDr. Dina Tsentserensky, a podiatrist in New York, made it clear.\n\n\n\n\"I definitely see patients that have had problems as a result of getting a pedicure,\" she said. \"I guess the most common is fungal nails.\"\n\n\n\nFungal nails!!! I really don't want to pay for that.\n\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, unfortunately, describes fungal nail in less-than-clear terms: Fungal nail infection is an infection of the nails by a fungus.\n\n\n\nPrescription treatments are only about 50 percent effective, and most of these infections usually require the loss of the infected nail itself, the NIH Web site says.\n\n\n\nCuts, scrapes and some other infections are also common results of seemingly soothing foot romps. Tsentserensky thinks it's nothing new.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a chronic problem that has been going on for a while,\" she said. \"People just maybe chose to ignore it or don't pay attention as much as they should.\"\n\n\n\nAnyone who did pay attention could have known about some of those risks eight years ago. That's when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported finding a nasty infection that hit more than 100 pedicure patients. The culprit: a less-than-sterile footbath screen. The result: an infection called mycobacterium fortuitum.\n\n\n\nThat mouthful of a malady left these customers, most of them women, with prolonged boils on their lower legs and some long-term scars. Although that report prompted nail salons to clean the screens on those foot baths more often, it doesn't mean that in the land of pedicure pampering, you can just relax and enjoy the polishing.\n\n\n\nTsentserensky's chief advice is to be on high cleanliness alert.\n\n\n\n\"I tell patients to make sure that the bathtubs are being cleaned properly, that they are using enough time in between so the disinfectant has time to work,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAnd the magic timeframe, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, is about 10 minutes between clients. The EPA also stresses that to ensure the safest conditions, the tubs need to be cleaned with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant, which means the bottle itself will have a EPA registration number listed somewhere on the label.\n\n\n\nBut it's not just the tubs that need to be clean. So do those instruments.\n\n\n\n\"Make sure that instruments are getting sterilized properly,\" Tsentserensky cautions, \"that they are using a sterilizer or an autoclave to properly sanitize the instruments or using the liquids for the proper periods of time.\"\n\n\n\nTiming is also important, but that's a condition that's on your side. Don't get a pedicure right after you've shaved your legs, had laser hair removal or have any cuts or bites on your legs. Any opening in the skin is an invitation that you might not want to be extending.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, make sure you can communicate with your nail technician to ensure he or she is taking the proper precautions to make your pedicure a stress-free experience and, more important, to ensure that the only thing you're taking with you when you leave that salon is the pretty polish.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The photograph is a jarring image that shows Nazi Party members, shovels in hand, digging up graves of American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Nazi Party are forced to dig up mass graves of U.S. soldiers while American GIs look on.\n\n\n\nWhile the men dig up the site, U.S. soldiers investigating war crimes stand over them. Two crosses with helmets placed atop them -- the sign of a fallen soldier -- are visible. Two Germans are knee deep in mud. Another, with a handlebar mustache, has the look of a defeated man. The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer.\n\n\n\nOn the back of the photo is written, \"Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.\"   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for \"looking like Jews\" or \"sounding like Jews,\" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march.\n\n\n\nIt was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore \"Bud\" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team.\n\n\n\nThe photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.  See shocking photos of the slave camp \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut the image of Nazi Party members digging up graves doesn't appear to be part of that collection. Martin said he was proud to hand over the photos.\n\n\n\n\"People have to see these. This is something that's history and it belongs with something that's historical to tell that story. It doesn't belong in my closet.\"\n\n\n\n\"To be honest, I'm kind of sorry I haven't done it sooner. We didn't realize what it was.\"\n\n\n\nElmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. \"I now see where it all started,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve.\n\n\n\nThe two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets.\n\n\n\nJim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. \"He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating.\"\n\n\n\nEfraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify.\n\n\n\n\"They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis,\" he said. \"The realities out there were very conducive of letting these people off the hook.\"\n\n\n\nHow should Americans feel six decades later that the government freed the Nazi commanders responsible for atrocities against U.S. soldiers?\n\n\n\n\"We're supposed to feel very pissed off about that, to be perfectly honest, and that feeling is very justified,\" Zuroff said.\n\n\n\nThe German government has since made reparations to the soldiers held at Berga. Zuroff said now it's time for the U.S. government to do \"the right thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"To apologize,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Army said it is trying to figure out the best way to honor the Berga soldiers. There are about 20 known survivors still living.\n\n\n\n\"The U.S. Army honors the service and sacrifice of all veterans who have fought our nation's wars. The Army is working to identify the most dignified and personal way to honor the soldiers held at the Nazi slave camp, known as Berga,\" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Willie Harris said in a written statement.\n\n\n\nThe Army refused to answer further questions about the Berga case.  Listen in as an elderly man learns about his brother's death at the camp \u00bb\n\n\n\nSurvivors have long wanted to know why the sentences of the commanders were commuted. In a letter dated June 11, 1948, to an attorney whose nephew died at Berga, the U.S. War Department said the sentences of Metz and Merz were commuted because they were \"underlings.\"\n\n\n\nThe letter goes on to say that Metz \"though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners, except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape.\" That soldier was Morton Goldstein.\n\n\n\nSurvivors say Goldstein tried to escape but was captured. They say Metz stood him against a wall, walked up to him and shot him, execution-style, through the head. As his body lay on the ground, guards riddled him with bullets, according to survivors.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers who survived were not called to testify at the war crimes trial against Metz and Merz, instead prosecutors relied on about a dozen soldiers' statements gathered through the course of the investigation. At the trial, Metz blamed any deaths at the camp on U.S. medics.\n\n\n\n\"They bore the sole responsibility for the medical care,\" Metz told the court, according to the book \"Given Up for Dead,\" by Flint Whitlock, citing trial transcripts. \"I ask you: Who must bear the responsibility? The answer is obvious: The U.S. medics.\"\n\n\n\nThose comments don't sit well with Berga survivors. \"He was terrible, absolutely terrible. He lied,\" said Tony Acevedo, a U.S. medic who catalogued the deaths in a diary at the camp. \"Everybody hated his guts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Even the German guards were scared of him.\"  Flip through Acevedo's diary from the slave camp \u00bb\n\n\n\nBerga survivors say they await any recognition from the Army that may come, especially after all these years.\n\n\n\nMorton Brooks, 83, said he constantly thinks about the day he was liberated. He was rail thin and had walked by political prisoners shot in the head during the forced death march. In the final hours before his rescue, his attitude was, \"Let them kill us,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I think all the time that I'm a survivor of this and I'm still around,\" said Brooks. \"To me, it just amazes me. I don't know how I got through.\"\n\n\n\nJim Martin said he's still trying to process his father's role as a forgotten American war hero, armed not with a gun, but a camera.\n\n\n\n\"The worst part is I'm just finding it out,\" he said.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- The recession means competition in pro football this year isn't restricted to the gridiron. The National Football League and its 32 teams also are battling for the consumer's discretionary spending dollars.\n\n\n\nLess-established NFL teams, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars, face special challenges in the recession.\n\n\n\nAnd just like on the playing field, some teams are having an easier time scoring an economic touchdown than others.\n\n\n\n\"Overall ticket sales are very positive but difficult in these challenging times,\" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement. He did not provide overall ticket sales numbers for the current season.\n\n\n\nThe league is coming off a year that saw overall attendance drop slightly, 0.7 percent, from 2007 amid the start of the economic slowdown.\n\n\n\nBill Prescott, a Jacksonville Jaguars vice president and the team's chief financial officer, said the team started to see the impact of the recession last year, when single-game ticket sales and concession revenue dropped as the season progressed. Heading into this season, he said, sales are off even more than the team expected -- new ticket sales are down 75 percent from last year and season ticket renewals are down 10 percent.\n\n\n\nNo Jaguar games are sold out, despite a recent survey by The Media Audit that found 76 percent of adults in Jacksonville, Florida, regularly follow the Jaguars -- the fifth-best percentage of any NFL market.\n\n\n\n\"The economy is having that impact on us,\" Prescott said. \"As a very small market, I think we're feeling it more than some of the other teams in the league.\"\n\n\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings also have yet to sell out any of their games, though the team expects that could change with the recent high-profile signing of quarterback Brett Favre. Within a day of Favre's signing, the Vikings had sold an additional 3,000 season tickets and 10,000 single-game tickets.\n\n\n\n\"The economy's affecting all professional sports teams,\" said Steve LaCroix, the Vikings' vice president of sales and marketing. \"We're not only competing for people's time and money, but trying to keep the fans in the stadium on game day as opposed to watching on TV.\"\n\n\n\nLaCroix said there weren't a large number of cancellations in season ticket holder accounts. However, some fans did trim down the number of seats in their respective accounts. LaCroix added some are coming back on board as the season approaches.\n\n\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals are getting nationwide exposure through the HBO reality series \"Hard Knocks,\" which chronicles the team's training camp and preparation for the upcoming season. However, the Bengals' streak of 44 straight sellouts, a franchise record, is at risk, according to spokesman Jim Brennan. The Bengals' September 13 home opener against Denver is not sold out yet.\n\n\n\nSome teams, however, are more than holding their own as far as ticket sales go despite the nation's fiscal woes. The Denver Broncos are sold out for the 40th straight year -- dating back to the first game of the 1970 season, according to spokesman Jim Saccomano. And Chicago Bears spokesman Scott Hagel says the team is sold out for the 25th straight season. He adds the season ticket renewal rate is well over 90 percent, on par with the prior decade.\n\n\n\nAccording to league spokesman McCarthy, 24 of the NFL's 32 teams did not raise ticket prices from last year. One of the teams that did is the Indianapolis Colts, which bumped up the cost of 10 percent of its season ticket holder seats, according to team spokesman Craig Kelley. All games are sold out. Two factors working in the Colts' favor -- they have a new stadium that opened last season and the team has been a perennial contender for the past decade.\n\n\n\nIn order to try and offset the impact the economy has on the game, McCarthy said teams have created more options and flexibility for fans in order to help them afford tickets. Among those options are half-season ticket plans, such as the ones offered by the Jaguars and the New York Jets.\n\n\n\n\"We knew some season ticket holders because of the economy wouldn't be able to afford to come to all 10 games (including the preseason),\" said the Jaguars' Prescott. The half-season plan has been very popular, he said. \"We wanted to make as many products available to them whether they could come to one game, two games or with the half package we've bundled five games in each package so they can come for half a season.\" Prescott said the team is also considering introducing a package where fans can purchase tickets for a few games of their choice.\n\n\n\nDavid Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute, thinks the best way for teams to limit the recession's impact on ticket sales is to offer exemplary customer service.\n\n\n\n\"These fans need to feel as though they're having a great time and they're getting value for their money,\" said Carter. \"If they're able to do that, they will justify continuing to spend on the NFL, because every game matters. They want to be part of the continuity of the NFL season.\"\n\n\n\nCarter believes the league has to fight the recession on two fronts. He says the first is the pricing of seats to everyday fans -- especially those in markets where the demand isn't as keen as the NFL would like. The second challenge is corporate resistance.\n\n\n\n\"You have those that have traditionally purchased seats or acquired sponsorships taking a long look at whether they want to be involved this year or not, and a lot of corporate budgets are already in bed for the rest of the year,\" explained Carter.\n\n\n\nStill, Carter believes the NFL may be well-equipped to weather the economic storm, thanks in large part to timing.\n\n\n\n\"There's a general feel that things are picking up in the economy, and I think that's going to bode well for them over time. They may have survived this downturn a little better than the other leagues.\"\n\n\n\nMatt Gonter has been a Washington Redskins season ticket holder for the past five years. He said he briefly considered whether to cancel his subscription heading into this year but decided against it -- citing the team's long waiting list to get season tickets.\n\n\n\n\"I swore to myself if I ever got Redskins season tickets, I'd do everything in my power to keep them,\" Gonter said.\n\n\n\nHowever, he did turn down an option to upgrade to different seats and a parking pass, saying he would have considered it in years past but not under the current economic climate. He also might sell his tickets for certain games online.\n\n\n\n\"I'm thinking of going on StubHub and selling a couple of tickets. I eat so much of the cost for the preseason tickets, because you have to pay full price for those,\" Gonter said. One ticket for an NFL game this year on the secondary ticket seller goes for an average of $151, compared with $156 at this time a year ago.\n\n\n\nFour-year Cleveland Browns season ticket holder Zeke Paster held on to his subscription and plans to make cutbacks instead when it comes to concessions and tailgating costs. However, he may get rid of some of his tickets before the season is over.\n\n\n\n\"If they're not doing well, I would maybe try to sell the tickets for some of the cold weather games,\" Paster said.\n\n\n\nPaster and Gonter admit surrendering their season ticket packages for good would be a painful decision.\n\n\n\n\"The atmosphere is unmatched,\" Paster said. \"There's nothing like being in the stadium or in the parking lot when the Browns are doing well.\"\n\n\n\nGonter says the camaraderie is worth the cost.\n\n\n\n\"I just like the experience of sitting in the parking lot under a tent, tailgating, drinking beer and then going to the game and having a good time watching the Redskins.\"",

Investigators also developed information that led them to note specific inconsistencies in the initial statement provided by [the man].\"\n\n\n\nBut on Tuesday, police found that the man \"had responded to at least two personal ads on Craigslist.com in an effort to arrange for someone to come to his home and have sex with his wife using some type of scare tactic.\"\n\n\n\n\"Investigators believe [he] arranged this incident without the knowledge or consent of the victim,\" the police statement said.\n\n\n\nThe woman was taken to a hospital after the assault, where she underwent a forensic examination and was interviewed, police said. She suffered no serious physical injuries and was released shortly afterward.\n\n\n\nPolice did not release the identity of the victim. CNN is not naming the victim's husband in an effort to avoid identifying her. The incident remains under investigation, police said.\n\n\n\nThe man faces charges including first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree sexual offense and one count of attempted first-degree sexual offense, according to the police statement.\n\n\n\nKannapolis is about 26 miles northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Described as the largest single gathering of displaced residents in the world today, tens of thousands of civilians are seeking shelter along the Afgooye corridor outside Mogadishu, according to the United Nations.\n\n\n\nMembers of the U.S. Navy take a young Somali boy to safety after rescuing him and 51 others adrift in a skiff.\n\n\n\nFighting between government forces and Islamist militias has triggered the flight of more than 67,000 Somalis in and around Mogadishu since May 8, the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMost of them are heading to the Afgooye corridor, a 30-kilometer (19-mile) stretch of ramshackle housing described by the United Nations' World Food Program as \"a nightmare.\"\n\n\n\nThe corridor between Mogadishu and the town of Afgooye is already home to 400,000 displaced Somalis, some of them living in huts made of twigs and branches. The clinics are already overwhelmed with malnourished and sick children.\n\n\n\nThis week, Somalia's transitional president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, asked the international community \"to help Somalia defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country.\"\n\n\n\nAhmed told local journalists Monday that he feared these foreign fighters would turn Somalia into another Iraq or Afghanistan, where U.S.-led forces are fighting Islamic extremist groups.\n\n\n\nThe fighting has cut supplies of \"desperately needed humanitarian aid\" to the displaced Somalis near the capital city, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\n\n\n\"We are starting today the distribution of aid for some 50,000 people in Afgooye corridor through our local partners in Somalia,\" the refugee office said Tuesday. \"Today's distribution will include cooking sets, plastic sheeting, blankets and mats.\"\n\n\n\nThe number of Somali refugees fleeing to nearby countries also continues to rise, with some 500,000 already in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Djibouti, Eritrea and Tanzania.\n\n\n\nMany Somalis have also made the dangerous journey across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, a U.S. guided missile destroyer rescued a group of 52 Somali men women and children -- including a woman who was eight months pregnant -- who had been stranded aboard a small skiff for nearly a week off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Navy said.  See photos of the rescue \u00bb\n\n\n\nA helicopter based on the USS Lake Champlain happened to spot the stranded mariners, according to the vessel's commanding officer.\n\n\n\n\"It's fortunate that our helicopter was flying over the right place at the right time,\" Capt. Kevin P. Campbell said in a U.S. Navy news release. \"I'm glad we were able to be of assistance and rescue these men, women and children. Our chief hospital corpsman stated that had we not found them at the time we did, the pregnant woman may not have survived.\"\n\n\n\nUSS Lake Champlain has been deployed as part of the U.S. 5th Fleet's mission to patrol the Gulf of Aden region, which has been plagued by pirate attacks off Somalia's coast.\n\n\n\n\"We were very fortunate to have come across these people in the state they were in,\" said the ship's chaplain, Lt. j.g. Jarrod Johnson. \"Seeing their condition really makes your heart go out to them. You can see the relief and hope in their eyes, and hear it in their conversation.\"",

  "context": "Paris (CNN) -- Flamboyant fashion designer John Galliano went on trial Wednesday, accused of making anti-Semitic comments against at least three people in a Paris cafe.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano, who was fired by fashion giant Christian Dior in March after video surfaced showing him praising Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, testified Wednesday that drugs were to blame.\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge Anne-Marie Sauteraud read out a list of the abuse Galliano is accused of hurling at Geraldine Bloch and Philippe Virgitti, including obscenities mixed with remarks about their ethnic backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He said 'dirty whore' at least a thousand times,\" the judge said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano said on the witness stand that he had no memory of making the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked to explain his \"lack of memory,\" he said: \"I have an addiction. I am currently undergoing treatment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano's attorney said before the trial began the designer \"was a sick person, who was suffering from addiction and this is something we are demonstrating through medical evidence, expert reports.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must not judge a man who for 30 years has been dedicated to diversity, who has been a loving person for all races, cultures and religions ... based on 40 minutes where he was sick through alcohol and medication,\" Aurelien Hamelle said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano testified that he suffered from an increasing workload and no time to mourn after the 2007 death of his alter ego at Dior, designer Steven Robinson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With his death, I found I had no protection,\" Galliano said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis body became dependent on drugs, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was taking sleeping pills during the day,\" he testified.   \"I've only just discovered since rehab what a lethal mix I was taking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBloch testified Wednesday that she encountered Galliano on a crowded cafe terrace, which led to an angry exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't remember his exact wording; there were different phrases,\" Bloch told the court.  \"It's true that I was angry. I insulted him, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVirgitti testified the confrontation, which he called \"just an argument in a bar,\" began when Galliano sat down next to his party at the cafe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He started speaking to us very quickly after arriving,\" Virgitti said. \"He told Geraldine to speak less as she was disturbing him. We didn't know what to do. The situation got worse. He started touching her hair, saying she had no hair.  I told him, 'Don't touch her.' \"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged during his testimony that while Galliano \"said things he shouldn't have,\" the incident \"has been so overly played out in the media.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano faces a six-month jail term and a fine of 22,500 euros ($32,410) if he is convicted, according to prosecutors.\n\n\n\n\n\nA verdict in the case did not come Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano will be judged in one trial over two separate incidents, one in October and one in February.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the second incident, Galliano was taken to a police station where a test revealed he had a high level of alcohol in his blood, authorities said at the time. He was later released.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video is from yet another incident. He is not being tried for the incident because the couple involved chose not to press charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I love Hitler,\" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. \"Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Dior condemned his \"deeply offensive statements and conduct.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench law prohibits the incitement of racial discrimination, hatred or violence based on a person's origin or their membership -- or nonmembership -- in an ethic, national, racial or religious group.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano apologized after the video was released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I only have myself to blame and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion,\" Galliano said in a statement. \"Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGalliano has kept a low profile since his firing, but Vanessa Friedman, fashion editor of the Financial Times newspaper, said that given time, he could return to the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis career is over in its present form, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he could return to Britain, where there is \"residual love for him,\" lay low and make a comeback in a few years, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People love a redemption story,\" Friedman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Saskya Vandoorne, Catherine Clifford and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.",

  "context": "'SINDH KALAY', England (CNN) -- The aroma of freshly baking flatbread wafts through the air as a unit of British soldiers position themselves for a quick patrol around the village of Sindh Kalay.\n\n\n\nA British soldier on patrol in the mock Afghan village of Sindh Kalay.\n\n\n\nMarket vendors hawk grapes and melons, as a group of village elders sit smoking water pipes and suspicious-looking men lurk beside battered motorcycles. What should the soldiers do? Conduct a weapons search? Approach the village elders first? In the complex political and cultural terrain of Afghanistan, what is the best course of action?\n\n\n\nExcept this is not Afghanistan. It's Norfolk, England. Instead of the Hindu Kush mountains, it is the green ladscape and tidy farmhouses of the English countryside that stretch out behind them.\n\n\n\nWelcome to the British Army's state-of-the art training ground. It cost more than $20 million to build and every British soldier serving in Afghanistan will do his or her training here.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's the closest thing you are going to get short of being in Afghanistan itself,\" says Col. David Colthup of the 2nd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. His troops have already served one tour of duty in Afghanistan's Helmand province and are training for another.\n\n\n\nBritish troops serving in Helmand province are tasked with mentoring and training Afghan security forces. Not an easy job in a Taliban stronghold and Afghanistan's center of opium production.\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, a soldier joins the army and trains to fight. That's what a soldier trains to do. But today, it's a much, much more complex environment,\" explains Colthup.\n\n\n\n\"The business of being able to interact either through an interpreter or through Afghan security forces, whether they are police or army. And to understand how the people operate and how we can interact better with them. Because ultimately, that's what it's about,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe most distinctive features of Sindh Kalay are the high three-meter walls that make up the village compound, creating narrow alleyways difficult for troops to patrol.\n\n\n\nThe village is staffed with Afghan asylum-seekers, many of whom have fled the Taliban. They play the roles of market vendors, village elders and sometimes Afghan security forces. Several Afghan women are also on hand, useful for training British soldiers on the religious and cultural sensitivities of entering an Afghan home.  Watch British troops training in mock Afghan village \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe Taliban insurgents are played by Nepalese Ghurkha soldiers authorized to handle weapons. They play their roles silently, unable to partake in the Pashtun banter among the Afghans.\n\n\n\nFazel Beria is also an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan. He is responsible for recruiting and for creating the sights and smells of Sindh Kalay and is easily identifiable as the only Afghan in the market in Western clothes. He beams with pride walking down the bazaar and clearly relishes his role in training the British Army.\n\n\n\n\"Everything with the culture comes up with the issue of hearts and minds,\" he explains. \"If you want to win that, you need to know about their culture. You need to respect their culture, their religion and their way of life.\"\n\n\n\nHe gives high marks to the soldiers training so far. After each exercise, the Afghan actors talk directly to the soldiers about what went wrong and what went right. Sometimes, it's the little things that count.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, there have been quite a lot of surprises,\" Beria says. Like Afghan will sit cross legged for hours. \"The British soldier cannot do that,\" he laughs. \"The Afghan will be sitting very comfortable and the British soldier is not. So, they have to get used to it.\"  See photos of British troops on patrol in Sindh Kalay -- and for real in Afghanistan \u00bb\n\n\n\nPreviously, the army trained on farmhouses and in urban neighborhoods that resembled Northern Ireland more than Afghanistan. But Sindh Kalay does more than mimic the physical reality of Afghanistan. It also mirrors the changing tactics on the ground.\n\n\n\nTroops are grilled in IED training by amputees that act out the violence with latex wounds and fake blood. When a new IED tactic is discovered by troops in Afghanistan it is communicated to Sindh Kalay and put into practice immediately.\n\n\n\n\"Before we had this, it wasn't realistic enough,\" says Col. Richard Westley, head of training here. \"I think if you're going to be asking young men and women to go and risk their lives in someone else's country, then you have a moral obligation to prepare them for that environment. And that's what this village does. It gives them the isolation and complexity of an Afghan village. Which we can't do with farmhouses which represent Western Europe.\"\n\n\n\nSome of the details in the Afghan village don't quite ring true. The slabs of lamb and beef hanging from the market stalls are plastic, as are the grapes and melons the vendors try and sell to the British soldiers.\n\n\n\nStill, Sindh Kalay is eerily effective. When soldiers sit down for a \"shura\" or meeting with village elders, helicopters buzz overhead and the soldiers seem surprised to be served a homemade yogurt and cucumber drink.\n\n\n\nBut the unit commander can't help laughing when one of the Afghan village heads pulls out a \"list of damages\" by British troops. It turns out to be a receipt for the local supermarket.",

It's keeping in touch with Sammy, her collie-lab mix, that's the problem.\n\n\n\n\"I can talk to my dog on the phone, but I don't get anything out of it,\" Chen said.\n\n\n\nChen is not the only student who misses her pet, an integral part of many families.\n\n\n\nAccording to membership in Facebook groups dedicated to the topic, at least 44,845 others are in the same boat.\n\n\n\nThere are at least six groups dedicated to missing one's pet on the social networking site; the largest, \"I love college, but I miss my dog,\" stands at 31,056 members.\n\n\n\nThe group's wall is full of declarations of love for dogs at home, often accompanied by pictures and funny stories in the photo and discussion board sections.\n\n\n\nChen, one of the group's newest members, said she joined when she realized the forum was a literal representation of missing her dog. In some respects, Chen said, she actually misses her dog more than she misses her parents.\n\n\n\n\"My dog never says 'Go to bed,' or 'You have to be in by two,' \" she said. \"My dog just says, 'I'm happy to see you, even if it's 2:30 in the morning.' \"\n\n\n\nGW's Facebook network has its own group for pet lovers: \"I Miss My Dog.\" Its 89 members frequently post pictures of their \"four- and sometimes three-legged friends at home,\" as the group's description states.\n\n\n\nThe group's active members use it as a way to further express themselves on Facebook and to cope with missing their animals back home.\n\n\n\nLike Chen, junior Jared Stone said he did not realize how much his dogs were a part of his life until he came to college.\n\n\n\n\"In the past, I had always been at home and always been around my dogs,\" Stone said. \"I was used to having them nearby and petting them while watching TV. So in college, their absence hit me and I found the group on Facebook an accurate representation of how I was feeling.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough a freshman like Chen is still adjusting to college life away from pets, Stone has learned that students must learn to deal with missing their pets.\n\n\n\n\"Friends fill the gap so much, but can only go so far,\" he said. \"I've overcome it, but it's still nothing you can really get over.\"\n\n\n\nMany students, including law student and \"I Miss My Dog\" member Rebecca Rodgers, hope to eventually have dogs of their own, but they know that college is not conducive to pet ownership.\n\n\n\n\"My studio is no place for a dog and definitely not with a crazy law school schedule,\" Rodgers said.\n\n\n\nWhen Rodgers misses her Australian shepherd, Missy, she turns to the popular video-sharing Web site YouTube.\n\n\n\n\"I tend to watch (my) particular breed of dog, Australian shepherds,\" Rodgers said. \"Seeing other people's dogs makes me miss mine a little less.\"\n\n\n\nChen also uses technology to cope, though in a more personal manner.\n\n\n\n\"I video chat with my dog,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAlthough she does not plan on getting a dog on campus any time soon, she jokes about adopting a \"hallway dog\" for Lafayette, where she lives this year.\n\n\n\nThe Internet and hopes for the future, though good coping aids, can only help those missing their pets to an extent.\n\n\n\nRodgers said, \"Sometimes I look over my shoulder and expect a dog to follow me around.\"",

  "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Nearly all healthy pregnant women who receive a single dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine will be protected from that flu, according to just-released clinical trial data.\n\n\n\nIn a news conference Monday at the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said out of about 100 pregnant women who participated in trial studies, over 90 percent showed a robust immune response to a single 15-microgram dose of the H1N1 vaccine. And at this point, there have been no reported side effects, Fauci said.\n\n\n\nFauci stressed that these results should be reassuring for already-vaccinated pregnant women and this is \"vital information for those who have not yet been vaccinated.\" He added that \"pregnant women have tolerated the vaccine well, and no safety concerns have arisen.\"\n\n\n\nPregnant women are considered to be among the highest at risk for serious complications of this new flu strain. Since H1N1, also known as swine flu, first emerged in April, 28 pregnant women reportedly have died from complications of this flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\n\nDespite health officials repeatedly saying the H1N1 vaccine is safe, questions about it persist. To reassure those who question the safety of the vaccine, Dr. Bruce Gellin, director of the National Vaccine Program Office, noted that a new independent panel has been formed to review data from all sources on the safety of the vaccine.\n\n\n\nThe group will monitor all sources reporting problems with the vaccine.\n\n\n\n\"The vast amount of adverse events have been minor,\" said Gellin. He said there has been one reported death linked to the vaccine, but further investigation showed that the person died from the actual H1N1 flu, not the vaccine. Gellin said the panel was designed to keep an eye on any possible negative consequences and report them immediately.\n\n\n\nAccording to Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, who also attended the news conference, 30 million doses of the vaccine are available for states to order.\n\n\n\nShe explained that that does not mean 30 million shots are available to the public at this point. The vaccines need to be ordered by each state and distributed before they make it to doctor's offices and clinics.\n\n\n\nSchuchat reassured the public that more vaccines would be made available within the next few weeks, as demand for shots continues to rise.\n\n\n\nFauci also noted further studies on children -- youngsters between the ages of 6 months to 35 months, and children from the age of 3 years to 9 years -- found they responded much better to two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, than one single dose.\n\n\n\nFor children 9 and older, a single 15-microgram dose gave young people a robust immune reaction that should protect them against the virus.\n\n\n\nWhen asked how this H1N1 virus differed from the seasonal flu, Schuchat said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to high-risk patients.\n\n\n\n\"With seasonal flu,\" said Schuchat, \"Ninety percent of the deaths every year are in people over the age of 65.\" She noted, \"But with H1N1, 90 percent of the deaths, thus far, have been in people under the age of 65.\"\n\n\n\nAnd she added, \"half of those are under the age of 25 years, in young people. So those are the people we want to get our message to. Children, pregnant women, young people should be getting vaccinated.\"\n\n\n\nFauci agreed saying, \"You need to look at the risk ... Right now, the risk of becoming seriously ill, even dying from this virus, outweighs the risk of something happening to you if you take the vaccine. It's really that simple.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.",

  "context": "BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) -- You know you've arrived at Bengies Drive-In Theatre when you first see the giant movie marquee, announcing the features showing that weekend. Each letter has to be placed and adjusted by hand, as it did when the theater first opened.\n\n\n\nBengies Drive-In Theatre has been owned by the same family since it opened in 1956.\n\n\n\n\"As far as the operation of the drive-in goes, I'm kind of a die-hard. I try to make it run the way it did, to bring a little bit back of the '50s. ... the integrity and the innocence of that age,\" says Bengies owner D. Edward Vogel, who claims to have the largest outdoor movie screen in the country at 52 feet by 120 feet.\n\n\n\nVogel has spent most of his life trying to maintain the feel and charm of the Baltimore, Maryland, drive-in movie theater that his family opened in 1956. Vogel wants moviegoers to have the same experience as he did when he went to his family's outdoor theater as a child, although he knows that people today have many more entertainment options.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes I'm actually taken aback with the amount of children that are fascinated with this,\" says Vogel. \"Thinking of what their options are, with modern devices and videos and all that, that they are so taken aback . with what happens here.\"\n\n\n\nVogel started learning, at age 9, the secrets of running a movie theater from his father, Jack Vogel. He has worked tirelessly since to maintain the theater as it was in its glory days. Vogel even operates the same machines that he did as a child; the projection room is filled with the original projectors, which Vogel cleans and cares for each night.\n\n\n\nAnd for each movie, threading the film is a complex process far removed from the simplicity of inserting a DVD into the player that we know today. Once threaded, the film spins around as each frame follows an intricate path from the tray, to the projector, until it is shown on the gigantic screen.  Watch the drive-in come to life \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe scene immediately invokes a feeling of nostalgia, reminding us why they were called \"motion pictures\" way back when. Yet, Vogel is quick to tell you that keeping the 53-year-old business alive hasn't always been easy.\n\n\n\nAt Bengies, each night is a double feature, so guests can see at least two movies for $8 a person. Vogel estimates that Bengies makes 60 percent of its revenue from ticket sales, and the rest comes from concession purchases. There's a strict \"no outside food\" policy, and he's open about the fact that the food sales help keep the business open.\n\n\n\nThe waterfront property would be more profitable as condos, he says, and his father planned to build them before Vogel took over the theater in the 1980s. He was only able to avoid closing by cutting costs and staff.\n\n\n\n\"My parents had a union operator in the booth, they had a manager, they had a concessionaire. I am all of those things, so that has changed,\" Vogel says.\n\n\n\nVogel even acts as the host. Known only as \"the voice\" to his audiences, he starts each night by using the theater's speaker system to welcome everyone to his venue.\n\n\n\n\"When you see the sun setting, and the shadow being cast on that screen, no matter what has happened during that day, good, bad or indifferent, I become a different person when I turn the microphone on.\"\n\n\n\nBesides the challenges of being a small business owner, Vogel's efforts to maintain the integrity of the movie-going experience is challenged by another intrusion of this modern world -- light pollution.\n\n\n\nBetween car headlights and brightly lit businesses nearby, a once-dark sky is now polluted with obtrusive light. Bengies asks that drivers turn their headlights off when entering the grounds of the theater. But over the years, it has been the outside light from other businesses that bleeds into the surrounding sky, making the giant screen hard to see.\n\n\n\nFor solutions to such predicaments, Vogel turns to the owners of other drive-in theaters that have managed to survive since the 1930s. He is an active member of a drive-in theater owners association and is working with other owners across the country to support each other.\n\n\n\n\"They would all have easier lives if they opened Laundromats in the right location, but they don't. They endeavor; there is a passion about it,\" Vogel says.\n\n\n\nIt is a passion that his audience seems to appreciate.\n\n\n\nAs the sun lowers in the sky and eventually sets behind the screen, the ticket booth is opened on a Sunday night in autumn. People make the trip to the last drive-in theater in the Baltimore area. They set up their chairs, and some sit in their classic cars to enjoy the show.\n\n\n\nIt's an experience Vogel hopes to keep around for generations to come.",

The U.N. brokered peace accord in the area in January.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, thousands fleeing Kibumba spurred violent demonstrations in front of the U.N. compound in Goma. The group was angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from renewed bouts of violence in the country, a U.N. spokesman told CNN.\n\n\n\nA U.N. spokesman said the U.N.'s mission in Congo was \"under attack\" on Monday.\n\n\n\nA mission staff member inside the U.N. compound, who did not want to give his name for security reasons, said U.N. security forces had returned fire in an attempt to disperse angry crowds near the U.N. compound. Gunshots could be heard as he spoke on the phone.\n\n\n\nHe said the attack had resulted in several deaths. U.N. officials confirmed one dead in Goma as a result of Monday's demonstrations.\n\n\n\nThe assault died down later in the day, a U.N. spokesman said, but people continued to pelt the building.\n\n\n\nIt was unclear who was attacking, but the staff member told CNN the people were from a village that had been taken over by the CNDP, a Congolese renegade group led by Gen. Laurent Nkunda that seized a major military camp and gorilla park in a renewed bout of heavy fighting Sunday.\n\n\n\nThousands of civilians were reportedly fleeing the fighting. Pictures from the region showed long lines of people walking along roads carrying their belongings.  Watch how refugees line roads to get away \u00bb\n\n\n\nSoldiers who abandoned the military camp were retreating in vehicles on a main road outside of Goma on Monday, angrily honking their horns at civilians who got in their way, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\nBertrand Bisimwa, a spokesman for the rebels, told the AP that rebel fighters had moved to within 7 miles (11 kilometers) of Goma.\n\n\n\nThe latest fighting comes after the collapse on Sunday of a tenuous week-old U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces.\n\n\n\nAccording to U.N. spokesman Nick Birnback, thousands of displaced civilians in the city of Goma were throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from the violence.\n\n\n\n\"The situation in Goma is very volatile,\" he said. \"But MONUC is taking all available measures to stabilize the situation.\"   Watch more about the fighting \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe U.N. mission -- known by its French acronym, MONUC -- is in Goma, which is along Congo's border with Rwanda.\n\n\n\nAlthough the civil war in Congo -- once known as Zaire -- officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and CNDP rebels under has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes, according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux.  Watch ranger describe the violence \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe conflict and humanitarian crisis in Congo have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998, and 45,000 people die there every month, according to an International Rescue Committee report in January.\n\n\n\nA senior U.S. State Department official said the United States is pushing hard for cooperation among Rwanda, Uganda and Congo over the situation in eastern Congo. The official said all countries, especially Congo and Rwanda, \"need to work together\" to rein in \"militia groups and other negative forces.\"\n\n\n\nAssistant U.S. Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer will travel to Congo and Rwanda to urge both governments to take action, the official said.\n\n\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement Monday calling on all parties \"to make every effort to restore calm among the affected populations.\"\n\n\n\nThe attacks also coincided with the resignation of the U.N. military commander in Congo, Lt. Gen. Vicente Diaz de Villegas y Herreria. A U.N. statement on Monday indicated he stepped down for \"personal reasons.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.",

  "context": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida amusement park visitors may enjoy space-themed roller-coasters, but the first vehicle they board at Orlando International Airport may be the most futuristic ride of their vacation.\n\n\n\nFour hydrogen shuttle buses are part of the fleet at the Orlando International Airport.\n\n\n\nThe airport is testing four Ford shuttle vans equipped with internal combustion engines modified to run on hydrogen instead of gasoline.\n\n\n\n\"It's quiet, it doesn't shake like diesel, it doesn't have that diesel smell,\" said Rafael Sanchez, who has been driving the vans for a year. The quieter engine makes conversation inside the bus easier than in conventional vehicles.\n\n\n\n\"Hydrogen is one of the many technologies we are exploring, trying to become more of a green airport,\" said Ronald Lewis, director of airport operations.\n\n\n\nVehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines.\n\n\n\nThe use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells.\n\n\n\nThe modified engines aboard the Ford E-450 shuttle buses are 6.8 liter V-10s. The airport's fleet also includes three gas-electric hybrid vehicles and 24 biodiesel buses. The facility also powers its maintenance equipment -- such as lawnmowers and tractors -- with biodiesel.\n\n\n\nBut like many experiments with alternative fuels, the price is very high and the long-term outcome is unknown. Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use.\n\n\n\nEnergy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around, but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up.\n\n\n\n\"It is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20, 30, maybe 40 years,\" said John Lapetz, who has been working on alternative fuels at Ford for more than 20 years.\n\n\n\nThe Orlando project has several goals: To get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop.\n\n\n\nLapetz said it's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted (the internal combustion engine), while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nAt the Boggy Creek Hydrogen Fueling Station in Orlando, the hydrogen is produced on-site. \"We are doing a process called steam methane re-forming, which is natural gas to hydrogen,\" said Puneet Verma, manager of biofuels and hydrogen at Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the players involved in the project.\n\n\n\nDuring a careful fueling process, technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump.\n\n\n\nBecause a fossil fuel, methane, is used to make the hydrogen, the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured.\n\n\n\n\"We view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success,\" said Verma. \"This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station. It's not necessarily an economic success yet.\"\n\n\n\n\"The ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars,\" Verma said. \"The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture, but they consume a lot more hydrogen.\"\n\n\n\nVerma said the buses are \"valid transition technology\" aimed at quickly building significant demand for hydrogen, which would then justify an expensive infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe hydrogen test project also includes the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, Ford Motor Company, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Progress Energy and SeaWorld.\n\n\n\nHydrogen buses began shuttling SeaWorld employees in February from the park's outer parking lots to their workplaces.\n\n\n\n\"The environment is really an important part of SeaWorld's culture here,\" said Kelly Bernish, director of environmental health and safety at Busch theme parks SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and Aquatica.\n\n\n\nBernish described the venture as another opportunity for \"employees to feel like they can impact the environment by using this kind of vehicle, that will lessen our footprint on the world.\"\n\n\n\nSeaWorld's Discovery Cove animal training supervisor Jay Tacey said \"somebody has to get the ball rolling. Until somebody takes that first step, there's always going to be the 'what if?' \"\n\n\n\nAirport Operations Director Lewis said being in on the hydrogen experiment early could pay off in the long run.\n\n\n\n\"We are hopeful that since they built the facility here, the only one in the southeast United States, that there will be a long-term usage for it.\"",

  "context": "Editor's note: This is an excerpt from \"Zeitoun\" by Dave Eggers, a nonfiction account of a Syrian-American immigrant and his extraordinary experience during Hurricane Katrina. Eggers is the author of five other books, including \"What Is the What,\" a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award. Eggers is the founder and editor of McSweeney's, an independent publishing house based in San Francisco.\n\n\n\nDave Eggers writes that Abdulrahman Zeitoun dreamed of fishing on the Syrian coast as Katrina approached.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2005\n\n\n\nOn moonless nights the men and boys of Jableh, a dusty fishing town on the coast of Syria, would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats. Five or six small craft, two or three fishermen in each. A mile out, they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea, drop their nets, and, holding their lanterns over the water, they would approximate the moon.\n\n\n\nThe fish, sardines, would begin gathering soon after, a slow mass of silver rising from below. The fish were attracted to plankton, and the plankton were attracted to the light. They would begin to circle, a chain linked loosely, and over the next hour their numbers would grow. The black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see, below, a solid mass of silver spinning.\n\n\n\nAbdulrahman Zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way, a method called lampara, borrowed from the Italians. He had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats, and he'd spent those years asking questions. Why only on moonless nights? Because, his brother Ahmad said, on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere, spread out all over the sea, and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease. But without a moon the men could make their own, and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations. You have to see it, Ahmad told his little brother. You've never seen anything like this.\n\n\n\nAnd when Abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight, the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light. He said nothing, and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet, too, paddling without motors, lest they scare away the catch. They would whisper over the sea, telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them. A few hours later, once the sardines were ready, tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light, the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in.\n\n\n\nThey would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn. He would pay the men and boys, and would then sell the fish all over western Syria -- Lattakia, Baniyas, Damascus. The fishermen would split the money, with Abdulrahman and Ahmad bringing their share home. Their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind, so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings.\n\n\n\nAbdulrahman and Ahmad didn't care much about the money, though. They would have done it for free.\n\n\n\nThirty-four years later and thousands of miles west, Abdulrahman Zeitoun was in bed on a Friday morning, slowly leaving the moonless Jableh night, a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream. He was in his home in New Orleans and beside him he could hear his wife Kathy breathing, her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat. Otherwise the house was silent. He knew it was near six o'clock, and the peace would not last. The morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows. One of the four would open his or her eyes, and from there the movements were brisk, the house quickly growing loud. With one child awake, it was impossible to keep the other three in bed.\n\n\n\nKathy woke to a thump upstairs, coming from one of the kids' rooms. She listened closely, praying silently for rest. Each morning there was a delicate period, between six and six-thirty, when there was a chance, however remote, that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. But now there was another thump, and the dog barked, and another thump followed. What was happening in this house? Kathy looked to her husband. He was staring at the ceiling. The day had roared to life.\n\n\n\nThe phone began ringing, today as always, before their feet hit the floor. Kathy and Zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because they couldn't pronounce his first -- ran a company, Zeitoun A. Painting Contractor LLC, and every day their crews, their clients, everyone with a phone and their number, seemed to think that once the clock struck six-thirty, it was appropriate to call. And they called. Usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six-thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail.\n\n\n\nKathy took the first one, from a client across town, while Zeitoun shuffled into the shower. Fridays were always busy, but this one promised madness, given the rough weather on the way. There had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the Florida Keys, a chance it might head north. Though this kind of possibility presented itself every August and didn't raise eyebrows for most, Kathy and Zeitoun's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations. Throughout the morning the callers would want to know if Zeitoun could board up their windows and doors, if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came. Workers would want to know if they'd be expected to come in that day or the next.\n\n\n\n\"Zeitoun Painting Contractors,\" Kathy said, trying to sound alert. It was an elderly client, a woman living alone in a Garden District mansion, asking if Zeitoun's crew could come over and board up her windows.\n\n\n\n\"Sure, of course,\" Kathy said, letting her feet drop heavily to the floor. She was up. Kathy was the business's secretary, bookkeeper, credit department, public-relations manager -- she did everything in the office, while her husband handled the building and painting. The two of them balanced each other well: Zeitoun's English had its limits, so when bills had to be negotiated, hearing Kathy's Louisiana drawl put clients at ease.\n\n\n\nThis was part of the job, helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds. Kathy hadn't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about. It took a lot more than a few downed trees in south Florida to get her attention.\n\n\n\n\"We'll have a crew over this afternoon,\" Kathy told the woman.\n\n\n\nKathy and Zeitoun had been married for eleven years. Zeitoun had come to New Orleans in 1994, by way of Houston and Baton Rouge and a half-dozen other American cities he'd explored as a young man. Kathy had grown up in Baton Rouge and was used to the hurricane routine: the litany of preparations, the waiting and watching, the power outages, the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain. There seemed to be a half-dozen named storms every August, and they were rarely worth the trouble. This one, named Katrina, would be no different.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- From the mid-1980s, Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist George Soros pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into foundations in Eastern Europe dedicated to promoting the idea of the \"open society\" and challenging the region's Soviet-backed regimes. Here, writing exclusively for CNN.com, he describes how the work of his foundations ultimately contributed to the collapse of communism.\n\n\n\nA Soviet tank rolls through Budapest during the failed 1956 Hungarian uprising against communist domination.\n\n\n\nI set up my first foundation in Hungary in 1984. The idea behind it was simple. The state dogma, promoted by the ruling communists, was false and by providing an alternative we could expose its falsehood. Accordingly we supported every cultural initiative that was not an expression of the established dogma.\n\n\n\nI was guided by the concept of the \"open society,\" which I adopted from the philosopher Karl Popper. I saw the open society as a more sophisticated form of social organization than the totalitarian closed societies of the Soviet bloc.\n\n\n\nThe latter were trying to implement central plans; in an open society every individual or organization was supposed to implement their own plan. To make the transition from a closed to an open society would require outside help and that was what my foundations sought to provide.\n\n\n\nIn Hungary the authorities insisted on having a controlling presence on the foundation's board. We eventually agreed to appoint two chief executives, one nominated by them and one by me.\n\n\n\nThe project succeeded beyond my expectations. With very small amounts of money people could engage in a wide variety of civic initiatives ranging from self-governing student colleges to zither clubs.\n\n\n\nOne of our first projects was to offer photocopying machines to cultural and scientific institutions in exchange for local currency. We used the money to give out local grants and support all kinds of unofficial initiatives, but the photocopying machines also did a lot of good.\n\n\n\nUp until then, the few existing copy machines were literally held under lock and key -- as more and more became available, the Party apparatus lost control of the machines and the dissemination of information.\n\n\n\nWe did not have to exercise direct control. Civil society watched over the foundation. For instance, we were warned that a blind association, to whom we gave a grant for talking books, was stealing some of the money. With a budget of $3 million, the foundation had more influence on the cultural life of Hungary than the Ministry of Culture.\n\n\n\nCarried away my success in Hungary, by 1988 I had set up foundations in Poland, China and the Soviet Union. I think that I could have influenced General Jaruzelski in Poland to change his attitude toward the opposition and to see that dissidents such as Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron were also patriots despite their criticism of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nAs the Soviet empire collapsed, and eventually the Soviet Union and also Yugoslavia disintegrated, we continued to expand. By 1992 there were foundations in 22 countries and expenditure had reached $53 million. A year later we were spending nearly $184 million.\n\n\n\nRight at the beginning, I had a disagreement with the Polish board about the way the foundation should be run. But that taught me a lesson. They were right and I was wrong. I realized that the people living there understood their country better than I did and I deferred to their judgment.\n\n\n\nIt did not always work. In Bulgaria, a board member who made his name as a human rights activist turned out to be a racist. A Latvian businessman sought to hijack the foundation for nationalist purposes. It was the Russian foundation that gave us the most trouble; we had to reorganize it twice.\n\n\n\nBut the foundations were the first out of the gate everywhere. I remembered the lesson my father who had lived through the Russian Revolution in Siberia taught me: In revolutionary times things that are normally impossible become possible.\n\n\n\nIn Ukraine, we set up the Ukrainian Renaissance Foundation before Ukraine became independent. In Tajikistan, we persevered with the foundation during the five-year civil war although we had no way of controlling its activities. Our impact was the greatest during that turbulent period.\n\n\n\nWhen I set up the foundations in Eastern Europe I hoped the open societies of the West would follow in my footsteps, but in that regard I was disappointed. Unwilling to burden their own budgets, they gave the job to the International Monetary Fund, which was ill suited to the task.\n\n\n\nThe IMF was accustomed to signing letters of intent with governments, making the continuation of their programs conditional on the governments fulfilling their obligations. The countries of Eastern Europe fared better, but in the former Soviet states one after another, the programs largely failed.\n\n\n\nEast Germany was the exception: West Germany was willing to make the sacrifices that were necessary to integrate it. Eventually, the countries of Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, also made the grade when the European Union gave them accession. But the rest of the former Soviet Union in the Caucasus and Central Asia never succeeded in making the transition.\n\n\n\nThis has left a bitter legacy. Rightly or wrongly, both the rulers and the people of Russia harbor a deep resentment against the West, which the West has not come to grips with.\n\n\n\nThe new order in Moscow that has emerged out of the chaos of the 1990s is very far from an open society. It is an authoritarian regime that preserves the outward appearances of democracy but derives its power from its control of Russia's national resources.\n\n\n\nIt uses those resources to maintain itself in power, to personally enrich the rulers, and to exercise influence over its neighborhood, both in Europe and in the former Soviet sphere.\n\n\n\nBut the ideal of an open society is difficult to suppress and I have not given up hope.",

He's the new International Executive Director of environmental action group Greenpeace, and he takes on his role on the eve of the critical climate talks in Copenhagen.\n\n\n\nThe 44 year-old grew up in Johannesburg and had an early introduction to the world of activism.\n\n\n\n\"I was defiantly the product of the society I was born in, which was apartheid South Africa...I do think that many of us who might have exceptional or out-of-the-ordinary backgrounds are not because we ourselves are exceptional people but because we were born in context of adversity and been able to somehow rise above that adversity,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nNaidoo was arrested numerous times for civil disobedience against the apartheid regime during the 1980s. He eventually left for the UK in 1987 and earned a doctorate in political sociology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.\n\n\n\nAfter Nelson Mandela was released in 1990, Kumi returned to South Africa and worked with and founded a number of civil society NGOs. Until last year Naidoo was for 10 years the General Secretary of CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation.\n\n\n\nOne of the first high profile campaigns Naidoo worked on was Make Poverty History in 2005 that gained widespread coverage and a number of celebrity supporters.\n\n\n\nAfter several years in the anti-poverty movement, Naidoo has come to see that struggle against poverty and combating climate change are two-sides of same coin.\n\n\n\nSince becoming head of Greenpeace in November, Naidoo is focused on using his skills as an activist to move issues from the fringes into the mainstream.\n\n\n\n\"[Another] feature of activism is being able to choose the right tools and tactics for the right moment... If you can win through dialogue and engagement then that's great but sadly those with power in both government and business do not have the propensity to do the right thing unless they are pushed and that's why you have to have tools like non-violent direct action,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nConnecting individuals to ideas and in turn connecting those ideas to a greater audience is one of the things Naidoo is hoping to achieve in Copenhagen.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want history to judge us as sleepwalking into a crisis when all the scientific evidence is saying that we have to stop and take notice of the way that we are living on this planet.\n\n\n\n\"I feel that right now we are all at risk and being severely judged by future generation.\"\n\n\n\nWatch Kumi Naidoo on CNN's African Voices on Saturday, December 12, 11.30 and 18.30 GMT and Sunday, December 13, 17.00 GMT",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A total of seven cases of a previously undetected strain of swine flu have been confirmed in humans in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. None of the patients has had direct contact with pigs.\n\n\n\nSwine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them.\n\n\n\nFive of the cases have been found in California, and two have been found in Texas, near San Antonio, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's Interim Deputy Director for Science and Public Health Program.\n\n\n\nThe CDC reported Tuesday that two children in the San Diego, California, area, infected with a virus called swine influenza A H1N1, whose combination of genes has not been seen in flu viruses in either human or pigs before.\n\n\n\nThe patients range from age 9 to 54, Schuchat said. They include two 16-year-old boys who attend the same Texas school, and a father and daughter in California.\n\n\n\n\"The good news is that all seven of these patients have recovered,\" Schuchat said.\n\n\n\nThe first two cases were picked up through a special influenza monitoring program, with stations in San Diego and El Paso, Texas. The program aims to get a better sense of what strains exist and to detect new strains before they become widespread, the CDC said. Other cases emerged through routine and expanded surveillance.\n\n\n\nAt this point, the ability for the human influenza vaccine to protect against this new swine flu strain is unknown, and studies are ongoing, she said.\n\n\n\nThere is no danger from contracting the virus from eating pork products, Schuchat said.\n\n\n\nThe new virus has genes from North American swine and avian influenza, human influenza and swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe, said Nancy Cox, chief of the CDC's Influenza Division.\n\n\n\nSwine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza, according to the CDC. It does not normally inflect humans, but cases have occurred among people, especially those who have had direct exposure to pigs. There have also been cases in the past of one person spreading swine flu to other people, the CDC said.\n\n\n\nIn 1988, in an apparent swine flu infection in pigs in Wisconsin, there was antibody evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care workers who had contact with the patient, the CDC said.\n\n\n\nPerson-to-person transmission is believed to occur in a manner similar to the spread of the influenza virus: through infected people coughing and sneezing, the CDC said. People may contract swine flu by touching something with viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose.\n\n\n\nFrom December 2005 to February 2009, 12 cases of human infection with swine flu were documented.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of swine flu in humans are expected to resemble regular human seasonal influenza symptoms, including fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, and coughing, the CDC said. Other reported symptoms include runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n\n\nThe new strain of swine flu has been resistant to the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine, but has responded to the other licensed options: oseltamivir and zanamivir.\n\n\n\nThe CDC is working closely with health officials in California and Texas to learn more about the virus. The agency expects to find more cases, Schuchat said.\n\n\n\nIf swine flu can mutate to spread between humans, what does this mean for avian flu? Because of the virus subtype, it is less likely that avian flu would become transmissible from person to person, but still possible, said Dr. William Short at the division of infectious diseases at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nThe news is not cause for widespread panic, but people at risk -- those who live in or have traveled to the areas where patients live, or have been in contact with pigs -- should watch out for symptoms and get tested if they occur, Short said.\n\n\n\nThe three criteria for a pandemic are a new virus to which everybody is susceptible, the ability to spread from person to person readily, and wide geographic spread, said Dr. Jay Steinberg, infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia. The new strain of swine flu only meets one of these criteria: its novelty.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, bird flu meets two of the criteria: novelty and geographic spread.  If history is any indication, flu pandemics tend to occur once every 20 years or so, meaning we're actually due for one, he said. However, it is not likely to be the swine flu, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I can say with 100 percent confidence that a pandemic of a new flu strain will spread in humans,\" Steinberg said. \"What I can't say is when it will occur.\"",

  "context": "NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- A quiet rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" capped an emotional candlelight vigil Monday night for slain Yale University student Annie Le, whose body was found on what was to have been her wedding day.\n\n\n\nStudents at Yale attend a candlelight vigil for Annie Le Monday night.\n\n\n\nSeveral hundred people turned out on the Yale campus for the vigil, crying and hugging each other. Le's roommate, Natalie Powers, said the 24-year-old graduate student in pharmacology \"was as good a human being as you'd ever hope to meet.\"\n\n\n\n\"She was also really tenacious and had a sense of humor that was never far away, and she was tougher than you'd think by just looking at her,\" Powers said.\n\n\n\n\"That this horrible tragedy happened at all is incomprehensible. But that it happened to her I think is infinitely more so. It seems completely senseless.\"\n\n\n\nConnecticut state medical examiners announced Monday that the body found in a Yale medical research building over the weekend was that of Le, who had been missing for nearly a week. Her body was found Sunday hidden in a basement wall. Bloody clothes were found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling elsewhere in the same building, investigators said.\n\n\n\nLe was last seen entering the building Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\nThomas Kaplan, editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, said Le \"really had everything going for her.\"\n\n\n\n\"She was a top scholar. She was very outgoing, a warm person,\" Kaplan said. \"You know, she was diminutive in stature, but certainly not in personality. And that's what I think just makes this so sad for everyone, regardless of whether you knew her. It's just a tragedy.\"\n\n\n\nLe's death is being investigated as a homicide, but Connecticut medical examiners released no further information beyond the identification.\n\n\n\nA candlelight vigil in her honor was scheduled for Monday evening on the campus.\n\n\n\nA Yale professor said on Monday that the building has good security and only certain people can enter, let alone access certain areas. Professor Gary Rudnick, who interviewed Le when she applied for admission to the graduate program in pharmacology, said it gives him the sense that there could be a \"murderer among us.\"\n\n\n\nNo suspects are in custody, but investigators are questioning several people in the case, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said.  Watch a report about the case \u00bb\n\n\n\nKaplan said Le's killing has left Yale students shocked and wary. \"Only Yalies had access to that basement, and that seems to point to someone in our community being involved in this,\" Kaplan said. \"That's what is so frightening.\"\n\n\n\nAuthorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they may have belonged. Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the blood-stained clothes.\n\n\n\nKaplan said a Yale police official told the newspaper the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building.\n\n\n\nAt a meeting Monday for members of the campus community, Yale officials discussed security and provided an update on the investigation. A faculty member and a student who attended the meeting told CNN that Yale officials said police have narrowed down suspects.\n\n\n\nSecurity cameras captured video of Le as she entered the four-story lab building at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus, six days ago. After poring over hours of surveillance tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building.\n\n\n\nRudnick described security in the building as \"very good.\" It had restricted access, and simply having a Yale ID card was not enough to get in, he said. Within the building, one had to have special access to enter certain areas, he said.\n\n\n\nLe was to be married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University.\n\n\n\n\"Annie has been planning this wedding for over a year with John, and she was very excited. She's been doing a countdown to her wedding day,\" Jennifer Simpson, a friend in Sacramento, told the CBS \"Early\" show. \"She was doing weather patterns to make sure that the weather would be perfect on her wedding day. She just wanted everything to be perfect, everything down to table napkins, to flowers. Annie was very, very excited about this day.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators searched a waste facility Sunday that normally handles garbage from the Yale lab, said William Reiner of the FBI's New Haven office. The search took place at the Resources Recovery Authority landfill in Hartford, near New Haven.\n\n\n\n\"In a situation like this, it's common for us to follow the trash,\" Reiner said.\n\n\n\nYale University President Richard Levin, in a statement to the campus community, said, \"Our hearts go out to Annie Le's family, fianc\u00e9 and friends.\"\n\n\n\nThe school sent out information Monday from Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer saying, \"We are cooperating in all possible ways with the police to ensure they find every shred of physical evidence in the building so they can solve this horrible crime without delay. When the building does reopen, there will be extra security both inside and outside the facility for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\n\nLorimer added, \"To augment the substantial security already in place at the Medical School, Yale moved last week to increase security and police patrols on the streets in the area and to add a new bicycle patrol. Yale also added security personnel inside Sterling Hall of Medicine, where Annie Le had her lab.\"\n\n\n\nThe school has made grief counselors available, as well as a 24-hour help line number. \"The university chaplain's office is available to offer pastoral counseling and can put members of the community in contact with those of many faiths and denominations,\" the message from Lorimer said.\n\n\n\nLe, a resident of Placerville, California, seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town.\n\n\n\nIn February, she compared crime and safety at Yale to other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school.\n\n\n\nAmong the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person.\n\n\n\nAnd she practiced what she preached, Simpson told the \"Early\" show.\n\n\n\n\"Annie always made sure she was safe,\" Simpson said. \"She doesn't walk around at night by herself. If she had to work late, she would make sure someone could come pick her up or walk with her.\"\n\n\n\nWhen she walked over to the research building on Tuesday, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office.\n\n\n\nVanessa Flores, Le's former roommate, wondered whether the magazine article had something to do with Le's death.\n\n\n\n\"The only thing I can possibly think of right now is maybe a psychopath, an antisocial person who -- I don't know -- maybe got upset about what she wrote about back in February about not being safe, and just kind of wanted to prove her wrong.\"\n\n\n\nLe, originally from California, graduated from Union Mine High School in 2003, where she was named \"Best of the Best,\" and \"Most Likely To Be The Next Einstein.\"\n\n\n\n\"She was very smart, well-rounded, liked by peers and very involved in school,\"  high school principal Tony DeVille told CNN affiliate WFSB.\n\n\n\nLe set the bar high for herself, writing in her profile for the National Institutes of Health that she was interested in studying and researching regenerative medicine and hoped to remain working at at NIH or become a professor.\n\n\n\nHer friends remembered her as one of the nicest people they had ever met.\n\n\n\nLaurel Griffeath, a high school friend, told NBC's \"Today\" show in Le had a beaming personality matched with impressive intelligence, a girl who \"had it all.\"\n\n\n\n\"Annie was just an amazing person, and I know that when tragedies happen, people always say that, but she truly was,\" Griffeath told the \"Today\" show. \"She was probably the most brilliant person I've ever met in my life, but what made her more amazing was that there was an intersection of intelligence and personality and ability and she worked hard and she was great with people and she cared about people and she was funny and she didn't sacrifice one part of her life for another like a lot of people kind of seem to.\n\n\n\n\"She just really kind of had it all. She was really amazing.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Susan Candiotti, Mary Snow and LaNeice Collins contributed to this report.",

  "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi police and soldiers on Saturday launched major raids in a once-notorious insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad.\n\n\n\nSaturday's raids in Falluja by Iraqi forces were similar to U.S.-led sweeps in the city in 2004, shown here.\n\n\n\nA police official in the Anbar province city of Falluja told CNN that a large number of security forces were scouring its Sinaie district for an array of weapons -- machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms.\n\n\n\nThe Sinaie area, in Falluja's southeastern section, is an industrial district with factories, scrap yards and large, abandoned yards.\n\n\n\nThe area used to be a stronghold of the insurgency in Falluja until the militants were driven out in major military operations five years ago.\n\n\n\nAt that time, the U.S.-led offensive was largely in response to the brutal ambush, killing and mutilation of four U.S. security contractors. Their charred bodies were left dangling from a bridge over the Euphrates River in spring 2004.\n\n\n\nIn November of that year, U.S. and Iraqi forces attacked insurgents in Falluja, killing about 1,200 militants. Eight Iraqi soldiers and 51 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, died in urban combat, according to the Pentagon. About 95 percent of Falluja's population was displaced.\n\n\n\nFalluja is about 37 miles, or 60 kilometers, west of Baghdad\n\n\n\nAfter the city was pacified, the United States committed more than $200 million to reconstruction projects there, and changes became evident.\n\n\n\nSmall cafes and grocery stores lined the streets once dusty and abandoned. Iraqis in Falluja got back to the rhythms of everyday life: They worked, shopped -- and rebuilt.\n\n\n\nAs fragile security gains took root, American military officials marveled at the resurgent city of several hundred thousand.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, a police official denied reports that armed groups were trying to re-establish a foothold in the area. The U.S. military said Marines and police in the nearby town of Karma were also participating in a combined cache sweep.\n\n\n\nViolence has dropped in Iraq, and President Obama's administration has been gearing up to withdraw U.S. troops. The U.S. military continues to be on guard for flare-ups in violence and insurgent activity.\n\n\n\nThe vast and predominantly Sunni Arab Anbar province was a battleground between the U.S. military and al Qaeda in Iraq during the earlier years of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nBut the insurgents eventually lost ground when a grass-roots movement called \"the awakening\" emerged. The tribe-based awakening forces rejected al Qaeda in Iraq and turned their allegiances toward the U.S. and Iraqi government.\n\n\n\nWhile the awakening doesn't have clout in Falluja, there are pockets of support just outside the city, as well as in the rest of the province.\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda in Iraq's strongest presence in the country is now in the Mosul area, in Nineveh province, north of Baghdad.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- Somalia said a senior al Qaeda operative tied to several attacks in East Africa was killed Monday in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia.\n\n\n\nSaleh ali Saleh Nabhan, pictured on the FBI's Web site, reportedly was tied to al Qaeda's East Africa operations.\n\n\n\nIntelligence sources have confirmed to the Somali government that Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan was killed, Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gelle said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\"We welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers, and they are unwanted and unwelcome in Somalia,\" Gelle said.\n\n\n\nNabhan's death will have \"a major impact\" on al Qaeda's operations in the Horn of Africa, according to one regional analyst.\n\n\n\nU.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car Monday in southern Somalia, killing several people, including one they believed was Nabhan, U.S. officials told CNN earlier.\n\n\n\nNabhan, 30, was born in Kenya and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, according to the sources. More than 200 were killed, and 4,000 wounded in those attacks, most of them Kenyans.\n\n\n\nThe United States targeted Nabhan in an airstrike in southern Somalia near the Kenyan border in March 2008, U.S. officials said at the time.\n\n\n\nIn February 2006, the FBI announced that Nabhan was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa, Kenya.\n\n\n\nTen Kenyans and three Israelis -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa's Paradise Hotel in November 2002.\n\n\n\nThe bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet, which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama signed off on Monday's operation, a senior U.S. official said. The United States had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that Nabhan was in the area, the U.S. officials said.\n\n\n\nThe officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on Monday's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore, while the ship kept watch on the operation, one of the sources said. The warship was ready to rescue the American troops if they got into trouble.\n\n\n\nFarmers in the southeastern town of Barawe, Somalia, said they witnessed the assault. They said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died. The witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter.\n\n\n\nA U.S. official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification.\n\n\n\nNabhan is believed to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul, who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda's East African operations, a senior U.S. official said last year.\n\n\n\n\"He was certainly one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa,\" said Rashid Abdi, a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, an independent advisory and analysis organization.\n\n\n\nNabhan \"has been living in the shadows\" in Somalia and not much is known about his recent activity, Abdi said.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on al Qaeda than on Al-Shabaab,\" he said, referring to the Islamist militia in Somalia that has ties to al Qaeda. \"He is a man with an important organizational memory, and if a key figure like him is killed, it always has a major impact.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Shabaab is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of its al Qaeda ties.\n\n\n\nThere are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n\n\nCIA Director Leon Panetta recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives.\n\n\n\nJournalist Mohammed Amiin Adow and CNN's David McKenzie, Barbara Starr and Ed Henry contributed to this report.",

Christopher Heathscott.\n\nAbout 50 soldiers also helped with security and food distribution.\n\nGov. Mike Beebe planned to fly over Mena on Friday afternoon.\n\nMena, population 6,000, took a heavy hit on the west side of town, as the storm swept through downtown before heading up state Highway 71, said Tommy Jackson from the state Department of Emergency Management.\n\n\"It looks like a war zone out here,\" said James Reeves, also from the department.  Watch scenes of devastation in Mena \u00bb\n\nThe tornado damaged the county hospital, Mena City Hall, a middle school, churches, a library, the Masonic lodge and the courthouse -- which houses the 911 emergency dispatch center and a detention center, Reeves said. He said electricity and gas were out in the western half of the city.\n\nTwo plants at an industrial park were destroyed, said reporter Charles Crowson of CNN affiliate KTHV-TV. He said utility crews were trying to stop a gas leak there.\n\nPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd told Crowson the county detention center was \"uninhabitable.\" There were 18 inmates in the jail at the time of the tornado, and they were moved to neighboring jurisdictions, he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video\n\nThere were 24 reports of tornadoes in the area Thursday night, said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano, and wind gusts reached more than 70 mph.\n\n\"So a significant severe weather event last night, and we expect similar action later on today, although it's all moving to the east,\" he said Friday morning. \"It went from Oklahoma across the border toward Arkansas.\"\n\nWinds will continue to be gusty until later in the afternoon, Marciano said.\n\nAs the storms moved east, thunderstorms were predicted, and there was a chance for more tornadoes. Large hail and damaging winds were predicted for the Southeast later Friday.\n\nIn Mena, officials set up three shelters, but fewer than 50 people had sought refuge in them. In this rural community, most people are staying with friends and family, Reeves said.\n\nAll three victims were elderly, officials said. A man and a woman died when houses collapsed, and another woman died after being struck by debris.\n\nBeebe sent 30 National Guard soldiers to the town Thursday, and 20 more are expected Friday.\n\nCNN's Melissa Roberts and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",

According to the magazine, there will be enough material to provide insulation for 60 houses.\n\n\n\nThe jeans will be turned over to Cotton Inc., which collects used denim for natural fiber insulation made without carcinogens or chemical irritants. Paula Rosario, vice president of consumer marketing for the company, said that the new record \"certainly attests to the civic-mindedness of today's children.\"\n\n\n\nThe ceremony unveiling the denim display also honored 9-year-old Erek Hansen, who collected nearly 1,700 jeans. The elementary school student from Curtice, Ohio, said that his friends and classmates \"were happy to help the environment.\"\n\n\n\nHansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans.

  "context": "(CNN)  -- Inspectors have found \"nothing unusual\" in the rest of Southwest Airlines' fleet of 737-300s after a football-sized hole in one of the jets forced an emergency landing, an airline spokeswoman said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe breach in the aircraft's fuselage caused a loss of cabin pressure. No passengers were injured.\n\n\n\nThe airline inspected its roughly 200 Boeing 737-300s overnight following the incident that forced Southwest Flight 2294 to make an emergency landing in Charleston, West Virginia.\n\n\n\nA sudden drop in cabin pressure caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy, but there were no injuries among the 126 passengers or the five-member crew.\n\n\n\nMarilee McInnis, a Southwest spokeswoman, said the jets were inspected during non-operational hours overnight, and the cause of the incident remained unknown Tuesday morning. The airline is working closely with the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the matter, she said.\n\n\n\nFlight 2294 was at 34,000 feet, en route from Nashville, Tennessee, to Baltimore, Maryland, when the incident happened, McInnis said.  See map of flight path \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"About 45 minutes into the flight, there was a loud pop. No one really knew what it was,\" passenger Steve Hall told CNN Radio.  Watch as passenger describes watching the hole form \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe plane landed in Charleston at 5:10 p.m. after the crew reported the sudden drop in cabin pressure, which caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy.\n\n\n\n\"We were seated about two rows back from the wing, and four rows back you heard this loud rush and your ears popped, and you could tell that part of the inside was trying to pull out,\" passenger Sheryl Bryant told CNN affiliate WBAL-TV upon arriving in Baltimore aboard a replacement plane.\n\n\n\n\"And it was crazy -- the oxygen masks dropped,\" she continued. She put her mask on her face, then helped her 4- and 6-year-old children with theirs, she said.\n\n\n\nBryant tried to stay calm and reassure her children, she said.  Watch Bryant's account of acting brave \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"My kids and I, we prayed, and then we said, you know, life will be fine,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBryant praised the flight crew and ground personnel for keeping passengers informed and for giving clear instructions.\n\n\n\n\"We have a tremendous talent represented in the pilots and the flight crew,\" another passenger, Pastor Alvin Kibble, told WBAL-TV. \"I think we need to value them far more than perhaps what we do. It's very easy for us to begin to take things for granted.\"\n\n\n\nThe damaged aircraft was still parked at Charleston's Yeager Airport on Tuesday, when NTSB officials arrived to inspect the plane, airport spokesman Brian Belcher said. A complete inspection could take one to two days, and investigators are expected to interview the passengers and crew as well, he said.\n\n\n\nThe airline is \"doing things\" for the affected passengers on Monday's flight, but McInnis would not say whether they would receive refunds.\n\n\n\nBoth the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, FAA spokeswoman Holly Baker said.\n\n\n\n\"There is no responsible way to speculate as to a cause at this point,\" Southwest said in a statement Monday night.\n\n\n\n\"We have safety procedures in place, and they were followed in this instance to get all passengers and crew safely on the ground,\" the airline said. \"Reports we have are that our passengers were calm and that our pilots and flight attendants did a great job getting the aircraft on the ground safely.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Shawn Nottingham and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.",

One person on the ground was also killed.\n\n\n\nFederal investigators held hearings on Capitol Hill last month on the cause of the crash but have not concluded their inquiry.\n\n\n\nSeveral shortcomings of the crew came to light during the National Transportation and Safety Board hearings when it was revealed that Colgan Air Capt. Marvin Renslow failed to reveal two pilot exam failures in his job application.\n\n\n\nTestimony at the hearings also revealed that fatigue apparently contributed to the failure of Renslow and First Officer Rebecca Shaw to save the plane as it approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport.\n\n\n\nUSA Today newspaper reviewed the safety board's accident reports over the past 10 years and found that in nearly every serious accident involving a regional airline during that time, at least one of the pilots had failed multiple skill tests.\n\n\n\n\"In eight of the nine accidents during that time, which killed 137 people, pilots had a history of failing two or more 'check rides,' tests by federal or airline inspectors of pilots' ability to fly and respond to emergencies,\" USA Today reported Sunday. \"In the lone case in which pilots didn't have multiple failures since becoming licensed, the co-pilot was fired after the nonfatal crash for falsifying his job application.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to reviewing regional airlines' training programs, Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood have called on representatives from major air carriers, their regional partners, aviation industry groups and labor to participate in a \"call to action\" in Washington on Monday, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation news release.\n\n\n\nThe review will address pilot training, cockpit discipline and other flight safety issues, the release said.",

  "context": "(Skiing Magazine) -- When it comes to ski-equipment meccas, there's Park City, Utah; Boulder, Colorado; and, Vancouver, Canada. Home to Arc'teryx, Westcomb, and Prior, these Vancouver-based brands are leading the charge in innovative gear technology and design.\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Arc'teryx, a local company that got its start in 1991 making rock-climbing harnesses, and has since evolved into an industry leader turning out stellar outdoor apparel, equipment, and accessories year after year. \"Our brand was born and raised and is still growing its roots in Vancouver,\" explains Arc'teryx CEO Tyler Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We rely on our local contacts, a group of hardcore athletes, and our employees -- we're all gear junkies -- to give immediate feedback to help us grow and develop the brand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing state-of-the-art materials, construction methods, and a style-y aesthetic, Arc'teryx appeals equally to hardcore skiers as to mainstream mountain lovers. In fact, Arc'teryx's gear is so good, some of Vancouver's police are now outfitted in the brand's LEAF (Law Enforcement Armed Forces) line. And with two full-time colorists on staff, the brand has revolutionized the world of color in ski apparel. Gone are the days of black, yellow, and red jackets \u00e0 la North Face 1995; in are outer shells splashed with shades like Big Sky blue and Bud green.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not just the city's proximity to the outdoors that influences local gear companies; it's also Vancouver's thriving cosmopolitanism, fashion scene, and underground culture. Alan Yiu, CEO and creative director of Westcomb, a local ski apparel brand, just looks to his city for ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I look at architecture and buildings. Anything that makes me stop in my tracks and wonder what the process was to create it is a source of inspiration to me.\" And Westcomb's vibe reflects Yiu's -- and Vancouver's -- modern sensibility: funky, fresh, and sleek.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkiing Magazine: Why you should care about the Olympics\n\n\n\n\n\nVancouver is also home to award-winning \"microbrew\" ski and snowboard manufacturer Prior. What started in 1990 with founder Chris Prior making snowboards in his North Vancouver garage has turned into one of the world's top producers of handcrafted snow equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkiing Magazine: Why you should care about the Olympics (counter-argument)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000 Prior moved its factory to Whistler, and having one of North America's premiere resorts in its backyard translates into primo powder skis and boards made for big-mountain ripping. Want to build the ski of your dreams? Prior can customize tricked-out features, graphics, and top sheets. A tour of the factory in Whistler makes for a killer off-piste adventure. However, if the snow is good, you may find the place empty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough it's doubtful the IOC had local gear companies in mind when it picked Vancouver to host the 2010 Winter Games, it's no coincidence that the city claims Olympic-caliber gear as its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2010 Skiing Magazine.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Venus Williams is most often seen wiping perspiration from her brow as she thunders around the court contesting championship tennis matches.\n\n\n\nVenus Williams steps off the tennis court and into the pool in a series of photos to be featured in Italian Marie Claire.\n\n\n\nThese photos show the world number six in a more reflective mood, posing for a 16-page fashion spread in the Italian edition of Marie Claire.\n\n\n\nThey were taken in Miami, Florida in December last year by her friend and photographer Koto Bolofo.\n\n\n\n\"I love working with Koto,\" Venus told CNN in an interview for \"Revealed.\" \"I think he's my biggest fan and he believes in me, I'm not sure why, but he does so I've got to accept that,\" she laughed.\n\n\n\nThey planned to shoot 20 outfits in one day, a hectic schedule that included one photo that had been two years in the making.  See video of the photo shoot \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"I've got it pictured in my mind that she's going to be playing tennis underwater,\" Bolofo told CNN.\n\n\n\nWhen the sun finally emerged from behind a cloud, Bolofo ordered Venus into her bathers.\n\n\n\n\"I'm excited it's my first underwater tennis venture, so I feel a little nervous, but I think I'll come through,\" Venus said.\n\n\n\n\"I want her smiling and making it look as if it's natural and it's not an effort,\" Bolofo explained. \"It's going to be whimsical and fun. That's the fun part of the shoot.\"\n\n\n\nFashion is an important part of Venus Williams' life. She has her own clothing company, EleVen, which produces tennis outfits and casual clothing.\n\n\n\nShe sketches ideas, but says she's not the chief designer, by any stretch. \"There are other people designing stuff. I couldn't do it on my own,\" she said, adding, \"I don't do technical drawing, I hated it in school. I refuse to do this on the computer. I'd rather just do it by hand.\"\n\n\n\nVenus' status in the ranks of the world's top tennis players gives her a unique position to be able to market her products and she often wears them on court.\n\n\n\nThen there's her interior design company; Venus launched V Starr Interiors while still in her early twenties.\n\n\n\nDespite her public business interests, Venus told CNN she's not interested in seizing the spotlight for any reason other than as one of the world's best tennis players.\n\n\n\n\"Fame has never been important to me. My goals have always been to excel in tennis, and to win championships. Fame has never been my focus and I don't really try to grow it at all,\" she said.\n\n\n\nVenus' relaxed attitude has earned her respect beyond the world of tennis. Hip hop star Wyclef Jean released a song in her honor last year called \"I'm Ready.\"  Listen to the song \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"[It's like] when a painter is inspired,\" Jean told CNN. \"When I'm inspired by an individual I just write a song about them ... I said her name is Venus, ruler of the universe.\"\n\n\n\nVenus was thrilled. \"I've got it on my computer, all the different instrumentals, the different versions, the different cuts. I love it,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n\nVenus Williams is back on court this week at the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Naturally, she's hoping to win after a disappointing early exit from the Australian Open in January.\n\n\n\nWhile tennis remains her prime obsession, Venus told CNN it's not the most important thing in her life.\n\n\n\n\"I would say definitely the most important thing in my life is growing spiritually. And doing what God requires of me -- that's always a learning experience day in and day out,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWatch Venus Williams on Revealed this week at the times below:\n\n\n\nALL TIMES GMT Wednesday, February 18: 0930, 1830 Saturday, February 21: 0830, 1900 Sunday, February 22: 0530, 1830 Monday, February 23: 0400",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A police officer chasing a theft suspect was fatally shot Thursday night by another officer after he failed to drop his weapon when ordered to, authorities said.\n\n\n\nOfficer Omar Edwards, 25, was not wearing a bulletproof vest and did not fire a shot, authorities say.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said Officer Omar Edwards, 25, was shot three times. The incident is under investigation.\n\n\n\nEdwards was in plainclothes and carrying a handgun as he chased the suspect past a police car.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said the officer who shot him said he didn't realize Edwards was a police officer.\n\n\n\nEdwards had just left the Housing Bureau Station House on East 124th Street, said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly at a news conference Friday. As Edwards approached his vehicle, he saw a man rummaging through it.\n\n\n\nEdwards took out his gun -- a Smith and Wesson 9 mm -- and chased the alleged thief, 43-year-old Miguel Santiago, said NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a police cruiser with a sergeant and two officers, including Officer Andrew Dunton, had just turned onto 125th Street from 1st Avenue.\n\n\n\nSantiago ran in front of the unmarked vehicle as it approached halfway up the block and the vehicle stopped.\n\n\n\nThe officer in the front passenger seat got out of the vehicle and shouted for Edwards to stop running and drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kelly, the officers reported that, after the command was given, Edwards turned toward Dunton with his gun in his hand.  Watch Commissioner Kelly describe the shooting \u00bb\n\n\n\nDunton fired his Glock 9 mm six times, hitting Edwards three of those times -- once in the left arm, once in the left side and once in the back, according to police. Emergency crews responding to the scene found Edwards wearing a police academy T-shirt under his clothes and found his police shield and ID in his front left pants pocket, according to Browne.\n\n\n\nEdwards, who lived in Brooklyn, was recently married and had two small children, according to CNN affiliate WABC-TV in New York.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, his relatives remembered him as a good person who achieved what he set out to do.\n\n\n\n\"He was a wonderful, wonderful child from when he was small,\" his father, Ricardo Edwards, told WABC.\n\n\n\n\"His desire was always to be a policeman and to play football,\" his uncle, Jerome Harding told the New York TV station. \"And he did accomplish both, because he plays for the Police Department.\"\n\n\n\nEdwards was pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital at 11:21 p.m. Thursday, according to Kelly.\n\n\n\n\"Tragic accidents like this are another reminder of the dangers our police officers often face as they keep our city the safest big city in the nation,\" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday.\n\n\n\n\"Rest assured we will find out exactly what happened here, see what we can learn from it so it may never happen again. All the city's prayers are with Omar Edwards and his family.\"\n\n\n\nFive eyewitnesses, along with 20 people who reported hearing gunshots, were interviewed by police.\n\n\n\nThe officer who fired the shots has 4\u00bd  years' experience, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe officers involved have been placed on administrative duties while the shooting is investigated. Police later arrested the alleged thief on suspicion of breaking into Edwards' car.",

  "context": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Even before one reaches the front door of Canon's headquarters in Tokyo, one can sense the virtual stampede of employees pouring out of the building exactly at 5:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nJapan's birth rate of 1.34 is below the level needed to maintain the country's population.\n\n\n\nIn a country where 12-hour workdays are common, the electronics giant has taken to letting its employees leave early twice a week for a rather unusual reason: to encourage them to have more babies.\n\n\n\nJapan is in the midst of an unprecedented recession, so corporations are being asked to work toward fixing another major problem: the country's low birthrate. Tell us what you think\n\n\n\nAt 1.34, the birthrate is well below the 2.0 needed to maintain Japan's population, according to the country's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\n\n\nKeidanren, Japan's largest business group, with 1,300 major international corporations as members, has issued a plea to its members to let workers go home early to spend time with their families and help Japan with its pressing social problem. Watch more on this story\n\n\n\nOne reason for the low birth rate is the 12-hour workday. But there are several other factors compounding the problem -- among them, the high cost of living, and social rigidity toward women and parenting.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Japan's population is aging at a faster pace than any other country in the world.\n\n\n\nAnalysts say the world's second-largest economy faces its greatest threat from its own social problems, rather than outside forces. And the country desperately needs to make some fixes to its current social and work structures, sociologists say.\n\n\n\nThe 5:30 p.m. lights-out program is one simple step toward helping address the population problem. It also has an added benefit: Amid the global economic downturn the company can slash overtime across the board twice a week.\n\n\n\n\"It's great that we can go home early and not feel ashamed,\" said employee Miwa Iwasaki.",

Under the rule, NATO troops have 96 hours to either turn over detainees to Afghan authorities or release them -- a rule put in effect to avoid Abu Ghraib-like offenses.\n\n\n\n\"We are currently reviewing the 96-hour rule, but have yet to make decisions about how we wish to proceed in light of some of the obvious problems associated with it,\" Geoff Morrell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told CNN in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"As soon as we have something concrete to say about our way ahead with respect to this aspect of detainee operations, we will of course share it with the Afghan government, our allies in the fight and, of course, the public at large.\"\n\n\n\nNATO forces fighting in Afghanistan have operated under the 96-hour rule since December 2005. But soldiers interviewed by CNN said it could put them in danger because it forces them to release detainees in a short time span.\n\n\n\nThe rule, contained in a directive outlining International Security Assistance Force detention policies, resulted from consultations with U.S. military and Afghan commanders, said James Appathurai, spokesman for NATO.\n\n\n\nCNN's Abbie Boudreau's blog: At the 96th hour\n\n\n\n\"We have to balance the requirement for protecting our soldiers with the reality that Afghanistan is a sovereign country, that there must be limits on the time we can detain Afghans before handing them over to Afghan authorities,\" Appathurai said. \"The Afghan authorities can also talk with detainees to extract information. It is not as though the interrogation needs to end when we hand them over to the Afghan authorities.\"\n\n\n\nGen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. Central Command, however, said he was not convinced that 96 hours was enough time -- particularly for high-value targets.\n\n\n\n\"Ninety-six hours is not enough if you are going to ensure that they stay behind bars, obviously,\" he told CNN after a question and answer session in Atlanta. \"Again, there has to be a process by which the individuals that need to be detained are detained, or that if they're handed off to Afghan officials that there's confidence in the system working.\"\n\n\n\nAppathurai announced the rule in December 2005.\n\n\n\nAt CNN's request, NATO compiled statistics on what has happened to detainees since the agency began keeping such records in 2006. Under the 96-hour rule, about one in four detainees has been released.\n\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who was in Afghanistan last year and who is a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, said the rule puts soldiers in danger.\n\n\n\n\"The one story I hear told over and over and over again [is] 'Senator Graham, this policy makes no sense. It is putting our folks at risk for no higher purpose. It needs to change,'\" Graham said.\n\n\n\n\"So the level of frustration is now turning to anger, and quite frankly, here's what's going to start happening -- we're going to take less prisoners. They're going to start shooting these folks.\"\n\n\n\nGraham said he is not satisfied about how the rule was first implemented.\n\n\n\n\"I've been asking for months now, 'Who the hell made this rule up? Why did you pick 96 hours versus 80 hours or a hundred hours? What's the source document? What analysis went into whether or not this is an effective tool to deal with problems that we have in Afghanistan?'\" he said. \"I can't get anyone to tell me how this thing was formed, whose idea it was and how it became policy.\"\n\n\n\nThe case of Roger Hill, a former Army captain who received a general discharge for his role in the questioning of 12 detainees, prompted CNN's investigation of the 96-hour rule. Those 12 men had worked on his base in Afghanistan, including one who was his trusted interpreter.\n\n\n\nHill was the commander in charge of the Wardak Province in eastern Afghanistan for much of 2008. He said he feared the enemy was tracking his every move and suspected an inside threat.\n\n\n\n\"Out of a 90-man company, we had 30 wounded, to include two killed in action,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe told CNN that his headquarters sent a team to the base to detect possible spies. The team screened cell phone activity to find out which Afghan civilians working on the base might be working for the Taliban.\n\n\n\n\"It turned out that it wasn't just one or two or three, but we actually had a full dozen,\" Hill said.\n\n\n\nHill's trusted interpreter was one of them.\n\n\n\nAngry and frustrated that the interpreter might be sabotaging missions, Hill detained all 12 men in a small building on the base. When he took the men in the building, the 96-hour countdown began.\n\n\n\nThe rule is designed to give the Afghan government control over detainees and avoid abuses like what happened at the Iraqi prison Abu Ghraib in Baghdad.\n\n\n\nBut Hill said the rule does not work, and many times dangerous suspects are released because there's not enough time to gather evidence.\n\n\n\nThe other problem, he said, was that the evidence against the 12 men was too sensitive to hand over to the Afghans. Hill was ordered not to share classified intelligence with the Afghans for fear it could be used against U.S. soldiers in future battles.\n\n\n\n\"So we're in this Catch-22, where they're saying, 'Hey we'll take these guys off your hands, but give us the evidence,'\" Hill said. \"And I'm saying, 'I can't do that because there are technologies and techniques utilized that I can't sacrifice for this one particular case that will be used again in a fight later on.' 'Well, if you can't give us the evidence, then we can't take these guys off your hands.' So, the clock continues to tick.\"\n\n\n\nAs the clock ticked toward the 96-hour NATO deadline, Hill made a decision that would cost him his military career.\n\n\n\n\"I decided that I needed to break protocol and interrogate them myself,\" he said. \"I took three gentlemen outside, sat them down, walked away, and fired my weapon into the ground three times, hoping that the men inside, left to their own imagination, would think that they really needed to talk.\"\n\n\n\nHill walked back inside.\n\n\n\n\"And sure enough, some of the detainees started to talk,\" Hill said.\n\n\n\nWhat the detainees told him was enough to convince the Afghans to take all 12 men into custody, including Hill's interpreter.\n\n\n\nHill said he felt he had made the correct decision to protect his soldiers, but the Army charged him with detainee abuse, leading to his discharge from the military.\n\n\n\nAnd the 12 men ended up being released, despite the confessions, according to Army investigators. No one knows where they are now and what they're doing.",

The employee did not mean to offend although there were some employees that were rightfully offended by it,\" Nantel said.\n\n\n\nMyers and the other judges \"noted his costume for originality.\"\n\n\n\n\"There were a couple of people who were offended,\" Nantel said. \"When it was confirmed through a conversation with the employee that he was wearing make-up,\" Nantel said, the employee was counseled and Myers sent out a note to employees apologizing.\n\n\n\nIn a November 2 email to ICE employees, Myers wrote, \"It is now clear that, however unintended, a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive. While we were all thrilled to be a part of the CFC fundraising effort, I and the senior management at ICE deeply regret that this happened.\"\n\n\n\nShe reminded all employees to be compliant with the department's diversity training requirement.\n\n\n\nMyers has served as head of ICE since January of 2006 but is still awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\n\n\nAn ICE congressional liaison said ICE officials briefed congressional staffers about the costume party this week as a courtesy. But at least one congressional staffer said they approached ICE after receiving an anonymous fax about the incident.\n\n\n\nMyers called House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, about the incident and is expected to meet with him before the end of the week, a Thompson spokeswoman told CNN.\n\n\n\nMyers also contacted the National Association of African-Americans in the Department of Homeland Security. In a letter to NAADHS members, the group's vice president, Sjon Shavers, said the group \"appreciates (Myers) reaching out to us so quickly in order to keep us apprised of the matter and we commend her on moving so swiftly toward appropriate corrective action.\"\n\n\n\nAs head of ICE, Myers heads the law enforcement agency charged with enforcing immigration law inside the United States. It is the second largest investigative agency in the federal government, with more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 investigators.\n\n\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff \"supports the actions that Assistant Secretary Myers has taken,\" DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner said. \"We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior at DHS.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Secretary has asked for an inquiry into the facts surrounding the incident. Once the facts have been determined, we will take all necessary and appropriate actions,\" Keehner said. E-mail to a friend",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The mysterious deaths of 21 prized polo horses Sunday at a club in Florida provides a peek inside the private world of a sport that generally is off limits to all but the very wealthy.\n\n\n\nThe Lechuza Caracas polo team may not recover from the loss of 21 ponies for years, a polo executive says.\n\n\n\nThe University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville and the state-run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando are conducting necropsies on the animals.\n\n\n\nInitial tests failed to reveal a cause, said Liz Compton, a representative of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Tissues, organ samples and blood are now being screened for toxic agents, she said.\n\n\n\nScientists have ruled out any contagious disease because the animals died so quickly, said state Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Fagan.\n\n\n\nAuthorities initially requested necropsies for only the eight horses that were insured, according to Sarah Carey, a representative of the veterinary school, which got the bodies of 15 horses.\n\n\n\nLater, the order was expanded to all 15 horses, she said.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Polo Association is among the parties cooperating in the investigation.\n\n\n\n\"In the meantime, we all mourn the loss of these horses,\" U.S. Polo Association Executive Director Peter Rizzo said in a news release. \"There are no words to describe the grief and sadness shared by everyone -- particularly the devastated owners of those magnificent horses.\"  Watch what investigators are studying \u00bb\n\n\n\nPlayers form strong emotional bonds with the horses they ride, said John Wash, operations president of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida, where the horses fell ill.\n\n\n\n\"I've heard a couple of polo players who were affected with this loss the other day, a couple of them I don't think have left their house since Sunday night,\" Wash said. \"There were a lot of tears there -- these big, tough guys just on their hands and knees, crying over what happened.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Open Polo Championship that was interrupted by the tragedy will resume Wednesday with semifinal matches, Wash said. Lechuza Caracas, the team whose horses died, was offered spare mounts from other competitors so they could remain in the competition, but the devastated team chose to withdraw, Wash said.\n\n\n\nThe Wellington tournament is one of the sport's three major championships, on a par with the U.S. Open in tennis or golf.\n\n\n\nAuthorities say they believe that the competition facility is safe for the other horses and that whatever killed the 21 horses entered their bodies away from the site.\n\n\n\nFifteen of the animals fell ill shortly before they were to compete Sunday; some died immediately and others lingered for almost an hour. Six others died overnight Sunday to Monday as they were kept in the same trailer in Wellington.\n\n\n\nAnimals are not kept overnight at the competition site, so no special precautions are in place regarding food, water or bedding, Wash said.\n\n\n\nOrganizers are planning a short memorial and laying of wreaths in honor of the horses, he said.\n\n\n\nGrief counselors are on hand at the facility to help employees deal with the trauma, Wash said.\n\n\n\n\"The scene can be described as almost like an airplane crash that involved not human life, but horses,\" he said. \"It was horrific.\"\n\n\n\nPolo ponies in the United States are not drug-tested, but the U.S. Polo Association has been considering taking up the practice for several years, Wash said.\n\n\n\n\"People are calling for reform, and maybe that needs to happen, but until toxicology reports come back, and autopsy reports, we don't even know if [Sunday's incident is] anything related to that.\"\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States has no record of abuse of polo ponies, but that may be a function of the sport's exclusive nature, society spokeswoman Holly Hazard said.\n\n\n\n\"We are learning about this, as is everyone else,\" she said. \"It may be that perhaps because it's not televised or not as popular as other sports, it's not something that either our constituents or our program is particularly focused on.\n\n\n\n\"But if there are either performance-enhancing drugs or some problem that is associated with this, we will investigate and we will offer a reward to bring whoever is responsible to justice.\"\n\n\n\nKeith Dane, director of the Humane Society's equine protection program, was en route to Florida on Tuesday to interview people involved in the incident and keep an eye on the investigation, Hazard said.\n\n\n\nNo evidence has been brought forth suggesting someone deliberately poisoned the animals.\n\n\n\n\"I guess everything's possible,\" Wash said. \"I've heard all different rumors. I don't know if I even want to go there and think about that.\"\n\n\n\nCompton, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services representative, said authorities have seen no evidence of criminal activity in the case.\n\n\n\n\"Clearly, law enforcement has gotten involved, given the complexity and the scope of the deaths, and they are fact-finding and gathering information, and once we have a specific cause of death, then they can determine where their investigation will go,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe devastated team, Lechuza Caracas, is one of the top teams in the world. The loss could set it back for years, Wash said.\n\n\n\n\"It's just like baseball or basketball or football,\" he said. \"You're taking years of grooming, training, nurturing to create, really, a first string of horses. And for four polo players, it takes anywhere from six to eight horses per polo player to play a game of polo. So if you're taking 21 horses, they're probably 21 of your first-string horses ... and you've just lost every one of your best players.\n\n\n\n\"It's not like you could just go out and buy 21 new horses and start at that point.\"\n\n\n\nPolo ponies are thoroughbreds, many of them former racehorses retrained for the game, but they cover a wide range of ages, Wash said. When they get too old to play, they are retired to pasture or stud, he said.\n\n\n\n\"A polo horse is treated quite well,\" Wash said. \"In fact, when you're a polo horse, you might play three months here in Palm Beach, you might take three months off, you might play another three months, say, in Argentina or England, you take three months off. They're not pushed 12 months out of the year.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Kim Segal and John Couwels contributed to this report.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Kandi Burruss, the newest cast member of the reality show \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" was mourning the death Saturday of her fianc\u00e9, who died after a fistfight the night before.\n\n\n\nKandi Burruss, at right with co-star NeNe Leakes, appeared at the BET Awards in June.\n\n\n\nThe fianc\u00e9, 34-year-old Ashley \"A.J.\" Jewell, also appeared on the show.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Burruss said the actress was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\n\n\n\"She has no statement to make at this time and asks for privacy,\" Tresa Sanders said. She said the two planned to marry, even though the relationship had ups and downs.\n\n\n\nIn late August, Burruss told WVEE Radio in Atlanta, \"We're on hiatus,\" and she told Essence.com last month that the two were taking a break from each other.\n\n\n\nPolice said they contacted Burruss after Jewell's death.\n\n\n\nJewell and another man fought Friday night in the parking lot of the Atlanta strip club Body Tap, police spokesman Officer James Polite said.

  "context": "(AOL Autos) -- Protecting drivers and passengers from injury has been a high priority for car makers for the last 40 years or more.\n\n\n\nA truck driver tests an anti-collison system. The red light goes on if the car in front of him is too close.\n\n\n\nNot just because it's the right thing to do, but also because having a reputation for building safe vehicles helps automakers sell more cars.\n\n\n\nBut in recent years, high-tech advancements have come along at such a fast and furious rate that auto-safety systems have entered a whole new universe.\n\n\n\nFor most of the history of auto manufacturing, car makers' efforts in the area of safety have been devoted to developing \"passive\" safety features -- seat belts, air bags, building a stronger frame for the cabin, side-impact door beams, etc. All those things help you stay safe once you are involved in an accident.\n\n\n\nBut just as advanced technology has changed almost every other industry, so too has it changed the automotive industry, leading to the design of more \"active\" safety features. AOL Autos: Safest cars\n\n\n\nIt started with now-common features like anti-lock brakes (ABS) and electronic stability control systems (ESC). But in recent years, engineers have taken safety technology to a new level.\n\n\n\nAnd these days, they spend more time and money researching and developing \"crash avoidance\" features and technologies. These computerized systems, instead of protecting you if a crash occurs, help you avoid accidents in the first place.\n\n\n\nSome of these systems are already in vehicles on the road today, while others are coming down the pipeline in the next few years.\n\n\n\nMercedes uses radar, rear-view monitor\n\n\n\nGiven that it's a higher-priced luxury brand, it figures that Mercedes-Benz is one of the leaders when it comes to these kinds of high-tech crash-avoidance systems. Finely-tuned anti-lock brake and electronic-stability-control systems are standard equipment in all Mercedes cars. AOL Autos: Best and worst hybrids\n\n\n\n\"And presently, a number of our vehicles offer Distronic Plus, a crash-avoidance system that employs dual-band radar that measures the distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you,\" said Patrik Borenius, Mercedes' manager of advanced product planning.\n\n\n\n\"If that distance closes too rapidly, indicating that a crash might be imminent, it emits first an audible signal, then a visual warning, and the system can actually start to apply the brakes to a certain threshold.\n\n\n\n\"Or, if you start to apply the brakes yourself, but not quickly enough to help you avoid impact, our Brake Assist system applies even more braking power.\" AOL Autos: Most popular fuel-efficient cars\n\n\n\n\"We also have a Blind Spot Monitor that uses radar to examine the area just to the rear and to the left of your vehicle,\" added Bart Herring, product manager for Mercedes' S-Class and CL-Class. \"So when another vehicle, or any object, enters into that blind spot, a red indicator light in your side view mirror lights up. And if you start to change lanes while that other car is in your blind spot that also triggers an audio alert to warn you.\"\n\n\n\nPlus, Mercedes' Rear View Monitor \"views\" anything that is directly behind the vehicle as it is backing up, and then projects that image onto the navigation-system screen. This feature helps avoid accidents in situations where the vehicle is going in reverse and the driver's view of oncoming traffic is impaired -- like in parking structures, or when backing out of a driveway on a heavily-trafficked street. AOL Autos: Most popular crossover vehicles\n\n\n\nMercedes also offers a Night View system in the S-Class and CL-Class, which, at night, \"gives you a very sharp, daytime-quality picture of everything that is going on in front of you,\" Herring said. \"And it's projected onto a separate display screen that's in the middle of the instrument cluster, right in front of you.\"\n\n\n\nThe \"new frontier\" of safety technology\n\n\n\nFord Motor Company is another car maker where the engineers are excited about its tech-driven crash-avoidance systems -- some currently in use, some still in development. AOL Autos: Luxury cars with the best MPG\n\n\n\n\"Developing new active-safety systems really is the new frontier in safety technology in the auto industry,\" said Steve Kozak, Ford's global chief engineer for safety systems.\n\n\n\nFord has owned Volvo since 1999, so Ford is benefiting from many of Volvo's renowned safety features. \"Some of the more advanced features that were first offered in Volvo's vehicles are cascading down into the Ford product line, due to our engineers working together with theirs,\" Kozak said.\n\n\n\nOne Ford system in development addresses the fact that many accidents happen because drivers aren't paying attention. \"Studies have shown that in 50 percent of accidents, the drivers never even stepped on the brake,\" Kozak said. So, one technology that excites Kozak is the \"collision mitigation system\" that originated in the 2007 Volvo S80 and will be cascading into the Ford product line in the near future.\n\n\n\n\"It senses that that the car ahead of you is coming to a rapid stop, so if you're not paying attention, it essentially tells you to 'wake up and do something,' \" Kozak explained. \"With this system, there is a light mounted at the top of the instrument panel that reflects into the windshield, it's essentially a heads-up display, so in this kind of panic situation, that light will illuminate plus you get an audio alert telling you it's time to take action.\"\n\n\n\nFord is also presently developing a blind-spot alert system (for early '09 rollout) and a lane-departure warning system (similar to those offered in Mercedes vehicles) -- technologies that also originated in Volvo vehicles.\n\n\n\n\"One interesting aspect of the lane-departure system that we're working on is that it may involve 'tactile input' in addition to an audio warning,\" Kozak said. That is, when you're coming up too fast on the car ahead of you, \"you could get a vibrating sensation in the car seat or steering wheel.\"\n\n\n\nFrom roll mitigation to trailer stability -- and more\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Chrysler LLC is \"devoting plenty of resources and doing a lot of system-development work devoted to trying to mitigate a crash,\" said Chris Barman, Chrysler's director for active and passive safety systems.\n\n\n\nOne such crash-avoidance system currently employed in various Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep vehicles is an electronic Roll-Mitigation System. \"It senses when the vehicle is in danger or is moving sideways at a rapid pace, which could lead to a rollover,\" Barman explained. \"So it applies more brake pressure to the outside front wheel, which corrects the lateral motion and keeps the car moving forward.\"\n\n\n\nChrysler's own version of a computerized Brake-Assist system helps in another situation that is all too common, Barman said. \"Many times, in an emergency-braking situation, drivers will initially hit the brakes -- but then, unknowingly, let off the brake pedal, which means they lose a lot of stopping distance.\n\n\n\n\"So, if they don't hit the brakes with enough pressure, or don't brake fast enough, this system will detect that, and automatically applies the optimum amount of brake pressure in the shortest amount of time -- which could go a long way toward avoiding a crash and any resulting injury.\"\n\n\n\nAnother Chrysler feature Barman likes is the trailer-stability control system. \"Sometimes, if you've never towed a trailer before, or if maybe you have too much weight in the rear of the trailer, the trailer can start swaying back and forth,\" Barman explained. \"Well, this system uses sensors to determine yaw rate and lateral-movement rate, and then provides brake pressure that is counter to the sway of the trailer to get it to settle down.\"\n\n\n\nOther crash-avoiding features being introduced for the 2009 Chrysler Town & Country and the Dodge Caravan minivans are Chrysler's own version of the Blind Spot Monitoring system, plus the Rear Cross Path system, which uses an illuminated icon in the mirror and an audible chime to warn you of the presence of an oncoming vehicle when you're backing up -- like in the parking-structure scenario cited above.\n\n\n\n\"We're trying to take a 360-degree view all around the vehicle, in order to determine everything we can do to help a person avoid a crash,\" Barman said.",

The largest bonus paid was $6.4 million; seven other people also received more than $4 million each.\n\nAIG is under fire for awarding the bonuses while being kept afloat by more than $170 billion from the U.S. government's financial bailout.\n\nOn Tuesday, two key senators also announced a plan to impose a hefty tax on retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money or in which the United States has an equity interest.\n\nSens. Max Baucus, D-Montana, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, are the chairman and top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, respectively. They said companies would not be allowed to restructure the payments to those executives through deferred compensation to avoid the tax.\n\nGrassley and Baucus said all retention bonuses would be subject to a 35 percent excise tax for excessive compensation to be paid by the company and an additional 35 percent tax to be paid by the individual.\n\n\"Millions of Americans are losing their jobs -- millions. And to some degree, they're losing their jobs because of actions taken by some of these firms,\" Baucus said. \"At the same time, they're giving themselves bonuses. I mean, give me a break. What are these people thinking? That's part of the problem. They're not thinking.\"\n\nAll other nonretention bonuses of more than $50,000 would be subject to the same tax, the senators said.\n\n\"We're trying to address what I think taxpayers would say is salt in their wounds,\" Grassley said. \"The taxpayers are bearing a great deal to get this economy going, help get these corporations turned around, and I think taxpayers are willing to help.\n\n\"But when they see the lack of sensitivity on the part of corporate directors -- by giving these bonuses and doing other outrageous things -- there's just so much that the taxpayers of this country are going to stand for.\"\n\nThe provisions would apply to bonuses paid out after January 1, 2009, so it would affect the AIG bonuses in question.\n\n\"We should not be here. We should not be in this position,\" Baucus said. \"AIG should not have promised those payments to retain those employees, and the Treasury should have blocked the issuance of the checks. It did not. And employees themselves should not have cashed them in. We should not be here, but unfortunately we are.\"\n\nSenior Finance Committee aides said the senators had not yet worked out whether individuals would pay income tax on the bonuses as well as the proposed excise tax, or if a combination of the two would be used.  Watch why Americans are angry \u00bb\n\n\"You'll have to wait to see when we introduce the legislation,\" one of the aides said.\n\n\"If our bosses had made a decision, we'd tell you what it was,\" said another.  See a snapshot of facts, attitudes and analysis on the recession \u00bb\n\nOn Monday, President Obama said he planned to attempt to block bonuses to executives at ailing insurance giant AIG, payments he described as an \"outrage.\"\n\nObama said he asked Geithner to \"pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole.\" Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again.  Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses \u00bb\n\nThe president spared AIG CEO Edward Liddy from criticism, saying he got the job \"after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year.\"\n\nBut he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics. \"It's about our fundamental values,\" he said. iReport.com: Sound off on AIG\n\nUnder pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or \"retention payments\" -- by at least 30 percent. That has done little to temper outrage over the initial plan, however.  Who's insured by AIG? \u00bb\n\nLiddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets.\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.",

  "context": "OXFORD, England (CNN)  -- You might expect Oxford and Cambridge universities to ask prospective students to compare the works of Chaucer to Boccaccio or to explain the theory of relativity.\n\n\n\nCambridge students may have to field questions in the application process that would baffle some observers.\n\n\n\nInstead, Oxford wants to know: \"Would you rather be a novel or a poem?\"\n\n\n\nCambridge asks applicants: \"What would you do if you were a magpie?\"\n\n\n\nThe idea, say administrators at the two ultra-prestigious schools in England, is to see how well prospective students can think, not just how much they know.\n\n\n\n\"What we're trying to do is move students out of their comfort zone,\" said Mike Nicholson, Oxford University admissions director. \"Many students will have a body of knowledge, and they may be expected to be trusted on that in the interview. What we want to do is take them beyond that point and get them to start thinking for themselves.\"  See examples of the application questions \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 90 percent of students are educated at state schools. But 53 percent of Oxford University's students come from state schools. That seems to indicate that wealthier students who can afford private schools have an advantage.\n\n\n\nTutoring company Oxbridge Applications -- founded by Oxford graduates in 1999 -- says 68 percent of the 35,000 clients it has helped are state-funded students. It costs $300 for a day of mock interviews or $1,500 for a full weekend course. Oxbridge says 47 percent of its clients get into one of the elite colleges. The overall success rate for all applicants to the two schools -- commonly referred to as Oxbridge -- is 24 percent, the tutoring company says.\n\n\n\n\"At Oxbridge Applications, we have a network of 500 former tutors and former admissions tutors as well,\" said company founder James Uffindell. \"And we take the people that have been there and done it and help supply that information back to the people that want to go there.\"\n\n\n\nStill, some of the questions seem a bit odd to the casual observer.  Watch people on the street react to some brainteasers \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"It's totally out there really,\" said one passer-by interviewed on the street. \"Are they on drugs, these people in Cambridge?\"\n\n\n\nSome of the questions seem downright sinister: \"How would you poison someone without the police finding out?\" Cambridge asks.\n\n\n\nOthers are perhaps downright practical: \"Instead of politicians, why don't we let the managers of Ikea run the country?\"",

  "context": "QINGDAO, China (CNN) -- Another round of toasts and exclamations of \"hajiu\" sounded out around me. I took a sip and set down my small glass of Tsingtao beer as my new friends downed theirs and refilled. Our seafood dinner, perched on the single cluttered table of a tiny antique shop, was punctuated regularly by such moments.\n\n\n\nA worker operates the giant fermentation units at the Qingdao Brewery plant in Qingdao.\n\n\n\nI joined in happily, although somewhat bemused, at each increasingly beery celebration of our host, the worldly Captain Jau. My company, a gathering from four regions of China, was engaging me in Chinese drinking etiquette, in the city of Qingdao.\n\n\n\nA few drinks in the People's Republic of China led me to discover European delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city.\n\n\n\nYou'd be forgiven for not knowing where Qingdao (pronounced Chingdao) is. The Chinese city in Shandong province doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as Beijing, Shanghai, or even Xi'an.\n\n\n\nThe 2008 Olympics gave it a place on the map as China's sailing hub; no longer a secret that holiday-making officials could keep for themselves.\n\n\n\nBut my American spell-check doesn't recognize it (which says more about my spell-check), and you can still find pre-Cultural Revolution manhole covers. So what is it about this city that seduces the unassuming traveler?\n\n\n\nNestled on the coast of Shandong province, almost exactly halfway between its big sisters, Beijing and Shanghai, Qingdao features as a handy pit-stop on East coast itineraries. It boasts great infrastructure, a charming climate, alfresco eateries, good coffee, sandy beaches, German history, international hotels, a brand new airport and even a famous brewery.\n\n\n\nQingdao could pass itself off as a miniature Seattle if it weren't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five-star hotels speaks English, and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches, stoically named Number One to Number Six.\n\n\n\n\"In mainland China, Qingdao's history is uniquely international; in fact, more of the city's cultural identity is wrapped up in its German colonial past than even its prominent role in the emergence of Daoism\" said Eric Blocher, editor of the English-language magazine Red Star.\n\n\n\n\"The local culture bureau once joked to us that Qingdao is a 'cultural desert', because it doesn't have the dynastic lineage of Nanjing or Xi'an, or opera for that matter,\" Blocher said. \"But that's not what makes a city livable, or even fun -- if your office is in downtown, you're never more than five minutes from a protected beach; there's always excellent seafood close at hand; you can buy China's best beer fresh, for 10 cents a pound, and walk around drinking it out of a plastic bag.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing this key advice, I visited Qingdao during the International Beer Festival in late August, an event aimed largely at a domestic Chinese market. The West knows beer. China does not. The annual Beer Festival aims to change this. While the bright lights and myriad beers flowed, one thing was obvious: this was for the tourists.\n\n\n\nTrue Qingdaonese people are fiercely proud of Tsingtao beer, produced just down the road on Beer Street, and little else is drunk here in homes or bars. Pijiu, beer in Mandarin, is hajiu in Qingdaonese, the regional dialect. When in doubt, this does as well for a toast as anything else. Indeed, there is no better way of celebrating an occasion than by toasting the guest of honor with a bag of fresh beer.\n\n\n\nIf I was the guest of honor at Captain Jau's table, I certainly wasn't living up to expectations. Particularly not for my self-appointed etiquette guardian and \"pure Qingdao boy,\" Loukas. As I raised my glass for a sip and Loukas jumped to toast the good weather for the nth time, it all became clear. In Qingdao, a beer glass is never raised without a toast.\n\n\n\nThis serves three (frankly ingenious) purposes; beer is drunk in unison; beer isn't consumed too rapidly, since constant toasting would ruin conversation; and everyone finds ways to honor each other for the purposes of toasting. Captain Jau was particularly in favor of the latter as our eccentric host was made subject of most cheers, likewise teaching us the salutations he had learned from the many foreign guests he had cooked for. From the French \"salut!\" to the German \"prost!\" to the Turkish \"serefe!\" Most popular of all was homegrown \"hajiu!\"\n\n\n\nAlcohol is enjoyed throughout China. Microbreweries are yet to catch on here like they have in Japan and Singapore. For now Tsingtao holds the monopoly, and Qingdao's people aren't complaining.\n\n\n\nThe Tsingtao Brewery, founded in 1903 by German settlers, confiscated by the Japanese in 1915, turned over to state ownership in 1949 and finally privatized in the early 1990s, has witnessed a colorful history. The largest stakeholder, Anheuser-Busch, recently sold majority ownership to Japanese Asahi Breweries.\n\n\n\nResidents are the first to introduce you to their biggest export. Outside every shop is a barrel or two of Tsingtao, with a ream of clean plastic bags ready to be filled with cheap 3.5 percent beer. Tsingtao beer tastes crisp and sweet (most likely from rice mixed in to cut down on the cost of barley. It is bought by the pound and weighed to prevent gaseous volume manipulation. A pint, when sold in this method, costs around 1.5 renminbi, or 22 U.S. cents.\n\n\n\nBeer is a way of life here and has been ever since the Germans arrived and erected tree-lined avenues, red-roofed houses and a brewery. The Germans are gone but the beer stayed. And with it, three hajiu-loving generations tell you about their happy memories.\n\n\n\n\"When I was little, buying beer was one special job I did for my dad every summer day,\" explained Irene Cheung over a fresh bag of beer. \"I was the little girl proudly and carefully carrying the plastic bag home.\"\n\n\n\nIt is easier to identify Qingdao by what it is not -- smoggy, crowded Beijing, or nightlife hub Shanghai -- than what it is or hopes to be. This may be the very reason why Qingdao remains largely unvisited by the West. And while there may not be much more than good weather, food and beer to keep you content, that may just be enough to hop on the three-hour flight from Hong Kong, or the one hour 20 minute-journey from Beijing or Shanghai.\n\n\n\nFollowing Olympic-based investment, more than 3,000 factories have sprung up in the airport suburbs. You can source anything from shoes to jewels to Durex condoms among the largely Korean-owned industries. If these things aren't up your street, head elsewhere; like functionally named Beer Street, Bar Street, or my personal favorite, Coffee and Tea Craft Street.\n\n\n\n\"We used to have to put on parties so that there would be material to justify an English-oriented lifestyle magazine,\" editor Blocher said. \"Now we have trouble keeping track!\"\n\n\n\nCheck out English-language newspaper Red Star, for informative listings and an insight into the growing English-speaking population that has stumbled upon and stayed in Qingdao.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Hall of Fame football linebacker Lawrence Taylor was charged Thursday with rape and patronizing a prostitute in a case involving a 16-year-old girl, police in Ramapo, New York, said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor's attorney said the former New York Giants star denied the charges and will fight them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My client did not have sex with anybody. Period,\" Arthur Aidala said, adding: \"Lawrence Taylor did not rape anybody.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor appeared at an afternoon court hearing where a judge set bail at $75,000. Taylor was not asked to enter a plea and left the courthouse after posting bail.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing television cameras outside the courthouse, Taylor said, \"I'm not that important\" as he walked away.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor, 51, was arrested in a Holiday Inn room a few hours after the alleged rape took place, according to Christopher St. Lawrence, the town supervisor and police commissioner in Ramapo, about 30 miles northwest of New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice Chief Peter Brower said Taylor was charged with third-degree rape, a felony, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17. Taylor also was charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage victim $300 to have sex, Brower said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Brower, the rape charge carries a possible four-year prison term, and the patronization charge, a misdemeanor, could bring up to a year in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked whether Taylor knew that the victim was underage, Brower said \"ignorance is not an excuse\" for having sex with a minor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAidala said after the bail hearing that Taylor \"is denying and preparing to fight each and every one of those charges.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAidala said that \"no violence, no force, no threat, no weapons\" was involved in the case. He noted that the rape charge against Taylor was for consensual sex with a minor and said Taylor denied it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Lawrence and Brower said the alleged victim, since March a runaway from New York's Bronx borough, was allegedly brought to Ramapo by a pimp on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the pimp and the girl returned to New York early Thursday, she texted an uncle who notified the New York police, St. Lawrence said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York police arrested the pimp and called Ramapo police, and Taylor was arrested in his hotel room at around 4 a.m., according to St. Lawrence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alleged victim had facial injuries that police determined occurred before she entered the Holiday Inn room, St. Lawrence said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective Lt. Brad Weidel said police knocked twice on Taylor's hotel door and identified themselves before entering the room. Weidel and St. Lawrence said Taylor was cooperative with authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor was a 10-time All-Pro linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993 after earning All American honors at the University of North Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nA punishing tackler and pass rusher known by his initials \"L.T.,\" he was on two Super Bowl champion teams and was inducted into the National Football League's Hall of Fame, which noted that he \"redefined the way the outside linebacker position was played.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Taylor was twice suspended by the NFL for substance abuse and battled a cocaine addiction long after retirement, resulting in several arrests and a downward spiral that he chronicled in a 2003 autobiography.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter kicking drugs, he worked as a sports commentator and appeared as a contestant on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars\" in 2009. Taylor and his dance partner on the program, Edyta Sliwinska, were eliminated in the seventh week of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrower said that police found a bottle of alcohol in Taylor's hotel room but that Taylor showed no sign of inebriation. Brower said that no drugs were found in the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Lepselter, Taylor's agent, said Taylor was very upset about the charges against him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's worked very hard over the last 12 years to change perceptions about him,\" Lepselter said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ross Levitt and Alan Chernoff contributed to this story.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Let's face it, if you're on holiday in Miami you'll want to be based near the beach, which, fortunately, is where the city's most glamorous hotels are located.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Beach is known for its Art Deco hotels, like The Delano, left.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Beach is known for its distinctive Art Deco hotels, mostly built in the 1920s and 30s and often painted in bright pastel colors. South Beach's Art Deco originals have been protected since the 1970s, and many have since been renovated to the highest specifications.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollins Avenue is home to more than its fair share of boutique hotels. The Delano (1685 Collins Avenue, doubles from $400) dates back to the 1940s and is crowned with streamlined fins that are pure Deco.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been re-imagined by Ian Schrager, with a white, minimal Philippe Starck-designed interior that is sophisticated and hip. The Delano's Rose Bar is one of the best places in town for a poolside cocktail.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shore Club (1901 Collins Avenue, doubles from $300) is another Schrager revival of a Deco hotel and, if anything, it's even cooler than The Delano. Rooms are high-tech, welcoming and often occupied by visiting celebrities. The attached sushi restaurant Nobu is top notch and the stylish Skybar, with its four bars and tropical gardens, is one of the city's hottest nightspots.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a favorite hotel or place to stay in Miami?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've just won the lottery, you'll want to stay at the Setai (2001 Collins Avenue, doubles from $785). Another conversion of an Art Deco hotel, albeit augmented by a 40-storey tower, the Setai adds tasteful Asian influences. Its cool, dark interior is a refreshingly tasteful oasis among the South Beach excess, and is both unashamedly luxurious and frighteningly expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in the real world, The Standard (40 Island Avenue, Miami Beach, doubles from $250) is a little stranded in its Biscayne Bay locale, but is great value. The real draw is the superb spa, with its infinity pool and open-air mud lounge. But this is no austere health retreat; it's relaxing and fun, and all the better for it. This is Miami after all...\n\n\n\n\n\nA cheaper, quirkier option is Pelican (826 Ocean Drive, doubles from $200). Owned by Italian fashion label Diesel, this is a colorful, kitschy place, with individually themed rooms, such as the ornate and floral 'Power Flower' room. The hotel's Pelican Caf\u00e9 has an outstanding wine list and is surprisingly good value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAway from the beach altogether, the Biltmore (1200 Anastasia Avenue, doubles from $310), over in Coral Gables, is an absolute gem. The rooms aren't exceptional but the building is a beauty, modeled on the Giralda bell tower in Seville, with ornate Moorish-inspired touches. Al Capone was a big fan back in the 1920s and these days there's a massive pool, an 18-hole golf course and rumors of resident ghosts...\n\n\n\n\n\n......................\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami City Guide:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to stay | What to see | Where to be seen | Where to eat | Where to shop\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you agree with our Miami picks?

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama says the commissions are OK, \"provided that they are properly structured and administered.\"\n\n\n\nOn the heels of Obama's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes.\n\n\n\nObama said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years: the Military Commissions Act put in place under the Bush administration in 2006, but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe president said military commissions \"are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war, provided that they are properly structured and administered.\" But, he said, the 2006 act \"failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor.\n\n\n\nStatements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment, such as waterboarding, will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions, Obama said, and hearsay evidence will be limited.\n\n\n\nThe revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify. Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts.\n\n\n\n\"These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, applauded his former opponent.\n\n\n\n\"Today's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security,\" McCain said in a written statement.\n\n\n\nBut Obama's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU chided the military commission decision as \"a striking blow to due process and the rule of law.\"\n\n\n\n\"These military commissions are inherently illegitimate, unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust,\" said Anthony D. Romero, the group's executive director.\n\n\n\n\"Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide 'more due process' is absurd; there is no such thing as 'due process light.' \" he said. \"If the administration's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements, there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system. If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,\" Gibbs told reporters.\n\n\n\nObama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week.\n\n\n\nGibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil. Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions. Three Guantanamo detainees' cases have gone through the commission so far.\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration established the military trial system after the U.S. military began capturing detainees in Afghanistan in late 2001. The next year, it opened the Guantanamo facility, saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system.\n\n\n\nBut legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated.\n\n\n\nOne lawyer representing a client at Guantanamo said closing the detention facility, which Obama is advocating, is a \"meaningless gesture\" if the military commissions continue.\n\n\n\n\"The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed,\" said Army Maj. Jon S. Jackson, a lawyer for Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process.\n\n\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, is the most high-profile of those defendants.",

The search for more debris continues.\n\n\n\nThe two flight members are among the victims that have been identified, Air France said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\n\nAbout a dozen victims have been identified among roughly 50 bodies recovered from the crash of Flight 447, which killed 228 people on June 1, authorities in Brazil said this week.\n\n\n\nCrews continue to search for bodies, wreckage and flight-data recorders that apparently rest deep on the ocean floor. Data from the recorders may be crucial in helping investigators determine what caused the plane to crash.  Watch more wreckage recovered from crash \u00bb\n\n\n\nAutopsies conducted on some of the 50 bodies found so far show they suffered broken bones, including arms, legs and hips, Brazilian authorities have told French investigators, according to Paul-Louis Arslanian, head of the French accident investigation board.\n\n\n\nSuch injuries suggest that the plane broke apart in midair, experts have said.\n\n\n\nAsked about that theory, Air France Chief Executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon told France's RTL radio this week that he would not go that far.\n\n\n\n\"What I know is that the investigators would like to know the causes of death,\" Gourgeon said. \"That knowledge of causes of death will better clarify what exactly happened. Were the victims killed before the impact, or during impact?\"\n\n\n\nSearchers have found dozens of pieces of debris in the water and think they know the general location of the wreck, but Arslanian said this week that there is a chance the entire aircraft may never be found.\n\n\n\nAir France plans to pay relatives of the victims an initial compensation equivalent to about $24,500, or 17,500 euros, for each victim, Gourgeon has said.\n\n\n\nThe airliner said this week that it has been in touch with about 1,800 relatives of the people who died when the Airbus A330 crashed, but that it has been difficult tracing the relatives of all 228 victims.\n\n\n\n\"The modern world is different and we often have only a cell phone, and as you can imagine, this cell phone is unfortunately in the aircraft,\" Gourgeon said. \"So we probably (will put in) more hours to access all the relatives.\"\n\n\n\nThe company is also providing families with counseling, he said.\n\n\n\nThe were 32 different nationalities present on Flight 447.",

  "context": "New York (CNN) -- As snow fell across New York harbor, Isabel Belarsky said she clutched her mother, Clara, aboard a passenger ship that puttered toward Ellis Island, and wondered what their new lives would bring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year was 1930. About a week earlier, the 10 year-old girl from what is now called Saint Petersburg, Russia, had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her Ukrainian parents from the French port city of Cherbourg, escaping what she described as Jewish persecution at the start of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an island near Manhattan stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a wonderful sight,\" she said of the Statue of Liberty, which marks its 125th anniversary Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea for the monument is thought to have been first conceived at a 19th century dinner party among French aristocrats, historians say, who sought to pay tribute to American liberty.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while the French gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics, for many it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in America's post- Civil War period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The arrival on Ellis Island is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you,\" said Belarksy, now a 91-year-old widow living in a Russian enclave of Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, according to the U.S. National Park Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjacent to Ellis towers Lady Liberty, measuring more than 305 feet from base to torch.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally, the statue was supposed to be an Egyptian peasant girl that would have stood at the entrance of Egypt's then-new Suez Canal, historians say, but plans would later evolve into the Roman goddess that would instead adorn New York harbor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sculptor, (Frederic) Bartholdi, was very clever,\" said Edward Berenson, professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He put (the statue) where he did because its right at the narrows of New York harbor, so he knew that every boat that came into New York would have to come really close to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople felt like they could reach out and touch it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired perhaps by Egypt's colossal statues during his own travels to Cairo, Berenson added, Bartholdi sought to build a monument of his own in a tribute to American liberty and its new found emancipation of slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statue rests atop a sculpted wrangling of broken chains on New York's Liberty Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly years later, Berenson argues, did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public, despite the structure's engraved plaque bearing the now famous poem by Emma Lazarus, who asks for the \"huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many who made the perilous journey, Belarsky said she had often wondered what kind of life was waiting for her on the shores behind the copper monument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was quite frightening,\" she recalled. \"The three of us, my father, my mother and I, wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us whats next.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd though a U.S. law passed six years earlier had largely restricted immigration, her father, Sidor, had managed to secure three tickets to America by way of a talent scout who visited the Leningrad conservatory where he had performed as an opera singer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He had such a beautiful voice,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir travel permit, however, was only temporary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSidor had acquired a six-month visa to teach at Brigham Young University, said Belarsky.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the young family would nonetheless settle more permanently in a west Manhattan apartment. And unlike many who eventually returned to their homelands in Europe, the Belarskys decided to leave Saint Petersburg -- then known as Leningrad -- behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Authorities were starting to clamp down and consolidate the social state and Soviet power around Stalin,\" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \"As an opera singer, you might not have wanted to start singing Soviet anthems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the young family left Russia without plans to return, Belarsky added.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd though many immigrants entered the United States through Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami; historians say steamship companies most often cruised into New York harbor, commonly making the Statue of Liberty the first land sighting for new arrivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody spoke of the golden land,\" said Belarksy. \"Come to America where there's gold on the streets, until they came here and they had to live in walk-up tenement houses,\" she said, referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as America's need for industrial labor grew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you think immigration is unpopular now,\" said Berenson. \"If anything it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessive immigrant waves, however, still rushed to America's shores through Ellis Island and past the Statue of Liberty, often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it took a while for people to think of themselves as Americans,\" said Berenson. \"For an awful lot of people, what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally, and as Americans too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnniversary celebrations of the Statue of Liberty will be marked Friday by a series of official speeches and web cams, provided by Earthcam, that are expected stream video footage from the torch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following day the statue will close for renovations, though Liberty Island will remain open, according to the National Park Service.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British airlines have put into effect measures to stop people with swine flu boarding flights in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading further.\n\n\n\nMedical screening for the swine flu virus has been introduced at many airports.\n\n\n\nBritish Airways said there had been a \"very small number of cases\" where people who had checked in with symptoms of H1N1 had been advised not to travel after having medical checks.\n\n\n\nVirgin Atlantic also said victims would not be allowed to board one of its planes without a fit-to-fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital, though there had been no cases yet.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the virus a global pandemic June 11. More than 120 countries have reported cases of human infection. About 98,000 cases have been documented worldwide, with 440 deaths, according to the WHO.  Watch as airlines ban sufferers \u00bb\n\n\n\nWith 29 deaths and a huge rise in the number of cases, Britain has the worst swine flu figures in Europe.\n\n\n\nEight British schoolchildren remained in hospital in China on Monday after contracting swine flu on a trip to the country, the Foreign Office said. The teenagers were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus in Beijing. More than 50 of their classmates and teachers are also quarantined in a hotel.  Watch as students are quarantined \u00bb\n\n\n\nMedical screening for the swine flu virus has been introduced at many airports around the world for passengers arriving on international flights but there are concerns that many people may not be aware they are infected.\n\n\n\nThose who do have symptoms have been advised by Britain's health authorities to delay their journeys until the signs have cleared up.\n\n\n\n\"We have a medical team within the airline as well as a contingency planning group which has met for the past few years to look at the issue of a flu pandemic,\" A British Airways spokeswoman said.\n\n\n\n\"We have a wide range of contingency plans in place which we can use depending on how the situation may evolve.\n\n\n\n\"If we have concerns about a customer or the customer is concerned, then we have a 24-hour medical service we can call to give advice to staff.\n\n\n\n\"They will speak to the customer and an assessment will be made about their fitness to fly.\n\n\n\n\"There have been a number of cases where we have advised customers not to fly on the basis of their diagnosis or symptoms of H1N1.\"  Watch as a CNN reporter is quarantined \u00bb\n\n\n\nBA told CNN Monday though that it was \"business as usual\" and all flights were operating normally.\n\n\n\nVirgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles said: \"If there are signs of something being wrong, be it excessive sneezing or coughing, not looking well, high temperature, then the airport staff can call in a medical team for extra advice.\n\n\n\n\"If the medical team believe there are reasons not to fly, the passenger will be asked to produce a fit to fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital, and they will be put at our cost on to the next available flight.\"\n\n\n\nSwine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the World Health Organization is changing tactics against the H1N1 virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns.\n\n\n\n\"At this point, further spread of the pandemic, within affected countries and to new countries, is considered inevitable,\" the WHO said.\n\n\n\nThe counting of all cases is no longer essential because it is exhausting countries' resources, the organization said.\n\n\n\n\"In some countries, this strategy is absorbing most national laboratory and response capacity, leaving little capacity for the monitoring and investigation of severe cases, and other exceptional events.\"\n\n\n\nMonitoring is still required, the organization urged, but should focus on exceptional patterns.\n\n\n\n\"Because the numbers of cases have increased in so many countries, it is very hard to keep up,\" Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director-general, said earlier this month.\n\n\n\nLaboratories have been inundated with testing requests and the virus is showing up in most lab tests in countries with major outbreaks, he said.\n\n\n\nThe organization said it will not issue global tables showing confirmed cases for countries that have reported cases, according to the release.\n\n\n\nHowever, it will still report on nations that have not had cases so that its presence can be confirmed. \"WHO will continue to request that these countries report the first confirmed cases and, as far as feasible, provide weekly aggregated case numbers and descriptive epidemiology of the early cases.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, governments should should be on the lookout for unusual patterns, the organization said.\n\n\n\nWhile most patients have reported mild symptoms, a rise in severe symptoms or respiratory ailments that require hospitalization should be cause for concern, it said. Governments should also pay attention to unusual patterns linked to fatal cases, the WHO said.\n\n\n\nAny changes in prevailing patterns should be flagged, including a rise in school and job absenteeism, and an increase in visits to the emergency room.\n\n\n\nAn overwhelmed health system may mean there is a rise in severe cases, the organization said.",

  "context": "(Mental Floss) -- Owning a professional sports franchise is my dream job. (I'm willing to relocate.) Of course, I could never afford my own team. There's a better chance I'll miraculously develop an unhittable slider, or learn to punt.\n\nNFL team owner Robert Kraft got his start in the paper business.\n\nYou obviously must be exceedingly wealthy to become an owner.\n\nDid you ever wonder how all these people made all that money?\n\nI sure hope you did, because we went and did all this research.\n\nHere's a list of nine billionaire owners and how they built their fortunes.\n\n1. Rich DeVos, Orlando Magic (NBA)\n\nIn 1959, DeVos and high school friend Jay Van Andel started selling all-purpose cleaner.\n\nTheir business grew to become Amway, which now brings in $6 billion each year under the ominous-sounding Alticor name.\n\nWhether you see Amway as an empowering direct sales company or a something resembling a cult, it sure was good to DeVos.\n\nForbes estimates his wealth at $3.5 billion, making the paltry $85 million he spent on the Magic in 1991 a minor investment.\n\n2. Robert L. Johnson, Charlotte Bobcats (NBA)\n\nLower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth.\n\nSo I'm all kinds of envious of Robert L., who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001.\n\nHis fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce, but Johnson's estimated net worth is still $1.1 billion.\n\nHis resume is full of firsts  BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE.\n\nHe was the first African-American billionaire in the U.S. And, in 2002, he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise.\n\n3. Robert Kraft, New England Patriots (NFL)\n\nI'd never given it much thought, but I'd always assumed Kraft bought the Patriots with big cheese money he'd inherited.\n\nBut Kraft got his start in the paper business. His wife, Myra, is the daughter of Massachusetts philanthropist Jacob Hiatt.\n\nAfter Kraft finished Harvard Business School, he went to work with his father-in-law's packaging company.\n\nIn 1972, Kraft founded International Forest Products, which is now part of the Kraft Group -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from Gillette Stadium to the New England Revolution (Major League Soccer) to Carmel Container Systems (Israel's largest packaging plant).\n\nKraft is seen as a savior in New England -- before he bought the team in 1994, the Pats seemed destined for relocation to St. Louis. Plus he's made them really, really good, winning three Super Bowls this decade.\n\nAnother reason I'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state.\n\nIn 2005, Kraft met Vladimir Putin, who walked off with one of Kraft's Super Bowl rings.\n\nKraft now claims it was a gift, but that might just be what you say when a Russian leader steals your jewelry. Mental Floss: How ex-presidents and prime ministers make ends meet\n\n4. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Seattle Mariners (MLB)\n\nDespite America's strong resistance to Japanese ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- Hiroshi Yamauchi became majority owner of the Seattle Mariners in 1992.\n\nYamauchi is the man credited with transforming Nintendo from playing-card company to video game giant.\n\nHis 55-year tenure saw incredible growth. But that doesn't mean there weren't a few bumps along the way. Forays into instant rice, taxi service and short-stay hotels (also known as \"love hotels\") did not pan out.\n\n5. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys (NFL)\n\nJerry Jones built an oil empire in the early 1970s, striking gas in the first thirteen wells he drilled. His father had given him a head start; Pat Jones sold the Modern Security Life Insurance Company for millions.\n\nAn undersized guard, Jones was captain of the 1965 Cotton Bowl-winning Arkansas Razorbacks.\n\nFuture Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson was a teammate, and Johnson's successor, Barry Switzer, was a Razorbacks assistant.\n\nJones bought the Cowboys for an estimated $140 million in 1989.\n\nHe immediately made waves by firing Tom Landry -- the only coach in Cowboys history -- and replacing him with his college buddy (the aforementioned Jimmy Johnson, who was coaching the University of Miami).\n\nAfter a rocky 1-15 start in 1989, the Cowboys went on to win three Super Bowls in the 1990s.   Mental Floss: A brief history of stadium naming rights\n\n6. Malcolm Glazer, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL), Manchester United (English Premier League)\n\nMalcolm Glazer inherited a small jewelry repair business from his father.\n\nBut it was Malcolm's investments in Florida trailer parks that started his financial ascent.\n\nHe went on to become president and CEO of First Allied Corporation, which now owns 6,700,000 square feet of retail space. He was also chairman of Gilbert/Robinson, Inc., which managed over 100 restaurants, including Houlihan's and Darryl's.\n\nToday, the Glazer family oversees strip malls and nursing homes throughout the land.\n\nGlazer also has a large stake in Zapata, an oil company founded by George H.W. Bush.\n\nGlazer made five previous attempts to join the elite ranks of NFL ownership, including a failed 1993 bid to bring an expansion team to Baltimore.\n\nThe New York Times said Glazer had \"a reputation as a franchise window shopper, one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale.\"\n\nBut in 1995, he outbid George Steinbrenner for the downtrodden Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nUnder his leadership, the franchise was righted, earning a Super Bowl title in 2003.\n\nGlazer also bought Manchester United, and fans weren't exactly pleased.\n\n7. Stanley Kroenke, Denver Nuggets (NBA), Colorado Avalanche (NHL), St. Louis Rams (NFL -- partial owner)\n\nKroenke is a self-made man who also married mega-rich.\n\nHe earned his estimated $2.1 billion fortune in real estate, developing shopping centers across the country.\n\nThen he went ahead and married a Walton -- Ann Walton. Sam's niece. She's worth another $3+ billion.\n\nA sports junkie, Kroenke also owns Major League Soccer franchise Colorado Rapids and a share in Premier League's Arsenal F.C.\n\n8. Daniel Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers (NBA)\n\nWith $5,000 he'd earned delivering pizzas -- and after a stint as a TV reporter -- the future Cavs owner started a small mortgage company called Rock Financial in 1985.\n\nIn 1999, the company was bought by Intuit for $532 million.\n\nThree years later, Gilbert bought it back for $64 mil, renaming the company Quicken Loans.\n\nHe purchased the Cavaliers for $375 mil in 2005.\n\nHe also owns Fathead, which makes wall decals and tiresome ads.\n\nOn the side, Gilbert is working to beat Michigan's steroid-free bench-pressing record.\n\n9. Stephen Bisciotti, Baltimore Ravens (NFL)\n\nAt 48, Stephen Bisciotti is one of the NFL's youngest owners.\n\nHe made his money in staffing -- specifically, finding talented engineers for the aerospace industry.\n\nWith Jim Davis, Bisciotti founded Aerotek in 1983 (he was 23).\n\nTheir staffing company, now known as the Allegis Group, had revenues of $4.4 billion in 2005.\n\nBisciotti bought 49 percent of the Ravens in 2000, and purchased the rest from Art Modell in 2004.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather will cement his position as the most bankable boxer in the world in Saturday night's non-title welterweight fight against fellow American Shane Mosley in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 33-year-old, whose nicknames include \"Money,\" has already generated $292 million in revenue in six pay-per-view fights for broadcaster HBO, from 5.5 million buys.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is expected to take home $58.5 million for himself if the battle with veteran Mosley achieves two million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMayweather is already fourth on the broadcaster's all-time list behind Oscar De La Hoya ($610.6 million on 12.6 million buys from 18 events), Mike Tyson ($545 million on 12.4 million buys, 12 bouts) and Evander Holyfield ($543 million on 12.6 million buys, 14 fights).\n\n\n\n\n\nDe La Hoya and Tyson have both retired, while the 47-year-old Holyfield last month kept alive his unlikely dream of winning the world heavyweight title for a record fifth time by claiming the little-regarded WBF crown in front of just 3,000 people in Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\nMayweather's 2007 victory over De La Hoya earned a record $120 million for a single pay-per-view event from 2.15 million buys, and HBO told CNN that his fight with the 38-year-old Mosley is set to qualify as a true \"megafight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In boxing, megafights are those that reach one million buys,\" HBO Pay-Per-View senior vice-president Mark Taffet said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By every indicator -- ticket sales, closed circuit television sales, views of video on the Internet, and the number of viewers of HBO's 24/7 series -- Mayweather-Mosley is on track to becoming a true PPV megafight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, Internet, Facebook, MySpace, iTunes, Youtube, HBO, or at retail stores across the country, fans everywhere are surrounded by this great event. The Mayweather-Mosley buzz is everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMayweather is undefeated in 40 fights, and has won six world titles at five different weights.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he has lost his No. 1 ranking as the highly-regarded Ring Magazine's world's top pound-for-pound boxer to rival Manny Pacquiao. The two were due to clash earlier this year but the Filipino pulled out due to Mayweather's demands for Olympic-style blood-testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Floyd Mayweather is a bonafide PPV superstar,\" Taffet said. \"He is one of most prolific performers in PPV history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it takes two to make a true megafight and, like Floyd Mayweather, Shane Mosley is a future Hall-of-Famer and one of the most recognizable boxing stars of this era. Shane is a critical ingredient in the megafight status of Mayweather-Mosley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While Shane and Floyd definitely have very passionate fan bases in their hometowns [Lynwood, California and Grand Rapids, Michigan respectively], both Mayweather and Mosley are national figures with broad and diverse fan bases throughout the entire U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As the 'Who R U Picking?' polls indicate, fans everywhere are talking about this matchup and it is virtually a 50-50 split as to who the fans think will win.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many pundits expect Mayweather and Pacquiao to agree to fight by the end of this year, the American has taunted the Filipino by saying he is not enough of a box office draw.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacquiao's fights with De La Hoya and Juan Marquez brought in significantly fewer buys than Mayweather's clashes with the duo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He needs to learn how to do numbers like I'm doing,\" Mayweather, who shunned the chance of winning the WBA belt against Mosley as he did not want to pay the sanctioning fees, told Boxingscene.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He needs to step his game up. I'm not worried about this [Mosley fight]. I know I'm going to do crazy numbers. I should walk away with about $40 million. With or without Pacquiao I'm going to be able to go out and make $20 million or $30 million a night.\"",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Andrew on Wednesday defended comments he made suggesting the United States might have been better off had its leaders learned from the British experience with colonialism before invading Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince Andrew says he has accepted that his comments could be interpreted as controversial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact is that we have learned, sometimes at our expense, in the years when we were a colonial power,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So there may or may not have been things and ideas that were of valid use to what was going on at that particular time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 47-year-old prince, in Atlanta on a 10-day U.S. tour to promote British business, said the two countries are closely allied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been allies, for goodness' sake, for how long?\" he said.  Watch him discuss his new role \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are now working very much more closely together than we have over the centuries, apart from when we were very, very close during the second World War.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Duke of York cited U.S.-British anti-terrorism efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as an area where the two countries are working together to promote stability and change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York Times last week quoted the prince as saying there are \"occasions when people in the U.K. would wish that those in responsible positions in the U.S. might listen and learn from our experiences.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added, \"If you are looking at colonialism, if you are looking at operations on an international scale, if you are looking at understanding each other's culture, understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign -- we have been through them all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problems faced by U.S. war planners in Iraq have bred \"healthy skepticism\" toward what comes out of Washington, he told the newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his CNN interview Wednesday, Andrew said he did not consider those comments controversial when he made them, but has since accepted how they could be interpreted that way.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the Falklands War veteran who served 22 years in the Royal Navy added, \"You have to take the bashes with the good bits, and I've got a thick skin.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked whether he believes the situation in Iraq is improving, Andrew said he could not answer what he described as \"almost a university Ph.D. question.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I can possibly predict those sorts of ways that governments work to each other,\" he said. \"I'm only a small cog in a very, very large machine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of his visit is to promote business investment in Britain, he said. Of the approximately 1,000 investment projects that were begun last year in Britain, more than half came from the United States, resulting in the addition of more than 32,000 jobs, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now I realize that what keeps us all going is international commerce, it's global trade,\" he said. \"In some cases, politics keeps a lot of people thinking, but what actually makes the world go round is the commerce that goes on.\" E-mail to a friend",

While Metellus and others are glued to TVs, she said, \"We're not learning a thing. It's just making me sick with worry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you looking for loved ones in Haiti?\n\n\n\n\n\nHaiti is the most impoverished nation in the Western Hemisphere. Plagued with \"political violence for most of its history,\" according to the CIA World Factbook, the Caribbean island nation has suffered from colonialism, coups and corruption since becoming the first black republic in 1804.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you there? Submit an iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half of the country lives in \"abject poverty.\" The nation imports more than four times the goods it exports and about two-thirds of the labor force lacks formal jobs, the CIA reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You worry about everything at this point,\" said Metellus. She said the Haitian community in South Florida numbers from 250,000 to 500,000 people. \"The basic infrastructure we're accustomed to here is nonexistent. To assess the damage is going to be a momentous undertaking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete coverage of the earthquake\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease is rampant, and it's still common for children to die from drinking and washing in fecal contaminated water. UNICEF estimates that 70 percent of Haitians do not have access to \"safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNyvrose Fleurent of Brooklyn, New York, works for the community outreach group Haitian American United Progress and said most Haitian immigrants in the United States have family still on the island. They often financially support family members who aren't able to leave, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said this while watching the news. Earlier in the morning she had hugged her brother good-bye before he flew to Port-au-Prince airport in Haiti. She had no idea the city would be hit by an earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\nFleurent, 38, remains hopeful her family will be unharmed. Her brother and cousins reside in Cap-Ha\u00eftien, in the north, on the opposite side of the country from Port-au-Prince, the city closest to the earthquake's epicenter.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven so, she worried about the impact Tuesday's 7.0 quake will have on her struggling home country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The people who live there can barely make it,\" Fleurent said. \"They can't even eat and get money for their basic needs, so this is going to be a big blow for them. I don't know where Haiti is going to be in the future. It's already so bad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State Department Operations Center has set up the following number for Americans seeking information about family members in Haiti: 1-888-407-4747\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's John Blake contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- I'm not an auto mechanic, I'm an Army wife, a mother and -- when time permits -- a journalist. So when my car needs work, I take it to someone with oil on his hands and years of experience looking under hoods. The same is true for plumbing problems, legal issues and medical care.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't assume that I know better than the experts. When necessary, I get a second opinion but, ultimately, I always yield to the advice of those who know more than me.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, I am thrilled that President Obama has decided to listen to his experts -- the military commanders and strategists -- and is committing more troops to Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as an Army wife at Fort Bragg whose husband has already done three tours of duty in Afghanistan, I can't help but close my eyes, grit my teeth and brace myself for the hard days ahead. As happy as I am that the president has finally made a move after months of deliberating, I know that this announcement is likely bad news for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployments are awful -- just awful. There is no bright side and no silver lining. For most of us in the military community the luster of sacrificing for our country wore off a deployment or two ago and we are now coasting on the fumes of commitment and shared sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of us who are married to the military aren't even sure why we are willing to endure yet another deployment. We just are.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur spouses see the fight firsthand and are reminded daily of why this battle must be won. They get pep talks at work and enjoy the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers. We at home just hear the gripes of war-weary Americans and see the news reports of waning support.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't experience the victories, we only see our children developing emotional problems, our marriages falling apart, our careers sidelined, our dependence on antidepressants climbing, even our houses crumbling from years of neglected repairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why a troop surge in Afghanistan brings mixed feelings. More troops there means more casualties -- a word I don't take lightly. Casualties are people, people with names and faces that I know. I see their wheelchairs at my kids' schools and I've dropped flowers on their freshly dug graves.\n\n\n\n\n\nA troop surge may mean that even more of my friends will be widows and more of their children will be fatherless. It certainly means more Little League teams in my community will be missing a coach, more families here will know each other only on Skype and more pets will be abandoned. It may very well mean that I will spend more years being both mother and father, and that I'll have more conversations with my children about why their daddy is always gone when so many daddies never leave. These are not things to celebrate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut right now, after just hearing our president give an inspiring speech, I'm going to consider that this plan may mean that my friends who are in Afghanistan now will finally have what they need to stay safe. Maybe it will mean that if and when my husband has to go back there, he will be in a better and safer situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, more than anything else, maybe it will mean that our nation will succeed in Afghanistan and that all of these years that my husband and I have lost together, all of these friends we've buried, all of these injuries he and others have nursed -- will have been worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not a strategist. I do not know what will take us to victory in Afghanistan. I cannot say if sending 30,000 more troops is the right or the wrong decision. All I know is that the president consulted the experts and then he sought second, third, fourth -- and who knows how many more -- opinions, and this is the solution he has reached.\n\n\n\n\n\nI commend him for making a definitive plan. I will pray for his wisdom and for the strength and safety of the troops who will be going into harm's way, just as I pray for those who are already there. I will also pray for all the families back home who are about to send their soldier or Marine into the fight.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheirs is a battle I know. For many of them, their war is just starting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebekah Sanderlin.",

Consequently, the number of boats landing in Aden has jumped from 60 to 361 since January while the number of fatalities has remained constant, according to UNHCR.\n\n\n\nThe agency attributed the surge to strife in Somalia, where riots continued in the capital city of Mogadishu for the second day Tuesday. According to news reports, Somali soldiers killed at least two people Monday during the protests over rising food prices.  Watch protesters take to the streets \u00bb\n\n\n\nSomali refugees pay as much as $150 to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of asylum. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war.\n\n\n\nYemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR.\n\n\n\nRefugees often die before reaching Yemen because of dangerous sea conditions and overcrowded vessels. Others die at the hands of their smugglers, who order the passengers to jump overboard when the Yemeni coast guard approaches the vessel.\n\n\n\nYemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen. The coast guard has also seized boats and given them Somali fishermen affected by the 2004 tsunami.",

He had not received the money as the ruling was under appeal.\n\n\n\nHeinze was found dead August 29 in his Brunswick mobile home along with six others. An eighth person died later at a hospital.\n\n\n\nPolice said all of the victims died from \"blunt force trauma,\" but they did not provide any further details.\n\n\n\nHeinze's son, Guy Heinze Jr., 22, faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths. Police suspect he acted alone, according to a statement from the Glynn County Police Department.\n\n\n\nThe younger Heinze has made his initial court appearance via closed-circuit television from the Glynn County Detention Center, his attorney, Ron Harrison, said Tuesday. His preliminary hearing likely will come next week, Harrison said.\n\n\n\nThe elder Heinze told relatives about the award days before his death, family members said. Court officials said the ruling was issued August 11, and an appeal was filed six days later.\n\n\n\nHarrison said he was aware of the award in the lawsuit but would not comment on it.\n\n\n\nPolice also are aware of it, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said, but he declined comment on whether it is being explored as a possible motive in the slayings.  Watch hints of a possible motive \u00bb\n\n\n\nHarrison said he last saw his client on Friday, as he was not required to appear with him to hear the charges read. The younger Heinze \"continues to deny any involvement in the murders and urges anyone with information to contact authorities,\" he said Tuesday. He described his client as \"not good, disappointed, upset, angry.\"\n\n\n\nHeinze called 911 to report the slayings, telling the dispatcher, \"My whole family is dead.\" He was arrested just afterward and initially was charged with tampering with evidence and making false statements to a police officer as well as facing drug charges.  Hear the 911 call \u00bb\n\n\n\nAn arrest warrant said he provided police \"with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members\" and that he removed a shotgun from the mobile home and hid it in his car.\n\n\n\nHe was arrested on the murder charges hours after being freed from jail on the initial charges. Family members said he was on his way to attend the visitation for the victims but was arrested before arriving. A police chaplain called relatives to tell them of the arrest, family members said.\n\n\n\nPolice have not released the cause of death for any of the victims. Heinze told dispatchers in his 911 call they appeared to have been beaten to death.\n\n\n\nFunerals were held Saturday for seven of the eight victims. Besides the elder Heinze, they were Brenda Gail Falagan, 49; Russell D. Toler Sr., 44; Russell D. Toler Jr., 20; Chrissy Toler, 22; Michael Toler, 19; and Michelle Toler, 15. The funeral for the eighth victim, Joseph L. West, 30, is to be held mid-month.\n\n\n\nA ninth victim, a 3-year-old, was on life support at a Savannah, Georgia, hospital as of Saturday, her grandmother said.\n\n\n\nGuy Heinze Sr.'s father, William Heinze, told CNN affiliate WJXT-TV in Jacksonville, Florida, at the funerals that he doubted his grandson was responsible for the deaths.\n\n\n\n\"We want to know what really happened,\" he said. \"The police may think they know what happened, but we want to really know the truth.\"\n\n\n\nBrunswick is about 300 miles southeast of Atlanta on Georgia's Atlantic coast.\n\n\n\nCNN's Ashley Hayes, Sean Callebs and Chris Youd contributed to this report",

  "context": "CHONGQING, China (CNN)  -- Anna He is like a lot of kids about to turn 10. She plays with her brother, fights with her sister, practices piano, hates vegetables and is adapting to her new life -- adapting, because even though she's Chinese, this little girl seems far from happy about living in China.\n\n\n\nAnna He, 9, finds it hard to adjust to life after she was returned to her biological parents, Jack and Casey He.\n\n\n\n\"I always hate staying in China,\" she says. \"It's one of the worst places I have ever been. When I first went to the big city, there was so [much] pollution and so [it] always makes me feel bad. I also don't like the smell.\"\n\n\n\nHer new life in China began after the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled last year that Anna should be returned to her biological parents, Jack and Casey He, known in China as He Shaoqiang and Qin Luo respectively.\n\n\n\nThe decision ended a six-year custody battle.\n\n\n\nAnna was born prematurely while her parents were in Memphis, Tennessee, on temporary work visas. Unable to cope financially, they decided to give her up temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\n\n\n\nThat's when Jerry and Louise Baker stepped in and agreed to take temporary custody of Anna, when she was 4 weeks old. The Bakers said they made a verbal agreement with the Hes to take care of Anna until she was 18.\n\n\n\nBut the Hes dispute that. They wanted their daughter back soon after her first birthday and eventually went to court to have their parental rights restored. After a bitter legal battle, the Hes finally prevailed and Anna was returned to her parents. Anna was given a six-month transition period to adjust to her biological family before the Hes left the United States.\n\n\n\nNow back in China, Anna is still finding it hard to adjust. Her biological parents have separated since returning to their homeland. Casey He relocated her family from Changsha, China, to Chongqing -- a sprawling mega-city on the banks of the Yangtze River with a population of 32 million. Like most of China's big cities, it's heavily polluted. During the winter, the sun rarely breaks through the heavy brown smog.\n\n\n\nJack He says the marriage is over. Casey He appears shaken when asked about her husband and why she packed up and left, with Anna and her younger brother and sister -- Andy, 8, and Avita, 6.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of things were not what I intended and not what I had hoped,\" said Casey He. She said she would talk about why she left \"one day when the kids are bigger.\"\n\n\n\nJack He says the couple disagreed over how they should raise their children. He has limited contact with his family; Anna has seen him only once in the past two months but says she doesn't miss him. Asked why, she said, \"I don't know. It's just a feeling in me.\"\n\n\n\nNow a single mother, Casey has enrolled all three children in a boarding school during the week. A tough decision, she says, but necessary -- especially for Anna, who was a straight-A student in the U.S. but now struggles because she can't speak Chinese.\n\n\n\n\"I know American people say I am bad, I take the kids to school, this is not good. But in China, the Chinese people don't think so. They study very hard,\" Casey He said.\n\n\n\nShe lives with her children in a small, two-bedroom apartment; it's clean and sparsely furnished. Casey bought a new piano for Anna and Avita, who are both taking lessons.\n\n\n\nThe apartment and school are both paid for by Casey He's brother, a wealthy businessman.\n\n\n\nLife is difficult, she says, but she has no doubt that despite Anna's struggle to fit in, the little girl is still better off with her in China rather than living in Memphis with the Bakers.\n\n\n\n\"In China one single mother take three kids -- for me, it is very hard. But I love my kids, mother's love from my heart,\" said Casey He. \"I can take care of the kids. Give them better life.\"\n\n\n\nSince her parents split, Anna has re-established regular contact with the Bakers, who call every Saturday. But after more than a year with her biological family, Anna is still unsure of where she would rather be -- with her mom or the Bakers.\n\n\n\n\"I cannot pick anyone. I would die if I would pick one,\" she said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- For most people in the world, freedom of religion is of such paramount importance and warrants all the legal and constitutional respect and protection. It is fair to say that this concept has been imbedded in numerous people's mind such that any accusation of its violation almost automatically triggers waves of condemnation.\n\n\n\nA woman reads a state media newspaper Saturday in Beijing with coverage of Tibet.\n\n\n\nThat may explain why so many people, especially in the West, are so agitated if they conclude that the Tibetan question boils down to freedom of religion, or, even worse, to its violation.\n\n\n\nHowever, their agitation will be significantly muted if they are reminded that, while freedom of religion is of paramount importance, it is equally important to keep church and state separate, lest disasters and tragedies ensue.\n\n\n\nIn this light, it is important to be reminded that what those Tibetan diaspora outside of China want to restore is a unique and anachronistic system which mixed church and state into such a lethal institution: clergy and nobles accounting for barely 5 percent of the population ruled over millions of serfs who were dealt with as chattels and animals, with no single iota of human rights. That was not ancient history, that was Tibet barely 50 years ago.  Watch a recent history of Tibet \u00bb\n\n\n\nAnyone in a major Western country advocating freedom of religion to the disregard of separation of church and state will be either marginalized or held with ultra suspicion. If a clergy does so in the United States, his church will lose tax exemption and all the other privileges of a religious institution. Mankind knows too well that mixing church and state together can be a recipe for disasters, especially in a diverse and heterogeneous society.  Watch Victor Gao discuss Tibet with CNN \u00bb\n\n\n\nTherefore, what looks as a matter of freedom of religion to many people in the West is viewed by China more importantly as a matter of separation of church and state. But why such sharp contrasts?\n\n\n\nMany people in the West eagerly embrace the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader. China would wish His Holiness were indeed nothing but a spiritual leader, otherwise many problems would have been much simpler to resolve. What looks like a spiritual leader to many in the West is viewed by China as less a spiritual leader than a political activist with dangerous political motivations.  Watch an online address by the Dalai Lama \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut why such sharp contrasts?\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that religious differences need to be handled with extra care and sensitivity. Human history has been plagued with wars and conflicts either in the name of religion or in the excuse of religion with ulterior motives. Therefore, whenever religion is touched upon, normally \"your religion for you and my religion for me\" is a good guidance for avoiding calamities. If anyone in the West wants to convert to Tibetan Buddhism and revere the Dalai Lama, or the 14th Dalai Lama to be more accurate, as not only a spiritual leader, but as the reincarnation of all the previous 13 Dalai Lamas and, more amazingly, as the reincarnation of the great God Avalokite Svara, China, rather than having any grudges against him, probably would treat him with all the due respect as a true believer. But China views many Western sympathizers of the Dalai Lama, especially those Western politicians, as having ulterior political motives aimed at infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. But why such sharp contrasts?\n\n\n\nThe Tibetan issue has become a major divider and sensationalizer in the world today. But if reason prevails over passion, the following simple truths may be shocking to learn for those much agitated people:\n\n\n\nTherefore, let's avoid mixing apples with oranges, or oranges with apples. Let's avoid any double talk. If one is using \"Free Tibet\" as an expedient alternative for \"Independent Tibet,\" then don't complain about China's wrath at his real motivation. If one is advocating freedom of religion to the disregard of the separation of church and state, then don't complain about being accused by China as a hypocrite. If one is mesmerized by the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader or even the reincarnation of God, he should not accuse China for being cool-headed enough to see through the religious veil which covers major political agendas.\n\n\n\nFor those who warn China that, being in his mid-70s, Dalai Lama's earthly years may be numbered and his eventual passing away may turn Tibetan diaspora and some Tibetans in China into violence and terror, the word of caution is that, now that the whole world is caught in deteriorating financial and economic crisis, any attempt to use violence and terror to further damage global stability and security will be condemned as a public enemy and dealt with as such. It is ludicrous to fancy that any threat of violence or terror will bent the will of China.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, China needs to continue the dialogue with the Dalai Lama and his followers both at home and abroad, and seek a mutually convenient solution. From China's perspective, the bottom line is loud and clear: if the Dalai Lama is indeed nothing but a spiritual leader, then the solution can be quick and easy; if the Dalai Lama is wearing the spiritual hat for political purposes, then nothing will be easy.\n\n\n\nAs for me, ever since my first trip to Tibet, I have been telling everyone I know that you need to visit Tibet, at least once in your lifetime, because Tibet is so unique, so extraordinary, so magnificent, so holy, that not visiting Tibet may be an eternal loss and regret.",

  "context": "Editor's note: Nancy Grace is the host of \"Nancy Grace\" on HLN nightly at 8 and 10 p.m. ET. Read an excerpt from her new novel \"The Eleventh Victim\" published by Hyperion.\n\n\n\nNancy Grace found it challenging to complete her first novel, \"The Eleventh Victim.\"\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- Readers of Nancy Grace's debut novel, \"The Eleventh Victim,\" would be forgiven if they assumed the main character is based on Grace.\n\n\n\nAfter all, the heroine of the novel becomes an Atlanta, Georgia, district attorney after her fianc\u00e9 is murdered and later relocates to New York for a fresh start.\n\n\n\nBut Grace said there are some differences between her and her protagonist. \"Hailey is a much better person than I am,\" Grace said.\n\n\n\nThe tough-as-nails anchor of the HLN show that bears her name was driven to complete her first book of fiction, which she said has been in the works for almost a decade.\n\n\n\nThe novel centers on the character of Hailey Dean, a psychology student who becomes a prosecutor after the tragic murder of her fianc\u00e9 just weeks before their wedding.\n\n\n\nThe mystery takes flight when Dean, having relocated to Manhattan and trained as a therapist, discovers that her patients are being murdered in a copycat style of an Atlanta serial killer from her past.\n\n\n\nGrace -- who is also the author of the nonfiction book \"Objection!\" -- recently spoke to CNN about the challenges of giving birth to both twins and a thriller, who might die in her next novel and what she thinks about television shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" parodying her.\n\n\n\nCNN: You are a working mother of two year-old twins. How in the world did you find time to write a book?\n\n\n\nNancy Grace: It was hard work. I had done \"Objection\" and I had an idea for a second nonfiction. I went back to my editor and I said \"Here's an idea for another nonfiction.\" She said \"Yeah, it's OK, you got anything else?\"\n\n\n\nI said \"No, but I do have an old manuscript I've been working on for a long time, a murder mystery.\" I told her it's not finished yet, I have about 300 pages.\n\n\n\nI took it over that day and the next day they told me they wanted a two-book series on Hailey Dean. Then I thought \"Oh Lord, now I've got to finish it.\" That happened around the time I got pregnant.  Watch Nancy discuss her new book \u00bb\n\n\n\nI had a difficult pregnancy. I was in a wheelchair, I threw up every day, I broke my foot during the pregnancy, so a lot of crazy things happened. Finally, after the twins came, the deadline came.\n\n\n\nI literally had to sit in the bed with the computer and force myself to finish it. I knew what was going to happen in each of the four storylines, but I had to get there.\n\n\n\nI would be up sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning. The twins, one would wake up, by the time I would get that one fed and down, the other one would wake up and then it was time to get up at 5:30.\n\n\n\nCNN: You said you knew who did it in terms of the mystery early on in the writing. So how did the book change during its development?\n\n\n\nGrace: The characters really developed. It's like getting to know a person. Read an excerpt from the novel\n\n\n\nThere are certain things Hailey simply would not do. You get to know your characters and they become richer and more intricate because you get to know the character. I would not do anything that was out of character for them.\n\n\n\nCNN: The plot and the settings sound very familiar to your own life. How much of you is in Hailey?\n\n\n\nGrace: Hailey is a much better person than I am, I can tell you that much. She's very brave. She thinks her way out of difficult and almost impossible situations, she's courageous and she's witty.\n\n\n\nI would say it's loosely based, but she's a much better heroine than I could ever be.\n\n\n\nCNN: What is more difficult, writing nonfiction or fiction?\n\n\n\nGrace: It is definitely harder to write fiction.\n\n\n\nWith nonfiction you deal with facts already in existence, but with fiction you have to create everything. Details like what color somebody's hair was to how hot it was that day.\n\n\n\nA lot of ideas for the book would come to me in the middle of the night and I forgot some of them so often that I now sleep with my two BlackBerrys near the bed. I've learned my lesson the hard way, so I will now write myself my book notes in the middle of the night.\n\n\n\nCNN: Is there anything that didn't make it into this book that you wished had?\n\n\n\nGrace: Yes, but don't worry because I saved it for the next book, which will be set in the television industry. There's going to be a lot of dead TV executives (laughing).\n\n\n\nCNN: They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so what are your thoughts on having been parodied?\n\n\n\nGrace: It's funny to me. Everything from YouTube to \"Boston Legal\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\" It's very flattering that they would think enough to make fun of me.\n\n\n\nI want [rapper] Eminem to make fun of me, but I don't think it would be very nice (laughing).",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has agreed to review a civil liberties dispute over the government's power to criminalize \"support\" of a terrorist organization.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court will review a key provision of the 2001 Patriot Act.\n\n\n\nThe justices on Wednesday accepted review of a key provision of the 2001 Patriot Act, and whether it threatens free speech rights of those who would assist non-violent activities of designated groups.\n\n\n\nSince the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, federal prosecutors have pursued \"material support\" cases against at least 120 individuals or organizations, winning convictions in about half of those cases. Nearly every such domestic terrorism-related prosecution has included that charge as part of the indictment.\n\n\n\nAt issue is whether the congressional law allows prosecution of those with knowledge of \"any service, training, expert advice or assistance\" to a foreign terrorist organization, as designated by the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nA federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, struck down several parts of the legislation, finding them too vague to satisfy the Constitution. The government then asked the high court to intervene and uphold the law.\n\n\n\nAmong those charged under the \"material support\" provision: John Walker Lindh, an American Muslim captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan; the \"Lackawanna Six,\" men from Buffalo, New York, who attended an al Qaeda training camp; several men in Portland, Oregon, who allegedly sought to travel to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban; a group of young Virginia individuals who allegedly tried to assist a Kashmir terror group; and James Ujaama, an African-American activist in Seattle, Washington.\n\n\n\nThe key plaintiff in the current appeal is the Humanitarian Law Project, a Los Angeles, California-based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate \"for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law.\" HLP sought to help the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a group active in Turkey. Known as PKK, the party was founded in the mid-1970s and has been labeled a terror organization by the United States and the European Union. Its leaders have previously called for militancy to create a separate Kurdish state in parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, where Kurds comprise a population majority.\n\n\n\nIn its appeal to the high court, the government noted that \"since its inception, the organization has waged a violent insurgency that has claimed over 22,000 lives.\"\n\n\n\nHLP claimed it wanted to advocate on behalf of the PKK before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and conduct other advisory sessions and public awareness campaigns.\n\n\n\nAnother plaintiff is an American physician who wanted to help ethnic Tamils in his native Sri Lanka. Much of the island nation is controlled by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has also fought for decades to carve an independent state. The government claims the Tamil Tigers have \"used suicide bombings and political assassinations in its campaign for independence, killing hundreds of civilians in the process.\"\n\n\n\nHLP and a group of Tamil doctors say they merely wanted \"to provide their expert medical advice on how to address the shortage of medical facilities and trained physicians\" in the region but \"they are afraid to do so because they fear prosecution for providing material support.\"\n\n\n\nThe Patriot Act was passed six weeks after the 9/11 terrorism attacks. It included amending a previous anti-terror law to strengthen the \"expert advice and assistance\" provision, making it a crime punishable by a 10- to 15-year prison sentence.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department calls the material support provision \"a vital part of the nation's effort to fight international terrorism.\" Officials told the justices the law is constitutional since \"the statute in question regulates conduct, not speech, and does not violate the First Amendment in any of its applications.\" And the government argues lawmakers properly used their authority to address a pressing problem.\n\n\n\n\"Congress has banned a broad range of material support -- regardless of whether the terrorist group claims to engage in otherwise lawful activities, and regardless of whether the support is ostensibly given to assist those supposedly lawful activities,\" said the administration's brief.\n\n\n\nThe case is Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (08-1498). Oral arguments will be held early next year, with a decision expected by the spring.",

  "context": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians.\n\n\n\nSri Lankan troops at Elephant Pass, the isthmus that connects north Jaffna peninsula to rest of the country.\n\n\n\n\"It's an incredibly serious situation,\" James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. \"We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone.\"\n\n\n\nGovernment forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced.\n\n\n\nTroops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency.\n\n\n\n\"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,\" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken.\n\n\n\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.\n\n\n\nThe rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.\n\n\n\nIt had been in rebel hands for more than nine years.\n\n\n\nThe recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.\n\n\n\n\"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had.\"\n\n\n\nDespite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict.\n\n\n\n\"This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk,\" Elder said.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations is \"calling on the ... Tamil Tigers to meet their international responsibilities and guarantee that these very large civilian populations to move freely and then can move away from the conflict and to areas where they can receive appropriate assistance,\" Elder said.\n\n\n\n\"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he said in a Sunday interview. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\"\n\n\n\nSri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place.\n\n\n\nAmnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\"\n\n\n\nThe organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict.\n\n\n\n\"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Sri Lankan authorities \"are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAt least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.\n\n\n\nOthers have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A man who allegedly tried to break into the home of a recently widowed Oklahoma woman -- who shot and killed his alleged fellow intruder after calling 911 -- was freed Thursday on bail despite a first-degree murder charge, a court clerk said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough he did not fire the fatal shot, 29-year-old Dustin Louis Stewart is charged with first-degree felony murder in the incident because if someone dies during the commission of certain crimes, such as burglary, an alleged accomplice can be charged in the death, prosecutors have said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA hearing for Stewart was held Thursday in the central Oklahoma city of Chickasha, five days after the incident. During that hearing, Stewart posted the $50,000 bond and was released, Grady County court clerk Jessica Pickle told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors recommended that $50,000 be set as the bail amount, according to a court document. Stewart was ordered not to have any contact with the alleged victim -- in this case, Sarah Dawn McKinley, who fired the fatal shot -- and to appear next in court the morning of January 20.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preliminary hearing in the case is set for May 23, the document signed by Stewart states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident has caught the nation's attention because part of the action was captured during a 911 conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome alone with her 3-month-old son, McKinley of Blanchard, Oklahoma, said she decided to make a stand when the two men tried to break into her home on New Year's Eve.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley, who had been widowed less than a week before, placed a couch in front of one door and went to the bedroom and put a bottle in her baby's mouth before calling 911, she said on HLN's \"Dr. Drew\" on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 911 operator calmly spoke with McKinley, who asked if it was permissible to shoot an intruder, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got two guns in my hand. Is it OK to shoot him if he comes in this door?\" asked McKinley, 18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, you have to do whatever you can do to protect yourself,\" dispatcher Diane Graham responded. \"I can't tell you that you can do that, but you do what you have to do to protect your baby.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, McKinley fired a 12-gauge shotgun and killed Justin Shane Martin after he entered her home, according to a Blanchard Police Department affidavit filed in court Wednesday. Martin was armed with a knife, authorities said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have to make a choice, you or him. I chose my son over him,\" McKinley said to CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Assistant District Attorney James Walters told CNN that McKinley will not be charged because she acted in self-defense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A person has the right to protect themselves, their family and their property,\" Walters said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the 911 operator's guidance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would agree with that advice,\" the prosecutor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not uncommon for charges to be filed against an alleged accomplice in cases where two people are committing a crime and a death occurs, even that of a co-conspirator, said Trent Baggett, assistant executive coordinator at the Oklahoma District Attorneys Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's all dependent upon if the situation warrants it and the facts warrant it,\" he said. \"... If in the commission of a qualifying offense, someone gets killed, then yes, (first-degree murder charges) can and probably will be filed upon the person who doesn't die.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if they didn't pull the trigger themselves? \"Under Oklahoma law, it doesn't matter,\" Baggett said. And people have been convicted of first-degree murder under such circumstances, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham was the first of two 911 operators to speak with McKinley.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dispatcher told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Wednesday she learned in training that she could not tell a caller to shoot someone but, \"as a mother, I wanted her to protect her baby.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She did a very good job in keeping her (McKinley) calm,\" Grady County Sheriff Art Kell said of Graham. \"Her job is to make sure the person on the phone is comfortable ... to give them support.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley was on the phone with a second dispatcher when she pulled the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley's husband died of cancer on Christmas Day, Walters said. Evidence indicates Martin and Stewart may have been looking for painkillers or other drugs taken by McKinley's ill husband, the assistant prosecutor said. Investigators found no such drugs, he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice said Stewart told them Martin knew McKinley's husband had died, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Martin suspected prescription drugs would be inside the home, the station reported, citing court documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley said she believes the men were coming after her, rather than intending to commit a robbery.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the affidavit, the men approached McKinley's mobile home Saturday afternoon. Martin had devised a plan to burglarize the residence, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStewart told investigators he and Martin ingested hydrocodone about 30 minutes before reaching the rural home, the affidavit states.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin \"aggressively\" knocked on the doors of the home and gained entry by hitting one of them with his shoulder, police said. Stewart said \"he heard a gunshot after Martin entered the residence,\" and Stewart then \"fled on foot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley said she had pushed the couch against the door to deter entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When he busted in the door I saw something shimmering in his hand,\" the mother told HLN. \"I thought it was a pistol at first, but it was a 12-inch hunting knife. I didn't know (that) until after I shot and killed him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin, 24, was found between the door and a couch with a knife clutched in his gloved left hand, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's calls to police in Blanchard, about 25 miles south of downtown Oklahoma City, were not immediately returned.\n\n\n\n\n\nStewart's attorney, Stephen Buzin, told CNN he would not comment on specifics of the case against his client. \"We will let the facts come out at trial and feel comfortable with his innocence,\" the attorney said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin recently had approached McKinley's home, saying he wanted to introduce himself, Walters said. The man said he worked for the owner of the property on which McKinley lived, she told HLN.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley, who in addition to the shotgun was also armed with a pistol, was on the phone with authorities for 21 minutes, Walters said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She remained as calm as one could under the circumstances and had the forethought and called 911, as everyone should,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley was asked on \"Dr. Drew\" whether she regretted shooting Martin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No. We could have been in a whole different situation if I hadn't done it,\" she replied.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about this story from CNN affiliate KWTV.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch ISSUES with Jane Velez-Mitchell Monday through Sunday at 7pm ET on HLN.

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Federal investigators trying to determine why a Delta Air Lines jet landed on a taxiway instead of the runway in Atlanta on Monday morning say the runway was illuminated, but that approach lights and a ground-based instrument that helps pilots line up with the runway were off.\n\n\n\nThe pilots of the plane that landed at the Atlanta airport have been relieved from flying duties pending probes.\n\n\n\nThe incident happened at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world's busiest. But it occurred shortly before dawn, when airport operations are slow.\n\n\n\nDelta Flight 60, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was cleared to land on a main runway around 6:05 a.m., but it landed instead on nearby Taxiway M, which runs parallel to the runway, said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.\n\n\n\nThe departure taxiway, which can be filled with aircraft during peak hours, was empty at the time, and the plane landed safely, officials said. No one was injured, and there was no damage to the taxiway.\n\n\n\nThe Boeing 767 aircraft had 182 passengers and a crew of 11.\n\n\n\nThe FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and Delta Air Lines are investigating. The pilots of the aircraft were placed on nonflight status, Delta said.\n\n\n\nThe NTSB on Wednesday confirmed that a \"check pilot\" on the flight was sick, and the crew had declared a medical emergency. It was not clear what, if any, role that played in the mishap.\n\n\n\nSources familiar with the incident say that Flight 60 originally was scheduled to land on Runway 27L (left), the active runway at that time, but was \"sidestepped\" to Runway 27R (right). Pilots commonly ask to be \"sidestepped\" to Runway 27R -- and air traffic controllers commonly offer 27R -- because it is closer to the terminal and pilots can shave minutes from a trip.\n\n\n\nIn this case, it is not clear whether the pilot made the request, or the air traffic controllers made the offer. Nor is it clear why the change was made -- whether to shave time from the flight, or because of the medical emergency on the aircraft or  some other reason.\n\n\n\nBut after being given permission to land on Runway 27R, the plane went too far to the right, landing on Taxiway M.\n\n\n\nThe runway was marked with yellow lights, while the taxiway was marked with blue lights, one person familiar with the incident said.\n\n\n\nThe NTSB said the runway lights on 27R were illuminated, but a \"localizer\" and approach lights for the runway were off.\n\n\n\nOfficials said the weather at the airport was clear, and the NTSB said the wind was calm at 10 mph. The sky was dark, with twilight still more than an hour away.\n\n\n\nThe NTSB said a \"check airman\" was in the cockpit with the captain and first officer during the flight, but became ill and moved to the cabin for the remainder of the flight. Check airman are company pilots who watch over crew members during significant flights, such as when a first officer becomes a captain, when a pilot is making a maiden international flight, or over mountainous terrain for the first time. The NTSB said it is uncertain why the check airman was on the Delta flight.\n\n\n\nDelta spokesman Anthony Black said the airline is cooperating with the FAA and the NTSB and conducting its own investigation. The pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying, he said.\n\n\n\nThe incident came just two weeks after the FAA announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent this year. Close calls in 2007 at some of the busiest U.S. airports prompted the FAA to take action to reduce the risk of runway incursions and wrong runway departures. There were 24 serious runway incursions that year, eight of them involving commercial carriers.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- The assault began at dawn, as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nLt. Cason Shrode said that in less than two minutes, his team's generator was hit and they were out of power.\n\n\n\nThe insurgency was so fierce, according to one soldier, that the troops couldn't get to their mortars to fire back.\n\n\n\n\"They were under heavy enemy contact,\" Sgt. Jayson Souter said, describing the October 3 attack that pinned his comrades at Combat Outpost Keating, a remote base in Nuristan province.\n\n\n\nFour servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot, and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel.\n\n\n\nThe United States says about 200 insurgents -- mostly local fighters, with some Taliban organizers and leaders -- had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains.  Watch more about their story \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe battle started early on October 3 and lasted for 12 hours. At the end, eight American soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed and buildings at the outpost were destroyed.\n\n\n\nFire support officer 1st Lt. Cason Shrode said the initial round \"didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.\" There was a lull and then there was a heavy attack.\n\n\n\n\"We started receiving a heavy volley of fire. Probably 90 seconds into the fight they ended up hitting one of our generators so we lost all power,\" Shrode said in the interview posted online by the Defense Department. \"At that point I knew that this was something bigger than normal.\"\n\n\n\nTroops called in air support. Helicopter gunner Chad Bardwell said he had to confirm the fighters he saw on ridgelines were the enemy because he had never seen such a large group of insurgents.\n\n\n\n\"We tried to stop them as they were coming down the hill. ... We were taking fire pretty much the entire day,\" he said in the Defense Department interview.\n\n\n\nChief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, the Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a \"time-consuming endeavor\" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was \"significant,\" but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons.\n\n\n\n\"One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain,\" he said in the same interview.\n\n\n\nLewallen said the valley sits beneath mountains to the west and north.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of cover so you really can't detect the enemy until they start moving again,\" he said, adding that it was tough for medical evacuation aircraft to land \"because we were still trying to control\" the outpost.\n\n\n\nThe intense assault on Keating led to fires. There were five main buildings at the post and four of them burned. Soldiers eventually ended up going into one building.\n\n\n\n\"The next morning it was pretty much ash besides that one building. I mean that's the way to describe it. Most of it had burned down. So we were pretty much at one building and the rest was just a shadow of what it used to be,\" Shrode said in the Defense Department interview.\n\n\n\nLewallen said what came together was \"air-ground integration.\"\n\n\n\n\"All the training we've done before deploying here; it really clicked that day,\" he said in the interview. \"We started realizing that the guys on the ground knew what they needed to tell us to get the job done. It made things that much easier.\"\n\n\n\nHe disputed media reports suggesting that there weren't enough weapons and troops. He said 40 minutes into the fight, air power arrived.\n\n\n\n\"We had everything we needed. It was just a big attack with a lot of people. Bad things happen -- but I think we did well, under the circumstances.\"\n\n\n\nReflecting on the fight, Souter said, \"Everybody basically came together and in the mix of it all, they were donating blood for the wounded that we had. They all pulled together to make sure that we can pull our boys out of this.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Lately it's hard to tell the difference between a presidential debate and \"The Jerry Springer Show.\" Yeah, I know. Some of you have been saying this for months. But my comment isn't a criticism of the candidates, but the live audience. I was hoping this audience \"whoop\" factor would go away over the long debate season, but it has only grown worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre they serving alcohol at the debates? It seems like it. In last night's Republican presidential debate, held in the Myrtle Beach Convention Center in South Carolina, the chaotic audience once again played an awkward role in the questions and answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this matter? On these presidential debates, the vocal live audiences have shown themselves to be more disruptive than productive. And I've seen debate judges (people who should know better) in intercollegiate tournaments have their decisions influenced by a noisy audience \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even judges trained to be impartial and objective.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the judges are you, the audience. I know everyone believes they can't be swayed like this, but it still happens (even to me, which is one of the reasons I watch the presidential debates alone. I don't want anyone influencing my analysis). There is even a name for it in the literature. Emotional contagion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it was apparent Monday night -- fanboys (and fangirls) who were every bit as rabid as a football crowd. The only people missing were face-paint girl and shirtless guy. (Of course, it's hard to tell on television how much of the crowd participated in the cheering and booing.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was especially annoying because the live audience was booing their disapproval at inappropriate times. Two examples. Juan Williams, one of the moderators, was asking Mitt Romney about his immigration policies when he was interrupted in mid-question. Williams had begun the question by stating that Mitt Romney's father was born in Mexico. \"Boo!\" came the shouts from the audience. What? What in the world were they booing? I still have no idea. It could have been Juan Williams, the question, Romney's father, or Romney's position on immigration. It made no sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the live audience ganged up on Ron Paul. Remember, Paul has some of the more unconventional foreign policy positions for a conservative Republican audience. And Paul was not at his best last night (I've heard him defend his argument much more effectively) when explaining his position on the military operation that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the audience mistimed its reaction and used most of its vitriol immediately after Paul said the American people wouldn't like it if the United States were treated the same way it treated other countries. Paul reiterated his stance that we should use the golden rule -- do unto others as you would have them do unto you -- when the boos rang out. I couldn't believe it. I was indeed hearing this correctly. The crazed audience at the presidential debate actually booed the golden-freaking-rule. What's next? Helping old women cross the street? \"Boo! ... Villain!\" Puppies? \"Hiss ... Shame!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the audience was equally annoying when applauding. Remember: Cheering should prove nothing to you in a debate except that some candidates are better than others at stacking the live audience with supporters. I'm also beginning to wonder if there is an \"applause\" sign that lights up so some of the slower audience operatives will remember when to react.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor their part, the candidates handled the live audience pretty well. After all, politicians are used to verbal feedback in public speeches and town hall meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy advice today is for the general viewing public at home. Simply keep in mind that the opinions of the live audience are not necessarily reflective of anything, including logic. And try to resist being influenced by overzealous fools watching the debate from the cheap seats. If this continues, we're in danger of letting the loud few influence the silent many watching at home. I certainly hope we can reverse this trend. Because I'd hate to see the next step: Measuring presidential debates by audience noise-meters with a needle that moves up and down. After all, higher decibel levels must indicate better policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin CNN Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.",

  "context": "Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- European Union leaders named Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as the first \"president of Europe\" Thursday, edging out former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for a still-vaguely defined job.\n\n\n\n\"I did not seek this high position, and I didn't take any steps to achieve it,\" Van Rompuy said in accepting the job. \"But tonight, I take on this task with conviction and with enthusiasm.\"\n\n\n\nVan Rompuy, a 62-year-old, soft-spoken fan of Japanese poetry, will become the face of European Union and represent its 27 member nations at summits overseas. His conservative government took office in December 2008.\n\n\n\nThe Belgian is \"well known as a consensus builder,\" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who added the selection was unanimous. And Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission -- the executive arm of the EU -- called Van Rompuy's selection \"a tribute to Belgium,\" the EU's host country.\n\n\n\n\" I think the European Union also expressed its gratitude for the work of Belgium and the constant support that this country at the heart of Europe has given to our common project,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Van Rompuy pledged to lead the EU through a process of \"dialogue, unity and action.\"\n\n\n\n\"A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation,\" he said. \"As president of the council, I will listen carefully to everyone, and I will make sure that all deliberations turn into results for everyone.\"\n\n\n\nThe presidency was created by the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, which came into force this month after years of torturous negotiations. Van Rompuy will serve a two-and-a-half-year term, replacing the six-month presidency of the bloc that rotated among the heads of its member states.\n\n\n\nBut while the EU prides itself on being a club of democracies, the process of choosing its new leader was far from transparent or open.\n\n\n\nThe people of Europe are getting no say, not even through their parliamentarians. Van Rompuy's new job was announced after a closed-door dinner for the EU's heads of state and government.\n\n\n\nThe Belgian defended the process, telling reporters the selection was made by leaders \"who were all democratically chosen.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was chosen on the basis of a treaty,\" he said. \"The treaty stipulates the procedure. The treaty was democratically approved by 27 member states.\"\n\n\n\nThe EU leaders also named Catherine Ashton, a British trade commissioner and member of the House of Lords, as the union's High Commissioner -- its equivalent of a foreign minister. Unlike Van Rompuy, who was chosen by leaders of the EU's member states, Ashton must be confirmed by the European Parliament.\n\n\n\nBlair, who led Britain from 1997 to 2007, is currently the EU's Mideast envoy. He had been the early favorite for the presidency in recent weeks -- but Brown, his successor, realized that he lacked support among key decision-makers for new post, a Brown representative told CNN earlier.\n\n\n\nAccording his backers, who at first included French President Nicolas Sarkozy, he was just the sort of world-renowned figure to win attention for the EU and enable it to exercise its weight in world affairs. One Indian official told CNN before the announcement, \"If the EU chooses as its worldwide representative the prime minister of Belgium or Luxembourg, I am not sure our leaders will have the time to meet him.\"\n\n\n\nBut others were soon arguing that Blair's support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and his close alliance with former U.S. President George W. Bush made him a divisive figure in Europe. And as the one man who might have been able to take Britain into the European single currency, he had not even attempted to do so while he was Britain's prime minister.\n\n\n\nPublic backing from Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, a joke figure to much of Europe and another Bush ally, did not help.\n\n\n\nBrown had realized earlier that Blair did not have enough support among key decision-makers to snag the new post, a Brown representative told CNN earlier.\n\n\n\nCNN Political Contributor Robin Oakley contributed to this report.",

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- The son of the late Gambino family crime boss John Gotti is set to stand trial in federal court in New York on Monday on murder and racketeering charges that could put him in prison for life if he is convicted.\n\n\n\n'Junior' Gotti's lawyer, Charles Carnesi, talks with reporters outside the federal courthouse.\n\n\n\nThree previous racketeering trials against John \"Junior\" Gotti, 45, have ended in mistrials in New York.\n\n\n\nThe government says it has learned since his previous trial, \"that Gotti had participated in three murders, that Gotti had run a multi-million dollar cocaine trafficking network, that Gotti had overseen a systematic effort to tamper with trial juries, grand juries and witnesses, and that Gotti had participated in various other violent crimes,\" according to court documents filed by prosecutors.\n\n\n\nThe defense claims the newest round of charges is part of the government's ongoing quest to convict Gotti.\n\n\n\nThe current case was moved to New York in December from Florida, where the original indictment was handed up.\n\n\n\nA superseding indictment was filed in the case on August 3. In the first indictment, Gotti was only charged with violating the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.\n\n\n\nThe superseding indictment formally charged Gotti with the drug-related murders of two men -- allegations mentioned as part of the first indictment -- along with the RICO charge. The RICO law is used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family.\n\n\n\nGotti's defense attorneys, however, allege in court filings that \"the prosecution has engaged in a 'win at all costs' campaign riddled with misconduct.\"\n\n\n\n\"The prosecution charges the same conspiracy, albeit with new garnishments,\" said one filing from July. \"After having received frustrating results in three separate trials, the case was hijacked to the Middle District of Florida in a shameful attempt to forum shop or judge shop or both.\"\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors, meanwhile, say in court filings that Gotti's allegations he is a victim of a government vendetta are unfounded. Since Gotti's previous trials, prosecutors maintain, they have \"uncovered extensive new evidence of Gotti's criminal conduct in the course of investigating and prosecuting another Gambino family captain.\"\n\n\n\nThe indictment alleges that Gotti was at times an \"associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss\" in the Gambino family, and also served on a \"committee of captains\" formed in the early 1990s to assist in family administration.\n\n\n\n\"The principal purpose of the GCF (Gambino crime family) Enterprise was to generate money ... for the GCF Enterprise members,\" the indictment says.\n\n\n\n\"This purpose was implemented,\" the indictment continued, \"through various criminal activities, including criminal acts involving the felonious manufacturing, importing, receiving, concealing, buying, selling and otherwise dealing in narcotics and other dangerous drugs, extortion, armed and unarmed robbery, armed home invasions, illegal gambling, extortionate credit transactions, theft and bribery.\"\n\n\n\nTo further their activities, family members threatened and caused economic injury, the indictment says, as well as threatening and using physical violence \"ranging from simple assault to murder.\"\n\n\n\nThe two murders Gotti is charged with are those of George Grosso, who died in December 1988 in Queens, and Bruce John Gotterup, slain in November 1991 in Queens.\n\n\n\nThe indictment also accuses Gotti in connection with a third murder, that of Louis DiBono in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center, but does not allege that murder was drug-related.\n\n\n\nAlthough the murder charges carry a potential death sentence, prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty against Gotti.\n\n\n\nThe trial will be the latest chapter in a long legal saga.\n\n\n\nIn late 2006, a third mistrial was declared in a federal case against Gotti on charges including racketeering and extortion. Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti, who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti's father on his program. Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against the younger Gotti.\n\n\n\nAt the time of Gotti's arrest in August 2008 on the latest charges, his attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters he \"was very disappointed to have to go through all this again.\"\n\n\n\nCarnesi continued, \"You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year, to feel that, OK, perhaps it's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion, no more. It's very disheartening for him to be back here again.\"\n\n\n\nGotti's father, John Gotti Sr., was nicknamed the \"Teflon Don\" because prosecutors had trouble making charges against him stick. He died in prison of throat cancer in 2002.",

  "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The ongoing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq \"shows that the (Iraqi) government and the occupation are not serious about the withdrawal,\" a key Shiite cleric in the country said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA crowd gathers Tuesday after a deadly bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk.\n\n\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr made the statement on his Web site a day after U.S. forces withdrew from Iraqi cities and towns in accordance with the security agreement between the United States and Iraq.\n\n\n\nAbout 131,000 American troops remain in the country, on bases and in outposts outside of population centers.\n\n\n\n\"The withdrawal should include all the occupation forces: army, intelligence, militias, and security companies and others. Otherwise, the withdrawal will be uncompleted and useless,\" al-Sadr said.\n\n\n\n\"We want a withdrawal and stopping the interference with Iraqi political, social and economic affairs,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nAl-Sadr commands the loyalty of the Mehdi Army, one of the largest independent militias in the country. His agreement to a cease-fire with the government and its allies is considered a key factor in reducing the level of violence in the country.\n\n\n\nBut he seemed to suggest Wednesday that Iraqis had the right to attack foreign forces in the country -- if not Iraqi security forces.\n\n\n\n\"If the occupation forces violate this claimed withdrawal, even with a government cover, then the people of Iraq will have all the right to express their opinion in a peaceful way, and the right to self-defense on condition of not harming the Iraqi people and the security forces,\" he said.\n\n\n\nUnder an agreement signed in the waning days of the Bush administration, all U.S. forces will be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Most will be gone by August 2010 under the withdrawal plan laid out by President Barack Obama, Bush's successor.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. troops who remain are now tasked with supporting Iraqi troops and police, and must seek Iraqi permission to launch operations in the cities.\n\n\n\nthe top U.S. general in the country said Tuesday that much of the country was safe. \"There is not widespread violence in Iraq,\" Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a video conference from Baghdad.\n\n\n\n\"There's still gonna be bumps in the road. There's still gonna be violence here,\" he added.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the death toll from a huge blast in northern Iraq rose to 35, local security officials said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe car bombing took place in a busy commercial district in a predominantly Kurdish area of Kirkuk early Tuesday evening when the neighborhood was busy, security sources said.\n\n\n\nAbout 17 shops and houses were destroyed and 95 people were wounded, a police official in the Iraqi city added.\n\n\n\nKirkuk is about 378 kilometers (235 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad.\n\n\n\nCNN's Yousif Bassil and Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report.",

It is widely considered to be the definitive \"sports sedan.\" The '07 328i was propelled by a 3.0-liter 230-hp inline six-cylinder engine, which you can find mated to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Reports also recommended the 3-Series coupe and convertible that joined BMW's model line-up in '07.  AOL Autos: Used BMW\n\n\n\n\n\n2004 BMW M3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M3 is the top-of-the-line, high-performance-tuned version of the 3-series coupe. Performance power, therefore, is much higher than the other 3-Series editions. It came as a coupe or convertible, and churned out 333 horses. The M3 is often favorably compared to the Porsche 911 when it comes to quick acceleration, crisp braking and taking tough corners at brisk speeds without breaking a sweat.\n\n\n\n\n\n2007 Infiniti FX35\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the marketplace surely is not lacking for luxury crossovers. Here is yet another one that appeals to luxury buyers with its balance of SUV-type spaciousness, pampering amenities, deft handling and burly engine muscle. For '07, the FX35 was a two-wheel-drive vehicle powered by a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti\n\n\n\n\n\n2006 & 2007 Infiniti M\n\n\n\n\n\nInfiniti's M series is another winner, which seamlessly synergizes sleek styling, aggressive engine performance and a bevy of luxo-line amenities. It comes in both the M-35 and M-45. During the last used-model year, '07, the primary distinction between the two was that the M35 was powered by a V6 that kicked out 275 horses, while the M45 muscled up to a 325-hp V8. Luxury features included standard leather seats with heating and ventilation, and optional 10-way power adjustments for the driver's seat.\n\n\n\n\n\nLexus\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like in the $24,000-to-$30,000 category, Consumer Reports recommended a slew of world-beating used Lexus models in this segment: the '06-'07 6-cylinder GS RWD; the '07 GS450h Hybrid; '05-'07 GX; '07 IS; '04-'07 LS; '03-'06 LX and '06-'07 RX. AOL Autos: Used Lexus\n\n\n\n\n\nLexus has placed No 1 in the JD Power Dependability Survey every year for the last 12 years - until '07, when another carmaker, Buick, finally tied them for first.\n\n\n\n\n\nPorsche 911 (various years)\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Reports included the '98 911 in the $24,000 to $30,000 category. Here, the model years get more recent as the price range climbs. The 911 went through some changes over this time period, of course, but all have been anointed with the \"supercar\" appellation. AOL Autos: Used Porsche\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd by the latest recommended used-model year, the '07, you could choose among various styles and engine sizes, including the Carrera, with its 3.6-L 325-hp flat-six plant; the Carrera S and S Cabriolet, with the 3.8-L 355 hp V6; the 911 Turbo, with twin-turbocharged 480 hp six-cylinder engine; and the GT3 track model, powered by a high-revving 415-hp six-cylinder engine.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday called on the state bar to overlook a technical error and allow a paralyzed law school graduate to take the bar exam next week.\n\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger says a technical error shouldn't stop the law school graduate from taking the bar exam.\n\n\n\n\"It is outrageous that someone who has overcome so much in life is penalized by a bureaucratic error that prevents her from taking the bar exam next week,\" the governor said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"Government should work for the people, not against them, and I'm calling on the state bar to allow Sara Granda to take next week's test. Sara is a fighter, and I am with her all the way.\"\n\n\n\nThe state bar's Web site never processed Granda's application for Tuesday's test because California's Department of Rehabilitation paid her $600 fee with a check, according to the Sacramento Bee. The Web site requires a credit card number, but Granda said she was assured by a state bar representative that she was properly registered with the check, the newspaper reported.\n\n\n\nGranda, 29, a University of California-Davis Law School graduate, has petitioned the California Supreme Court to allow her to take Tuesday's test.\n\n\n\nShe said she was \"surprised\" to hear about Schwarzenegger's statement in her defense.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not used to a lot of attention,\" she told CNN television affiliate KCRA. She said she went to the governor's office last week, \"but they wouldn't let me in.\"\n\n\n\n\"So I knew there was no way that the governor was going to get involved,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGranda was paralyzed from the neck down after a car accident in 1997, when she was 17. The accident happened a month before she was to attend California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, on a full scholarship, according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\n\n\nGranda, who has been studying 11 hours a day for the bar exam with the help of assistants, said she wants the state of California to resolve the matter because it spent about $100,000 for her education.\n\n\n\n\"I worked very, very hard for every cent,\" she told KCRA. \"So for everything to come together in the end and for it to just kind of fall through on such a minor, minor detail.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Self-confessed BlackBerry addict President Barack Obama may not have to kick the thumbing habit after all, despite the concerns of a notoriously technophobic White House.\n\n\n\nObama was a self-confessed BlackBerry addict during his White House campaign.\n\n\n\n\"The president has a BlackBerry,\" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday, clearing up weeks of speculation about whether President Obama would be able to hold on to a cherished method of communicating.\n\n\n\nThe decision to allow Obama to keep a smartphone is \"a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends,\" Gibbs told the media in his first press conference since the inauguration.\n\n\n\n\"Use will be limited and the security is enhanced to ensure his ability to communicate but to do so effectively,\" Gibbs also said. \"And to do so in a way that is protected.\"\n\n\n\nThe press secretary refused to provide more details about the new president's device, already being called the \"BarackBerry.\"  Watch CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the president's new phone \u00bb\n\n\n\nObama was often seen hunched over the mobile e-mail cell phone device during his election campaign and even featured at No. 2 on one celebrity Web site's list of obsessive BlackBerry users.\n\n\n\nBut, like previous Oval Office incumbents, Obama had been expected to take a vow of technological celibacy following his inaugural oath on Tuesday, despite telling CNBC in an interview that security officials would have to \"pry it out of my hands.\" He said a mobile device would help him stay in touch with the real world. Should President Obama be allowed to keep his BlackBerry? Tell us what you think\n\n\n\nE-mail has long been treated with suspicion by the Secret Service because of fears it could be hacked into by foreign espionage agencies, or that sensitive information could reach the public domain via a single mistaken strike of the \"send\" key.\n\n\n\nPresident George W. Bush was forced to give up using e-mail when he took charge, while President Bill Clinton sent just two e-mails during his administration -- one to test that the system worked and the second to veteran astronaut John Glenn before his trip into space in 1998.\n\n\n\nThere are also concerns that mobile devices such as the BlackBerry, which contain built-in GPS technology, could be hacked, revealing the president's location within a few feet.\n\n\n\nBut according to reports Thursday, Obama may actually have been issued a spy-proof alternative to his favorite toy.\n\n\n\nWriting on his blog for the Atlantic magazine, Marc Ambinder reports that the National Security Agency has approved a $3,350 smartphone -- inevitably dubbed the \"BarackBerry\" -- for Obama's use.\n\n\n\nThe exclusive Sectera Edge, made by General Dynamics, is reportedly capable of encrypting top secret voice conversations and handling classified documents.\n\n\n\nBut Obama may have pushed his Secret Service handlers' technological patience far enough. Ambinder also reports that instant messaging in the White House will still be a definite no-no.\n\n\n\nCNN's Martina Stewart contributed to this report.",

  "context": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- The atmosphere was tense in Cape Town on Friday after xenophobic violence that has left more than 40 dead in Johannesburg spread to South Africa's largest city.\n\n\n\nImmigrants from Mozambique line up in Primrose, South Africa, to board buses back home.\n\n\n\nClashes overnight resulted in one death and 15 arrests and the evacuations of 420 foreign nationals, a police official in Cape Town said.\n\n\n\n\"Crowds of people went on a rampage, looting and carrying out acts of violence,\" said Cape Town Police Superintendent Billy Jones. They were charged with public violence and are to appear in court Monday.\n\n\n\nOne foreign national, a Somali, died when he was run over by a vehicle as he tried to escape the angry crowds, Jones said. Twelve people suffered minor injuries.\n\n\n\nHe said Friday was tense but calm, with state and local police stationed throughout the area.\n\n\n\nJack Bloom of the opposition party Democratic Alliance told CNN on Friday that government troops were helping police ward off violence in Johannesburg.\n\n\n\nAid workers and volunteers were providing tents, food and supplies at the police stations. Bloom estimated that about 2,000 foreigners had sought haven at those locations.\n\n\n\nIt was the first violence in the coastal city since a wave of xenophobia began about two weeks ago in Johannesburg, resulting in at least 42 deaths.\n\n\n\nThe foreign nationals were transported from the city after angry crowds formed at a public meeting seeking to calm tensions, Jones told CNN. They were being housed at community centers and churches.\n\n\n\nThe attacks in South Africa have forced thousands of immigrants to flee, prompting neighboring Mozambique to declare a state of emergency on Friday. Desperate stories of those fleeing violence\n\n\n\nThe country's Foreign Minister Oldemiro Baloi said the decision was taken after about 10,000 Mozambicans fled from South Africa.\n\n\n\nCNN's Robyn Curnow reported long lines of people -- including many from Zimbabwe and Mozambique -- waiting for buses in Johannesburg to take them home.\n\n\n\nBloom, from Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, said the attacks on foreigners who fled to South Africa for a better life has become a \"humanitarian crisis.\"\n\n\n\nSouth African President Thabo Mbeki has approved the deployment of the army to help stop the attacks, which have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders.\n\n\n\nAbout 28,000 people have been displaced by the violence, Hangwani Malaudzi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Safety and Security said. And more than 400 have been arrested for crimes ranging from murder, to causing a public disturbance, he said.\n\n\n\nThe country has also seen a disturbing throwback to the 1980s apartheid-era lynching tactic of \"necklacing,\" which was widely used in the townships at the time.\n\n\n\nUsed on suspected informants, the \"necklace\" is a car tire, filled with petrol, put around the person's neck and set alight.\n\n\n\nThe victims are mainly immigrants and refugees from other parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, where a devastated economy has sent at least two million people across the border in search of a better life.\n\n\n\nSome say the attacks stem from a long-standing feeling among locals that the number of immigrants in South Africa results in shortages of jobs and essential needs.\n\n\n\nInadequate housing, a lack of running water and electricity, the rising prices of food, and escalating crime -- nearly 20,000 people were slain in South Africa last year -- add to the resentment.  Watch analysis of reasons behind xenophobic attacks \u00bb\n\n\n\nAccording to South Africa's latest census, the country has about 45 million people. The South African Department of Human Affairs estimates that more than 4 million people reside in South Africa illegally, but that figure is based on a 10-year-old study and some feel the number of immigrants in South Africa is much higher.\n\n\n\nSome say that millions have recently fled to South Africa from Zimbabwe because of violence there since the county's stalled election.\n\n\n\nA presidential run-off between long-time leader President Robert Mugabe and his opposition challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is scheduled for June 27 in Zimbabwe -- three months after the initial vote.\n\n\n\nZimbabwe also is in the midst of an economic collapse, with nearly 80 percent unemployment.",

  "context": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A Brazilian supreme court judge on Tuesday suspended a lower court's order that would have given custody of a 9-year-old boy to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, where he was to be reunited with his American father.\n\n\n\nDavid Goldman has been fighting for custody of his son, Sean, since the boy's mother took him to Brazil in 2004.\n\n\n\nJudge Marco Aurelio argued against taking Sean Richard Goldman from what has been his home for almost five years to the United States \"in an abrupt manner.\"\n\n\n\nDoing so, he wrote in his order published on the court's Web site, could subject the boy to psychological harm.\n\n\n\nThe decision, which means the entire Brazilian supreme court will take up the case, comes a day after a superior court justice ordered Sean taken Wednesday to the U.S. Consulate in Rio and handed over to his father, David Goldman, who arrived Tuesday from New Jersey to pick up his son.\n\n\n\nThe two were separated in June 2004 when the boy's Brazilian mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, told Goldman -- to whom she was then married -- that she was taking the boy on a two-week vacation to Brazil.  Watch Goldman describe his fight to get his son back \u00bb\n\n\n\nMother and son never returned. Instead, Bianchi stayed in Brazil, where she divorced Goldman and married a Brazilian lawyer.\n\n\n\nBut in September, Bianchi's death during childbirth led Goldman to renew his efforts to regain custody of their son.\n\n\n\nSean, who has been living with his half-sister and his stepfather, was to have spent a 30-day adaptation period in the United States before his father gained full custody.\n\n\n\nThat prospect sparked outrage from an attorney representing the boy's Brazilian relatives. \"The child wasn't heard,\" lawyer Sergio Tostes said. \"The child said many times that he wanted to stay in Brazil. This is not human, and it is a cruelty.\"\n\n\n\nThe case has attracted high-level attention. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to the case Monday, telling reporters, \"I also wanted just to take this opportunity to recognize the decision by the Brazilian federal court today ordering a young American boy, Sean Goldman, to be reunited with his father, David. It's taken a long time for this day to come, but we will work with the Goldman family and the Brazilian government, with the goal of ensuring this young boy's return.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Goldman's attorney, Patricia Apy, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\n\n\nCNN's Rob Frehse and Alessandra Castelli contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The stock market crashed. Wall Street panicked. People stashed silver and gold under mattresses while businesses shut doors across America.\n\n\n\nPeople in Detroit, Michigan, line up for food at the Capuchin Soup Kitchen.\n\n\n\nWe're talking, of course, about the Great Depression ... of 1873.\n\n\n\nThat's the event that Scott Reynolds Nelson cites when asked to give an historical perspective on today's sputtering economy. The historian says the economic panic of 1873 started with the same toxic mix as today's crisis: risky mortgages, a stock market dive and the use of complex financial instruments that few understood.\n\n\n\n\"Until 1929, when people used the word[s] Great Depression they referred to 1873,\" says Nelson, a professor of history at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\"That was a worldwide international depression that started with the banks. That's what we're seeing now. This looks like 1873.\"\n\n\n\nThe nation's economic crisis is not only causing people to look more closely at their 401(k) account statements. They're also turning to their history books. Politicians and commentators routinely invoke the Great Depression and other historical events to describe today's economic crisis.  Watch the debate over 'Depression' talk \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut how fair is that historical analogy?\n\n\n\nWhy Great Depression comparisons may be unfair\n\n\n\nJames Kolari, an economist at Texas A&M University, says the nation experienced two \"rough\" recessions in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. A recession is generally defined as a decline in the Gross Domestic Product for two or more consecutive quarters.\n\n\n\nHe says it's not fair to compare the current economic crisis to the Great Depression, because the federal government was far more passive in the 1920s.\n\n\n\n\"We let 15,000 out of 30,000 banks fail,\" he says. \"Government efforts to jump-start the economy were slow and relatively weak until President [Franklin] Roosevelt came along with the New Deal.\"\n\n\n\nKolari says people can learn more by looking at Japan. He says the U.S. economy is facing the same crisis as Japan in the 1990s when the Japanese economy collapsed from a real estate bubble and never fully recovered.\n\n\n\n\"The Japanese government moved too slowly and not aggressively enough,\" he says. \"The problems festered.\"\n\n\n\nDavid George, a professor of economics at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, says the federal government better protects ordinary people from financial ruin today than during the first stages of the Great Depression. Today we reap the benefits of policies created during that era, George says.\n\n\n\nRoosevelt helped create New Deal legislation to insure bank deposits and enacted other modern relief efforts like unemployment compensation to help those in distress.\n\n\n\n\"By any measure, incomes were lower then than now, and the worst imaginable loss of output today would still keep the nation well above where we were back then,\" George says.\n\n\n\nMarjorye Heeney is not an economist, but she definitely knows something about the Great Depression. Heeney, 83, grew up on an Oklahoma farm during the Great Depression and lived through the 1930s Dust Bowl storms. For much of that decade, \"black blizzards\" -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged the southern Plains.\n\n\n\nHeeney, who now lives in Topeka, Kansas, snorted when told that today's conditions remind some of the Great Depression. During the Depression, crops failed, and few had a job, car or clothes, she says.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone had one nail for themselves in the clothes closet,\" Henney says.\n\n\n\nHenney says the Great Depression toughened people up. People grew and canned their own food, sewed their own clothes and learned how to make possessions last.\n\n\n\n\"No one really came from wealth, and nothing was easy,\" she says. \"But people got by because they had a wonderful spirit of survival. We're not as gutsy. I don't know if we have that today.\"\n\n\n\nWhy this economic period is still frightening\n\n\n\nVictor Matheson, an economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, says the nation's most recent recession was the dot-com bust, which hit around March of 2001.\n\n\n\n\"This recession has already eclipsed the dot-com bust in every fashion,\" he says. \"During that time, the GDP did not fall much, and unemployment did not rise much.\"\n\n\n\nMatheson offers one bit of good news, though. He says today's unemployment rate is not as bad as in previous eras. The unemployment rate reached 10.8 percent during the early 1980s and 25 percent during the Great Depression, he says.\n\n\n\nYet Matheson says there is an ominous feature to the current situation: The Federal Reserve has already lowered interest rates as far as they can go, to around zero percent, but the recession marches on.\n\n\n\nThe current recession is so \"scary\" that Matheson says he has reversed his attitude on Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. He once opposed it but now supports it because he can't think of anything that might work better. He says the economy will not bounce back on its own anytime soon\n\n\n\n\"You gotta go with what you got,\" he says. \"The Federal Reserve has loosed all of its cannons, and it has nothing left. Now we're down to fiscal policy.\"\n\n\n\nNelson, the historian who has studied the panic of 1873, says today's economy might even be worse than the American economy in 1873.\n\n\n\n\"This is a perfect storm: banks failing, stock markets declining and commodity prices dropping,\" Nelson says.\n\n\n\nNelson says it took America four years to recover from the 1873 panic. Tens of thousands of workers -- many Civil War veterans -- became homeless. Thousands lined up for food and shelter in major cities. The Gilded Age, where wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few \"robber barons like John D. Rockefeller,\" followed the panic.\n\n\n\nAmerica, of course, pulled out of the panic. Nelson is just not quite sure how the nation is going to do it now. His ultimate assessment of today's economy is blunt:\n\n\n\n\"It looks grim.\"",

  "context": "Editor's note: Ted Epperly, M.D., a family physician in Boise, Idaho, is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, which represents more than 93,000 physicians and medical students nationwide. He spent 21 years in the U.S. Army, including service as a family physician, chief of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital emergency room during Desert Storm and Desert Shield, and deputy commander of an Army medical center.\n\n\n\nTed Epperly says recruiting more primary care doctors would improve access to quality health care.\n\n\n\n(CNN) --   Clayton Christensen, Jason Hwang and Vineeta Vijayaraghavan are right about one thing in their CNN commentary titled \"We don't need more doctors.\"  America's health care system is broken. It requires significant reform if patients are to have access to convenient, affordable and -- most importantly -- high-quality care that results in good outcomes.\n\n\n\nBut they have missed a central point. We need more primary care physicians now and we will need even more in the future as the baby boom generation ages.\n\n\n\nIf Americans are to see meaningful health care reform, they must have a primary care doctor to whom they can turn for everyday problems: annual physicals and preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for common illness, and diagnosis and treatment of complex, chronic conditions, referral to subspecialists, and coordination of care provided by a team of professionals.\n\n\n\nOur current system has a serious and growing shortage of these primary care physicians. Today, only 30 percent of physicians provide primary care and 70 percent subspecialize in a single organ system or disease.\n\n\n\nWe need a system in which patients get the right kind of care at the right time in the right place by the right type of provider. They need health services that provide not just convenient hours for minor health problems, but also medical expertise that ensures consistent, ongoing care; accurate diagnoses of symptoms; coordination with pharmacists, other specialists and allied health professionals such as physical therapists; consistent follow-up; and convenience. All at an affordable cost.\n\n\n\nSeveral health reform proposals set forth by President Obama and Congress would move federal policy in that direction. How? They incorporate convenience, efficiency, continuity of care and access to a system that relies on the patient-centered medical home -- a concept in which physicians coordinate care with a team of health professionals, offer evening and weekend office hours, and use electronic communication with patients and members of the health care team.\n\n\n\nBut this concept won't be fulfilled unless we have health reform that increases the number of primary care physicians. Right now, America has a current and worsening shortage of primary medical care.\n\n\n\nChristensen, Hwang and Vijayaraghavan contend that increasing the number of physicians also leads to \"greater intensity of care, but not better health outcomes.\" But their argument leaves out a major caveat.\n\n\n\nAlthough a greater number of subspecialists does increase the intensity, number and cost of services, research by Barbara Starfield at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health consistently demonstrates the opposite occurs in communities with more primary care physicians, particularly family physicians.\n\n\n\nStarfield concludes that an increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population resulted in a reduction of 34.6 deaths per 100,000 population at the state level.\n\n\n\nKatherine Baicker, professor of health economics at Harvard School of Public Health, and Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government confirm these findings. Their research shows that increasing the number of primary care physicians results in a significant increase in the quality of health care and a reduction of cost to patients. However, increasing the number of subspecialists was associated with higher costs and poorer quality.\n\n\n\nAt issue, then, is not the total number of physicians, but the number of family physicians and their primary care colleagues. Demographics, an aging population and resulting increased demand for services will require a significant increase in the number of these physicians.\n\n\n\nGiven the long-term process required to train primary care physicians, we will continue to struggle with a shortage of primary care physicians, and that shortage will affect patients' access to care. Family physicians now are working to fill some of those gaps, according to a 2008 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians. The survey found 42 percent of respondents offer extended office hours and 29 percent provide open access or same-day scheduling.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 36 percent offer Web-based health information, 32 percent (up from 10 percent two years ago) prescribe medications by e-mail, and 21 percent (up from 18 percent two years ago) offer e-mail interactions. In short, despite the financial disincentives and other barriers in the current system, family physicians are working to meet patients' needs for convenience and access.\n\n\n\nThey are improving this convenience and access with the help of nurses and nurse practitioners, who are excellent sources of care when patients have a known set of conditions and diagnoses that are amenable to treatment protocols.\n\n\n\nLikewise, walk-in clinics can fill the access gap when patients have an acute problem that requires a treatment that can be spelled out by an accepted protocol. However, even these clinics rely on an adequate number of primary care physicians.\n\n\n\nMost walk-in clinic staff realize that convenience should not trump quality or continuity, and most will refer patients to a primary care physician for follow-up and ongoing care. Again, without an adequate number of primary care physicians, these patients will have only partial access to the care they need.\n\n\n\nFamily physicians and other primary care providers are part of the solution, not part of the problem. It is important at this critical time of restructuring the health care system to understand clearly what we are trying to accomplish.\n\n\n\nWhat we are building is a high-quality, accessible health care system that increases patient satisfaction and health care outcomes while we decrease cost and ethnic disparities. This is what a primary-care based health system will deliver. This is why President Obama and Congress aim to rebuild the U.S. health care system around primary care. This is why we need more primary care physicians.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Ted Epperly.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- English contains more words than any other language on the planet and added its millionth word early Wednesday, according to the Global Language Monitor, a Web site that uses a math formula to estimate how often words are created.\n\n\n\nThe Global Language Monitor says the millionth word was added to English on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe site estimates the millionth English word, \"Web 2.0\" was added to the language Wednesday at 5:22 a.m. ET. The term refers to the second, more social generation of the Internet.\n\n\n\nThe site says more than 14 words are added to English every day, at the current rate.\n\n\n\nThe \"Million Word March,\" however, has made the man who runs this word-counting project somewhat of a pariah in the linguistic community. Some linguists say it's impossible to count the number of words in a language because languages are always changing, and because defining what counts as a word is a fruitless endeavor.\n\n\n\nPaul J.J. Payack, president and chief word analyst for the Global Language Monitor, says, however, that the million-word estimation isn't as important as the idea behind his project, which is to show that English has become a complex, global language.\n\n\n\n\"It's a people's language,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOther languages, like French, Payack said, put big walls around their vocabularies. English brings others in.\n\n\n\n\"English has the tradition of swallowing new words whole,\" he said. \"Other languages translate.\"\n\n\n\nThe Internet, global commerce and global travel have accelerated the trend by putting English in contact with many other linguistic groups. This has made English more rich and more complex -- hence all of the new terms, he said.\n\n\n\nStill, Payack says he doesn't include all new words in his count. Words must make sense in at least 60 percent of the world to be official, he said. And they must make sense to different communities of people. A new technology term that's only understood in Silicon Valley wouldn't count as a mainstream word, he said.\n\n\n\nHis computer models check billions of Web sites -- including the Global Top 5,000 media sites -- dictionaries, scholarly publications and news articles to see how frequently words are used, he said. A word must make 25,000 appearances to be deemed legitimate.  Learn about how other languages stack up \u00bb\n\n\n\nPayack said news events have also fueled the rapid expansion of English, which he said has more words than any other language. Mandarin Chinese comes in second with about 450,000 words, he said.\n\n\n\nEnglish terms like \"Obamamania,\" \"defriend,\" \"wardrobe malfunction,\" \"zombie banks,\" \"shovel ready\" and \"recessionista\" all have grown out of recent news cycles about the presidential election, economic crash, online networking or a sports event, he said. Other languages might not have developed new terms to deal with such phenomena, he said.\n\n\n\nLanguage experts who spoke with CNN said they disapprove of Payack's count, but they agree that English generally has more words than most, if not all, languages.\n\n\n\n\"This is stuff that you just can't count,\" said Jesse Sheidlower, editor at large of the Oxford English Dictionary. \"No one can count it, and to pretend that you can is totally disingenuous. It simply can't be done.\"\n\n\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has about 600,000 entries, Sheidlower said. But that by no means includes all words, he said.\n\n\n\nFor example, Sheidlower said \"great-great-great-great grandfather\" could be considered a word, but wouldn't be in the dictionary. There's a similar problem with numbers, which may be counted up by their pieces -- \"twenty\" and \"three\" -- but not always as a group, as in \"two-hundred twenty-three.\"\n\n\n\nPart of what makes determining the number of words in a language so difficult is that there are so many root words and their variants, said Sarah Thomason, president of the Linguistic Society of America and a linguistics professor at the University of Michigan.\n\n\n\nIn the language of native Alaskans, she said, there are dozens of words for snow, but many of them are linked together and wouldn't be counted individually. Does that mean, she asked, that \"slush,\" \"powder\" and other snow words in English should be counted as one entry?\n\n\n\nThomason called the million-word count a \"sexy idea\" that is \"all hype and no substance.\"\n\n\n\nLinguists and lexicographers run into further complications when trying to count words that are spelled one way but can have several meanings, said Allan Metcalf, an English professor at MacMurray College in Illinois, and an officer at the American Dialect Society.\n\n\n\n\"The word bear, b-e-a-r -- is that two words or one, for example? You have a noun that's a wild creature and then you have b-e-a-r, [which means] to bear left or to bear right, and there's many other things,\" he said. \"So you really can't be exact about a millionth word.\"\n\n\n\nPayack said he doesn't consider his to be the definitive count, just an interesting estimation based on set criteria he has helped develop.\n\n\n\n\"It's always an estimation,\" he said. \"It's like the height of Mount Everest is an estimation. The height of Mount Everest has changed five times in my lifetime because as we get better tools, the estimates get better.\"\n\n\n\nHe said the count is meant to be a celebration of English as a global language. And, while he says other languages are being stamped out by English's expansion, it's a powerful thing that so many people today are able to communicate with such a vast list of words.",

  "context": "Hamid Dabashi is the author of \"Iran: A People Interrupted.\" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/.\n\n\n\nHamid Dabashi says allegations of rape and torture are testing Iran's Islamic Republic as never before.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- Troubling news of kidnapping, rape, torture, and murder is flooding out of Iran.\n\n\n\nNeda Aqa Soltan was murdered point-blank in the streets of Tehran for the whole world to see; while Sohrab Arabi was killed far from any global attention and his body given to his mother quietly to bury, as was the tortured body of Mohsen Ruholamini.\n\n\n\nThese names have assumed symbolic significance for many more innocent young men and women murdered by the custodians of the Islamic Republic with a wanton disregard for the lives and liberties of its own citizens.\n\n\n\nNot just murder, but the rape of young men and women also is on the shameless roster of the Islamic Republic. After years of sporadic charges and troubling rumors, finally a courageous cleric has put a stamp of public recognition on atrocious practices in the theocratic state.\n\n\n\nMehdi Karrubi -- one of the revolutionary founders of the Islamic Republic, a high-ranking cleric, a presidential candidate, a former speaker of the house and now a widely popular political activist -- has published a letter, addressing it to the former president and current head of the Expediency Council Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. He accuses the security officers of the Islamic Republic of repeatedly and violently raping young women and men while they are in custody.\n\n\n\nSince the publication of this letter, a massive outpouring of testimony and reports has come out, corroborating Karrubi's charges that rapes of young women and men are a widespread, common practice in the Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\nThese are not light charges for any state, for any republic, let alone for an Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\nThese charges are no longer brought by expatriate, and at times discredited, opposition. It is the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic, with impeccable revolutionary credentials, who are bringing these charges, as others are coming out and corroborating them in excruciating detail.\n\n\n\nThe Islamic Republic has never faced such a deep crisis of legitimacy in its turbulent 30-year history.\n\n\n\nAs widely evident, it is not just the regime's claim to a \"republic\" that is in question and in jeopardy, but, perhaps far more seriously, it is its claim to Islam that has troubling consequences for more than 1.3 billion Muslims around the world.\n\n\n\nPeople in the streets of Tehran are chanting, paraphrasing a famous slogan of the 1979 revolution, \"Independence, Freedom, Iranian Republic,\" pointedly replacing \"Iranian\" for \"Islamic.\"\n\n\n\nThough this a perfectly legitimate demand, given the criminal record of the Islamic Republic, by no means is this sentiment a common denominator of the growing opposition to the regime.\n\n\n\nTo the degree that, at least in part, he represents this uprising, Mir Hossein Moussavi, as a pious and practicing Muslim, continues to insist that he wishes to restore the ideals and aspirations of the Islamic revolution within the constitution of the state.\n\n\n\nNever have the two opposing ideas of an \"Islamic Republic,\" and Muslims living in a democratic republic seemed so at odds with each other. The 30-year experience of the Islamic Republic shows fundamental flaws in defining a state apparatus in the exclusive terms of a militantly legalistic Islam, while at the same time Iranians, the overwhelming majority of them Shiite Muslims, have repeatedly demonstrated, under this regime, they are perfectly capable of democratic behavior.\n\n\n\nNot just as immigrants in the E.U. nations and the U.S., but as citizens in Iran, millions of Muslims have shown they are integral to the democratic institutions embedded in the notion of a nation-state.\n\n\n\nWhat is in question is the viability of an Islamic republic -- or for that matter, a Jewish state, a Christian empire,  a Hindu fundamentalist government -- or any state or movement that is defined not by the democratic apparatus of citizenry, but by exclusionary membership in a world religion.\n\n\n\nAs in the rest of the Muslim world, Islam is integral to Iranian society. But not exclusively so. Over the last 30 years, a radically legalistic interpretation of a cosmopolitan faith has been force-fed into a multifaceted political culture -- and today all the world can see the violent convulsion of the system.\n\n\n\nThere has been much talk of the need for an Islamic \"reformation\" over the last few years. But what Islam needs is not a Christian-style Reformation.\n\n\n\nWhat Islam needs is a restoration of its historically cosmopolitan character in which Muslims and non-Muslims live in peace and prosperity, and which they now need to retrieve in order to live in peace and prosperity in a world that is not entirely Muslim.\n\n\n\nBy virtue of living in a democracy, and having endured indignities of rampant Islamophobia in their own country, American Muslims have a historic role to play, by way of sending a delegation to Iran, connecting to this grassroots democratic movement in a Muslim nation, and helping it restore its cosmopolitan character in pursuit of enduring democratic institutions.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.",

He declined to give specific details, the news agency said.

  "context": "(CNN) -- \"Pandering.\" According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, to pander is to: \"provide gratification for others' desires.\" So is that what John McCain and Barack Obama are doing with Hispanic voters?\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain has said the issue of immigration would be a top priority for him as president.\n\n\n\nIf you follow coverage of their speeches at three Latino events -- the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the League of United Latin American Citizens and The National Council of La Raza -- the answer would be yes.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because the two candidates are talking about making immigration reform a priority if they reach the White House, and to make it there, they know the Hispanic vote can have a great impact.\n\n\n\nMore than 9 million Hispanics are expected to vote on November 4th. They traditionally favor Democrats, but many have supported Republicans in key races. In 2004, for example, 40 percent of the Latino vote went to President Bush -- so going after them makes political sense.\n\n\n\nDo Hispanics care about immigration reform? Yes, they do. But it's not the only issue that concerns them.  See where the candidates stand on immigration\n\n\n\nThey, too, pay more than $4 for a gallon of gas, and are worried about the economy, foreclosures, the war in Iraq and access to health care and education. But the debate on immigration has motivated many to apply for citizenship and many others to register to vote.\n\n\n\nHispanics aren't a monolithic group as many seem to believe. Some families go back six or seven generations. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth. Cubans can stay if they make it to U.S soil.  Latinos from all over Latin America come by plane.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, a majority of Latino voters show a deep interest in immigration reform, even though it wouldn't benefit them directly because they are U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\nThey believe reform would help in a community that shares a common language, even though it has many differences. They aren't na\u00efve and won't be swayed with tall tales.\n\n\n\nBut to pander has a negative connotation and the concept seems highlighted when it refers to Hispanics, the largest- and fastest-growing minority in the nation.\n\n\n\nThis electorate is familiar with politicians making promises they don't always keep -- and surely will see that McCain favors border security before immigration reform, a reform he put his name on at great cost.\n\n\n\nThey are aware of the need to learn English in order to succeed, and not necessarily for every child to learn Spanish as Obama suggested. That could fuel fears about Hispanic influence, and spur some to use that fear to score political points.\n\n\n\nIn this case, the approach goes in two directions. It can be seen as pandering to a specific group for political gain, but it can also be portrayed as a challenge to Hispanics.\n\n\n\nWith greater clout comes higher responsibility; it means not only registering to vote, but actually doing it on Election Day, making those numbers count, showing that Latinos are more than a group with great potential.\n\n\n\nIs pandering to Hispanics any different from pandering to other groups? Why isn't there a similar outcry when candidates address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on the future of Israel? Or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People? Isn't that pandering?\n\n\n\nHispanics are coming of political age, and probably face a dilemma. But which is better -- being pandered to, or ignored? And no, it's not a trick question.",

On Saturday, the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine's propulsion unit.\n\n\n\nNo injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. The ship's fuel tank ruptured, spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement.\n\n\n\n\"Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday, and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean's surface,\" the Navy said. \"The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel, and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures, winds and seas.\"\n\n\n\nWhen the collision occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday.\n\n\n\nChristensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship.\n\n\n\nThe Strait of Hormuz is located between the United Arab Emirates and Iran, linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf.

Thousands of families have fled the capital, Mogadishu, seeking a safer environment in camps south of the city.\n\n\n\n\"The people of Somalia have once again been subjected to unbearable violence,\" said Pascal Mauchle, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Somalia. \"The daily struggle for survival is exhausting their capacity to cope.\"\n\n\n\nHumanitarian groups expressed concern, too, that Somalis will not have access to medical care.\n\n\n\nThe international medical agency Doctors Without Borders said it was forced to close an outpatient clinic in Mogadishu to ensure safety for its staff.\n\n\n\n\"With so few medical facilities available in Somalia, it is crucial that people are able to access those that are still functioning,\" said Alfonso Laguna, head of the agency in the region.\n\n\n\nThe new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia law, or Islamic law, the spokesman said. Somalia's new President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed has recently approved implementing sharia law, but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the rebel group said it has recruited many fighters for the battle against the government.\n\n\n\n\"It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government. There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us,\" said Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for al-Shabaab.\n\n\n\nAbdiraman Abdi Shakur Warsame, minister of international cooperation for Somalia's transitional government, issued a stern warning to the rebels in an address to a young audience celebrating Somali youth day at the capital.\n\n\n\n\"The government is determined to defend itself from these religious gangs who are covering in the name of Islam and I assure you that in the course of coming days, we will eliminate these elements and some of them will be forced out of the country,\" Warsame said.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kenya released a statement about the fighting.\n\n\n\n\"The extremists who are instigating these attacks have no regard for the well-being of Somalis and are undermining the peaceful efforts of the legitimate government to further national reconciliation,\" the statement said. \"The United States is particularly disturbed at reports that foreign fighters and those who rejected dialogue in 2006 are participating in this effort to forcibly remove a legitimate Somali government from power.\"\n\n\n\nJournalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, \"Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,\" will be published in December by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama is taking a huge step in his presidency. After weeks of careful deliberation, the president has sided with military officials who have been pushing for an escalation of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplaining his objectives and exit strategy, Obama is expected to announce that he will be sending 30,000 troops, and possibly more, into the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this decision, Obama inches closer to becoming a wartime president. Even though the White House insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda, historically, presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts. The politics that surround a military operation play an enormous role in the political success or failure of an administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and many congressional Democrats realize the human and political risks that come from this war. As news broke of President Obama's decision, Pelosi said: \"the American people believe that if something is in our national security interest, we have to be able to afford it. That doesn't mean that we hold everything else\" stagnant because of those operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency. There have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Harry Truman, who served from 1945 to 1953, pulled off a historic upset in his reelection bid against Thomas Dewey in 1948. In the campaign, Truman castigated a \"do-nothing\" Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to the White House after the election, Truman fought for an ambitious domestic agenda in 1949 and 1950, which he called the Fair Deal, which included national health care, civil rights, fair housing and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a conservative coalition of southern Democrats and Republicans in Congress defeated most of his proposals, it was the Korean War, which began in the summer of 1950, that brought down his presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the military operations against North Korea bogged down into a stalemate by 1951, Republicans ripped into the administration for refusing to use enough air power against the communists.\n\n\n\n\n\nTruman, whose approval ratings plummeted to 23 percent by 1952, decided that he should not run for reelection. \"If we had been less trusting, if we had been less soft and weak, there would probably have been no war in Korea!\" Republican candidate and military hero Gen. Dwight Eisenhower said on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans focused their campaign on Korea, Communism and corruption. The Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, lost; Republicans gained control of Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson was on the verge of becoming a transformative president in the winter of 1965. Since taking office, Johnson had presided over the passage of a sweeping body of domestic measures unequaled by almost any president in American history other than Franklin Roosevelt. His accomplishments included Medicare and Medicaid, federal education assistance, civil rights and voting rights, environmental regulations, immigration reform and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet all those accomplishments seemed to disappear in the political psyche after the \"Americanization\" of the war in the spring of 1965, when Johnson authorized a vast increase of ground troops to Vietnam. By 1968, public opinion had turned against the war, with anti-war protesters organizing against \"Johnson's War.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the history books, Vietnam has swamped our memory of Johnson's presidency and eclipsed much of what he accomplished in those early years. \"That bitch of a war,\" Johnson lamented toward the end of his life, \"killed the lady I really loved -- the Great Society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recently, there was the experience of President George W. Bush. During the 2000 campaign and in the early months of his presidency, Bush pushed for a type of \"compassionate conservatism\" that sought to extend certain kinds of government programs and establish the framework for a broad Republican coalition that captured the center and right.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 extended the reach of the federal government into the nation's grade schools. After 9/11, Bush led a successful operation to knock the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan and dramatically reorganized homeland security.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut once Bush sent troops to Iraq to bring down Saddam Hussein in 2003, the war came to dominate everything else. As the reconstruction of Iraq proved to be much more difficult than the White House anticipated, Bush's popularity plummeted. In 2006, Democrats took control of Congress and in 2008 Barack Obama, on a platform defined by his opposition to Iraq, was elected president.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war. This was the certainly the case with FDR who protected many of his domestic programs and even expanded government into new areas at home as the war unfolded.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut FDR is an exception to the rule. Soon Obama will be significantly expanding an existing military operation, making this war his own. In doing so, he will be risking a huge amount of his potential impact as a president.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make matters even worse, unlike Johnson, Obama has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through Congress. While he will very likely walk away from this year with a victory on health care, most of his agenda remains bottled up.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see how Afghanistan can quickly grow in scale and scope. It would be a tragedy if a politician who headed a historic campaign based on the promise of extracting the United States from a very unpopular war would wind up bogged down in a quagmire of his own.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.",

  "context": "Tuwaitha, Iraq (CNN) -- The shell of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the Tigris River, but its radioactive legacy lingers on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tuwaitha research complex, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Baghdad, was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Tammuz 1 research reactor. It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is difficult because of the destruction,\" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. \"This facility was bombed in 1991. Now, finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility, where about 20 people are at work so far. Iraq's ministry of Science and Technology said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility, but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have 18 facilities in Tuwaitha,\" said Fuad al Musawi, Iraq's deputy science and technology minister. \"We have another 10 facilities around the country. So you can imagine how long it will take.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s, when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor. It built another, French-designed reactor in the 1970s. Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004. It accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait left it facing an international military coalition that ultimately drove out the Iraqi forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bombardment that accompanied the 1991 war inflicted extensive damage to the Tuwaitha plants. The U.N. sanctions and inspections imposed after 1991 forced Hussein's government to abandon its nuclear program, the ISG concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the 2003 invasion, which was launched after the United States incorrectly accused Iraq of having restarted its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, nearby Iraqis inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility. Villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness, particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iraq Survey Group found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings, and the U.S. military later spent $70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as \"yellowcake\" -- to Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Iraqi scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future. But for now, Iraq is still grappling with the shadow of its past.",

  "context": "BELGRADE, Montana (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday took his push for a health care overhaul to traditionally conservative Montana, saying a bill to extend coverage to the uninsured while helping those already with coverage will pass this year.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama discusses his health care plans Friday at a meeting in Belgrade, Montana.\n\n\n\nHowever, an influential Democratic representative said the House would only pass a health care bill in January or later, signaling continuing rifts within Obama's party on his domestic priority for 2009.\n\n\n\n\"We're taking some time to make sure it's done right,\" said Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania. \"I don't know that we'll get something done before January, and even then we may not get it done. We're going to do it right when it's finally done.\"\n\n\n\nObama told a largely supportive Montana audience at his second of three town hall meetings this week that fixing the health care system requires improving health insurance practices and reducing the costs of treatment. He sought questions from skeptics of his proposed health care overhaul, seeking to confront some misconceptions fueled by opponents Democrats say are undermining the debate.\n\n\n\nOne man who identified himself as a proud National Rifle Association supporter and believer in the Constitution asked how the government would pay to expand health insurance coverage to 46 million uninsured people.\n\n\n\n\"You can't tell us how you're going to pay for this,\" said the questioner, Randy Rathie, a welder from Ekalaka, Montana. \"The only way you're going to get the money is to raise our taxes. That's the only way you can do that.\"\n\n\n\nObama responded with his oft-repeated explanation that two-thirds of the cost of overhauling health care -- estimated at about $900 billion over 10 years -- would come from eliminating waste and improving efficiency in the current system, which includes the government-run Medicare and Medicaid programs for the elderly and impoverished.\n\n\n\nThe rest would have to come from new revenue, he agreed with the questioner, and he called for reducing the amount of deductions that people making more than $250,000 a year can make on their income taxes.\n\n\n\n\"If we did that alone, just that change alone ... that would raise enough to pay for health care reform,\" Obama said, noting that would meet his election campaign pledge to avoid any tax increase on people earning less than $250,000 a year.\n\n\n\nHowever, Obama said some taxes would have to be raised, and the crowd applauded when he said he believes people with more money, like himself, ought to pay a heavier burden.\n\n\n\n\"We've got to get over this notion that we can have something for nothing,\" Obama said. \"That's how we got into this deficit and this debt in the first place.\"\n\n\n\nIn reference to emotional and heated debate at some other town hall meetings across the country in recent weeks, Obama told Rathie, \"I appreciate your question, the respectful way you asked it, and by the way, I also believe in the Constitution.\"\n\n\n\nAfterward, Rathie said he was impressed by Obama's performance but remained skeptical.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think he knows where that money's going to come from,\" he said. \"If he does, he's not saying.\"\n\n\n\nObama noted there is more work to be done, with Congress seeking to merge at least four bills, along with a possible compromise agreement being negotiated by Democratic Sen. Max Baucus and five other members of his Senate Finance Committee, into a single bill in September.\n\n\n\nAnother questioner chosen when Obama asked for a skeptic identified himself as an insurance provider who wanted to know why Obama and Democrats are vilifying the insurance industry in the health care debate. Earlier in the meeting, Obama described what he called discriminatory practices by insurance companies that dropped coverage of people who became sick or refused to cover those with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n\n\nObama noted some insurance companies are contributing to the reform debate, but said others are spending millions of dollars to try to defeat any health care legislation. For a health care overhaul to work for everyone, he said, it has to ensure all Americans are covered so that insurance companies have incentive to participate.\n\n\n\nThey won't be able to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions or \"cherry pick\" healthy people while refusing coverage for sick people, Obama said, so increasing the total numbers covered will be the enticement.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Obama will hold another town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colorado, before vacationing in some national parks with his family next week. In addition, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama will hold \"some events not yet announced\" in coming days.\n\n\n\nWhile Obama has said consensus can be reached on health care reform, contentious town hall meetings held by lawmakers around the country have created a different impression.\n\n\n\nThe White House, and many Democrats in Congress, hope that by building support in the West, the president can start to turn the tide. Though the region is largely Republican, Obama made some inroads in the latest election. He won in Colorado and lost by just a slim margin in Montana.\n\n\n\nHowever, Murtha's comments in Bentleyville, Pennsylvania, to CNN affiliate WJPA signaled continuing divisions among House Democrats over the scope and pace of health care legislation.\n\n\n\n\"We said to the speaker [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi], the leadership, let's not rush this thing,\" Murtha said. \"Let's do it right, so we'll have a uniquely American plan, if the thing passes.\"\n\n\n\nObama's town hall events are just part of a larger Democratic strategy for winning support in the region.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic National Committee began a TV ad this week promoting the president's health care plan. A committee spokesman said the ad will run on national cable as well as on local cable in New Hampshire, Montana, Colorado and the District of Columbia.\n\n\n\nThe group Families USA, which supports the president's plan, also launched a campaign Thursday that includes an ad running in a dozen states -- among them Montana and Colorado.\n\n\n\nBut groups opposed to the president's plan have their own campaigns.\n\n\n\nOne voter in Livingston, Montana, not far from where the president spoke in Belgrade, summarized the kinds of concerns that she and many others in the region have.\n\n\n\n\"I believe that there is a health care crisis, I really do,\" Sonja McDonald, who voted for Obama in 2008, told CNN's Ed Henry on Thursday. \"Do I believe that the government needs to be more involved? No!\"\n\n\n\nHenry met McDonald at a clinic that gets half its funding from taxpayers.\n\n\n\n\"The government being involved is fine,\" McDonald said. \"It's just ... when they try and overstep, when they try to say, 'No, this is what needs to be done.' \"",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- More than a week after the swine flu outbreak rattled the world, with cases of infected people popping up from Mexico to South Korea, the new virus strain has shown up in a herd of swine.\n\n\n\nMasked workers push food to a sealed-off hotel in Beijing where Mexican nationals are being quarantined.\n\n\n\nThe catch, Canadian officials say, is that the animals may have caught the flu from a human.\n\n\n\nCanadian officials are quarantining pigs that tested positive for the virus -- scientifically known as 2009 H1N1 -- at an Alberta farm in what could be the first identified case of pigs infected during the recent outbreak.\n\n\n\nThey said the pigs may have been infected by a Canadian farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak that has sickened more than 680 people.\n\n\n\nThe farmer \"may have exposed swine on the farm to an influenza virus,\" said Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\n\n\n\"We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population,\" he added.  Learn about the virus \u00bb\n\n\n\nEvans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork. The number of pigs infected was not disclosed.\n\n\n\nThe infected farmer had flu-like symptoms and is recovering, Evans said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as the number of confirmed swine flu cases reached 787 worldwide, the World Health Organization said Sunday it had started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations. So far, 17 countries have confirmed cases of swine flu, the WHO said.  Watch latest developments as swine flu sweeps world \u00bb\n\n\n\nDr. Michael J. Ryan, the WHO director of its global alert and response team, said the doses of the drug Tamiflu came from a stockpile that was donated by Swiss health-care giant Roche in 2005 and 2006.\n\n\n\nRoche said it was working with the WHO to prepare for the virus. The drug should be taken within 48 hours of experiencing symptoms, according to the drug's Web site.\n\n\n\nMexico has the most confirmed swine flu cases, with 506 infected people and 16 deaths, the WHO said. Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos reported that the country has confirmed 421 cases and 19 deaths.\n\n\n\nSeveral other countries, including Canada and Italy, had confirmed additional cases that had not yet been added to the WHO's total.\n\n\n\nThe United States has the second-highest number of confirmed cases, with 160 sickened and one death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama spoke with Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday afternoon to discuss both countries' \"efforts to limit the spread of the 2009 H1N1 flu strain and the importance of close U.S.-Mexican cooperation,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\n\n\nOther than Mexico and the United States, the WHO confirmed cases in 14 other countries: Canada, with 70; the United Kingdom with 15; Spain with 13; Germany with six; New Zealand with four; Israel with three; France, with two; and Austria, China, South Korea, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Costa Rica, each have one.  See where cases have been confirmed \u00bb\n\n\n\nRyan said the WHO was still preparing for a pandemic.\n\n\n\n\"At this point we have to expect that phase six will be reached,\" he said, referring to the organization's highest pandemic threat level. \"We have to hope that it is not reached.\" And he noted that a pandemic describes \"the geographic spread of the disease, not its severity.\"\n\n\n\nThe latest developments come as parts of Asia discovered they were not immune to the spread of the virus.\n\n\n\nHundreds of guests and staff were under quarantine in China after health officials determined that a hotel guest had contracted the H1N1 virus.\n\n\n\nNearly 200 hotel guests and 100 staff members were ordered to stay in Metro Park Hotel in Hong Kong for seven days to stop the spread of the H1N1 virus, a government spokesman said.\n\n\n\nThe quarantine was ordered after a 25-year-old Mexican man stayed in the hotel and became sick, according to the spokesman. It is the first confirmed case of the virus in Hong Kong, local medical officials said.\n\n\n\nSouth Korean officials on Saturday confirmed their first case -- a 51-year-old nun who recently traveled to Mexico for volunteer work.",

  "context": "HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- President Obama misinterpreted Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro's offer to start talks with the United States, Castro's brother Fidel said Wednesday, appearing to dismiss the U.S. leader's call for Cuba to release political prisoners.\n\n\n\nFidel Castro appears with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, left, and brother Ra\u00fal Castro in a photo released in June.\n\n\n\nIn an essay published in state-run newspapers Wednesday, the ailing revolutionary leader said the people Washington calls political prisoners are \"in the service of a foreign power that threatens and blockades our homeland.\"\n\n\n\nFidel Castro's comments come after signs of a thaw in the decades-old impasse between the United States and the communist-ruled island to its south.\n\n\n\nObama lifted all restrictions on visits and money transfers between American citizens and relatives in Cuba this month, while Ra\u00fal Castro said Cuba is prepared to talk with the United States about \"everything -- human rights, freedom of the press, political prisoners.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a conference of inter-American and Caribbean leaders Sunday, Obama said the Cuban leader's declaration was \"a sign of progress.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that the Cuban government could send a much clearer, more positive signal by releasing political prisoners or reducing fees charged on remittances Americans send to relatives in the country.\n\n\n\nBut Fidel Castro wrote Wednesday, \"There is no doubt that the president misinterpreted Ra\u00fal's statements.\"\n\n\n\n\"When the president of Cuba said he was ready to discuss any topic with the U.S. president, he meant he was not afraid of addressing any issue,\" Castro wrote. \"That shows his courage and confidence on the principles of the revolution.\"\n\n\n\nHe said Cuba would be willing to release prisoners held since a 2003 crackdown on dissidents if the United States would release five Cubans convicted of spying in 2001.\n\n\n\nAnd he criticized Obama for not doing more to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba, imposed in 1962.\n\n\n\n\"Should we wait for so many years before his blockade is lifted?\" Castro asked. \"He did not invent it, but he embraced it just as much as the previous 10 U.S. presidents did.\"\n\n\n\nCastro ceded power to his brother in 2006 before undergoing surgery for a still-undisclosed intestinal condition. But he remains head of the Communist Party, and his essay raises the question of who would be calling the shots in any talks with Washington.\n\n\n\n\"Who's in charge?\" one Havana man asked Wednesday. \"Raul -- ah, Fidel -- ah, Ra\u00fal.\"\n\n\n\nBut a woman who spoke to CNN said, \"The president is Ra\u00fal. He's the one you have to listen to now.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The Southeast is among the areas of the United States with the highest concentration of cases of HIV and AIDS, according to a new online tool called the National HIV/AIDS Atlas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this map of AIDS prevalence rates in the Southeast, red represents the highest (0.593 percent or greater).\n\n\n\n\n\nAIDS experts in the region say that access to health care, especially when it comes to screening, is a major problem in rural communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Southeast, people with HIV tend to get tested late, after they have become sick, partly because of stigma, said Kathie Hiers, executive director of AIDS Alabama in Birmingham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card, the South is the worst,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith little or no public transportation, people in non-metropolitan areas are at a disadvantage when they need to see a particular kind of doctor, experts say. There is also a shortage of doctors who deal with HIV in the region, Hiers said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese problems also resonate with Georgia's rural communities, which represent 39 percent of the HIV/AIDS burden in the state, said Raphael Holloway, director of the HIV Unit at the Georgia Division of Public Health. The remaining 61 percent of people living with HIV or AIDS are in the metro Atlanta area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In some districts, for example, there may be 10 counties within that health district but only one infectious disease doctor that people can access for care and services,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also difficult to get HIV education to people in rural areas, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 29 states reporting county-level data for the National HIV/AIDS Atlas, Georgia had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of HIV and AIDS prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment, Georgia ranked fifth in reporting of new AIDS cases in 2007, behind Texas (fourth), Florida (third), New York (second) and California (first), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Northeast also has a heavy burden of HIV/AIDS cases nationally, atlas collaborators said. Other states with high numbers of counties with high HIV prevalence included Florida, New York and South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atlas, the first of its kind to map out HIV and AIDS at the level of counties, launched in time for Saturday's HIV/AIDS Testing Day. The National Institutes of Health is encouraging everyone age 13 to 64 to get tested for HIV as part of routine health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not knowing one's HIV status endangers one's health and the health of one's sexual partners. By getting tested for the virus and learning one's HIV status soon after infection, treatment can begin early, substantially delaying the development of HIV-related illness and prolonging life,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National HIV/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States. The map, a project of the National Minority Quality Forum, encompasses all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more red a region appears, the greater the prevalence, which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers can look at rates of disease by gender, race/ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available. The map also has different settings for HIV and AIDS, the more severe illness caused by the HIV virus. They can also zoom into counties and, for New York City only, ZIP codes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 33 million people have HIV/AIDS worldwide as of 2007, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC estimates that 1.1 million Americans have HIV and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the United States in 2006. Nearly 75 percent of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who worked on the atlas project were surprised at how concentrated HIV and AIDS are in certain U.S. counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the HIV epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the U.S.,\" said Patrick Sullivan, associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University, who collaborated on the atlas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atlas also reflects the disproportionate number of African-Americans who have HIV and AIDS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can see at the level of the national map that there's so much variation in the U.S. about which groups have been impacted,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographics and county-level data are not available for some states, or parts of some states, because of the way these places report data by region, researchers said. These areas appear as gray when users zoom in. Some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006, the most recent available. Collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atlas, which launched Monday morning, had about 100,000 visitors by Tuesday afternoon, and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time, said Gary Puckrein, executive director of the atlas project.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find an HIV testing facility near you, visit www.hivtest.org.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- Gay slurs hurled by three figures in professional sports in the last month are more than just testosterone-fueled temper tantrums, some say.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe behavior, they say, is symptomatic of a deeper problem and should be used as an opportunity to tackle homophobia in professional sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kobe Bryant, Joakim Noah and Roger McDowell are not any different from many people in our society who use offensive language like that on a daily basis,\" said Jarrod Chin of the Society for the Study of Sport in Society at Boston's Northeastern University. \"These incidents provide a real opportunity for the NBA and MLB to take a strong stance against homophobia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, a frustrated Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant laced a referee with an epithet that gays find offensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBryant quickly apologized and was fined $100,000. Bryant was apparently angry that the referee penalized him for a technical foul.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early May, Atlanta Braves pitching coach Roger McDowell made national headlines for tossing anti-gay slurs at a group of fans in San Francisco. He also made crude gestures at the fans, in full view of children who were in the crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a short suspension, an emotional McDowell apologized at a news conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd last week, bombastic Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah was captured by television cameras lobbing a similar slur at a fan after his second foul in the game. Noah apologized right after the game and was slapped with a $50,000 fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When sports stars use slurs, it is especially damaging because their increased public profile means many more people are exposed. These people seem to have lost sight of the fact that in their prime, in pivotal moments in games, they are one of the most influential people in the world,\" said former NBA player John Amaechi.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmaechi knows all too well about homophobia in sports. He is credited as being one of the few professional stars to admit he is gay.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Amaechi came out of the closet after he retired. He said he did not feel comfortable disclosing his orientation during his 5-year NBA stint.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmaechi says he still remembers the pointed response from NBA star Tim Hardaway that followed his disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"First of all, I wouldn't want him on my team,\" Hardaway told a radio host in 2007. \"You know, I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHardaway later apologized for his statement -- but the sentiment persists among many athletes, Amaechi says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sports stars need to remember that being a positive role model is as much a part of their job as making lay-ups, hitting home runs or scoring touchdowns,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Welts, president and CEO of the Phoenix Suns, says he had kept his sexual orientation secret throughout his long career.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelts came out when the Kobe Bryant epithet caused a stir. He said Bryant's slur solidified in his mind that he needed to go public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the irony of the timing is it was the day before that I had been sitting in David Stern, the (NBA) commissioner's office, to kind of discuss this with him. And then the next night, Kobe went off,\" Welts told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. \"You know, I think it reinforced that probably it was time, because I think that will probably be remembered as a teaching moment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile his disclosure has been received positively for the most part, Welts says is apprehensive about his future and feels that he is in uncharted territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know what my future is. I don't know where my career is going to go,\" he said. \"I think that's part of the big problem with players. There's no example out there. No one has ever done it. No one really knows what's going to happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NBA recently released a pubic service announcement featuring players Grant Hill and Jared Dudley about anti-gay language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Using gay to mean dumb or stupid... Not cool,\" Hill says in the commercial that is running during the playoff games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is offensive to gay people,\" Dudley adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some say more needs to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Male professional sports do have an issue with homophobia, but so does society in general,\" Chin, of Northeastern University, said. \"The NBA and MLB are great vehicles for educating folks about this issue and could really turn these negative events into a positive teachable moment.\"",

Daddy was going to perform last year. Thank you. We love you Daddy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince Michael and Paris, along with several cousins, wore black suits with red stripes on their pants, and red armbands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe children appeared after a rousing performance of Michael Jackson's \"Earth Song,\" with a recording of Jackson accompanied by live performances from Celine Dion, Usher, Carrie Underwood, Smokey Robinson and Jennifer Hudson.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrammy producers used the head-to-head competition between Beyonce and Taylor Swift to lure viewers to stay tuned through the three-and-a-half hour telecast.\n\n\n\n\n\nList: Major Grammy winners\n\n\n\n\n\nSwift got the biggest Grammy of the night, album of the year, for \"Fearless.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just hope that you know how much this means to me,\" she said in her acceptance speech. \"Our families are freaking out in their living rooms.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSwift also won best country album.

  "context": "(CNN) -- Milwaukee, Wisconsin, police have arrested a man whose DNA linked him to the bodies of nine women killed over 21 years, officials said at a news conference Monday night.\n\n\n\nWalter E. Ellis, 49, was arrested after police matched a DNA swab taken from him last week to the victims.\n\n\n\nWalter E. Ellis, 49, was arrested after police matched a DNA swab taken from him last week to DNA left on the bodies of nine women killed since 1986.\n\n\n\nPolice said eight of the women were prostitutes and one was a runaway involved with drugs. They were all killed within a 3-square-mile area of Milwaukee's north side.\n\n\n\n\"This case was solved with shoe leather and science,\" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn said. \"Continuing advances in DNA technology have enabled us to link these homicide cases, and it was good police work pursuing numerous leads that led to the arrest of a suspect.\"\n\n\n\nThe homicides occurred between 1986 and 2007, police said.  See where the bodies were found \u00bb\n\n\n\nEllis was charged Monday with two counts of first degree murder relating to two of the deaths: 41-year-old Joyce Mims, who was killed in 1997, and 28-year-old Ouithreaun Stokes, who was killed in April 2007. Police said more charges are likely.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether Ellis had obtained an attorney.\n\n\n\nPolice said other victims linked to Ellis through DNA were: Tanya L. Miller, killed in 1986; Deborah L. Harris, killed in 1986; Sheila Farrior, strangled in 1995; Florence McCormick, strangled in 1995; Irene Smith, killed in 1992; Carron D. Kilpatrick, killed in 1992, and Jessica Payne, killed in 1995.\n\n\n\nFlynn told CNN it was hard for investigators to discern a geographic pattern for the homicides. In the 20-year period, more than 2,000 slayings occurred in Milwaukee, he said -- 200 of them in the same area where the bodies were found.\n\n\n\nAnother challenge investigators faced was the developing technology of DNA evidence. The technology in 2009 far exceeds that available in 1986 or even 2002, he said. It was only this year that police were able to link the nine homicides with the same DNA pattern.\n\n\n\nEven then \"we did not have anyone to match our DNA profile against, until we were able to get [Ellis'] toothbrush,\" he told CNN. A Wisconsin law passed in 2000 mandated the DNA collection from convicted felons. Ellis was released from prison in 2001 without having his DNA sample collected, Flynn said.\n\n\n\nBecause his name had surfaced in the investigation and because he was also listed in two FBI databases, authorities decided to investigate him further and were able to obtain the search warrant that allowed them to collect his DNA from his toothbrush, the police chief said.\n\n\n\nNews of Ellis' arrest shocked those who knew him.\n\n\n\n\"That was just my ex-boyfriend,\" his former girlfriend, Chanita, told CNN affiliate WISN-TV. She asked that her last name not be used. \"I didn't know nothing about nothing like this. I'm getting shivery now cause you're talking about some strangling stuff. Lord have mercy on me. I'm just a wreck right now. I can't believe this. I'm trembling in here. I'm shakin'.\"\n\n\n\nChanita said she dated Ellis for four years.\n\n\n\n\"I can't believe it. This is a shock,\" she told WISN. \"I got like goose bumps on my arms instantly when you told me that. I'm like no way -- not Walter -- I can't see him hurting nobody.\"\n\n\n\nFor relatives of the victims, the news brought mixed emotions.\n\n\n\n\"I knew they was gonna get him, I knew it,\" Patricia Donald, best friend of victim Deborah Harris, told WISN. \"Finally he can't hurt nobody anymore.\"\n\n\n\nFor her and others, like Sandy Farrior, whose daughter Sheila was linked to Ellis, it was news that helped bring closure.\n\n\n\n\"Late justice is better than no justice,\" he told WISN.\n\n\n\nIn addition to advances in DNA technology, officials attributed the break in the case to the repeated investigation of cold cases by the Milwaukee Police Department's Homicide Task Force Cold Case Unit.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mims and Stokes were strangled about a decade apart, similar DNA on their bodies helped lead police to a suspect.  Watch where cops got DNA sample \u00bb\n\n\n\nMims was found strangled and lying on her back wearing only socks on June 20, 1997, in a small closet near a living room in Milwaukee, according to court documents. Police found DNA on her body, but there were no matches in the system, the court documents show.\n\n\n\nOn April 27, 2007, Stokes was found strangled, partially clothed and lying face down in a living room in Milwaukee, according to court documents. When lab technicians tested the DNA found on her body, they found it directly matched the DNA found on Mims.\n\n\n\nOn August 29 of this year, armed with a search warrant, police took a toothbrush and razor from Ellis' home. Testing showed the DNA found on Mims and Stokes was a match to Ellis, according to court documents.\n\n\n\nEllis has been charged at least 10 times with varying offenses ranging from violent crimes to property crimes between 1981 and 1998, though some of the charges were dismissed, online court records in Wisconsin show.\n\n\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in state prison after he pleaded no contest to a reckless injury charge in 1998.\n\n\n\nNone of the victims linked to Ellis was killed during the time he was in jail. However, two men were charged in slayings later linked to Ellis, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\n\nCurtis McCoy was charged in October 1994 with killing Kilpatrick, but he was later acquitted by a jury, the newspaper reported. It also said Chaunte Ott, who was convicted of killing Payne, served 13 years in prison before being released in January, after DNA analysis showed semen found on the girl's body was not his.\n\n\n\nCNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.",

Even if he is a great champion, I have never had admiration for him and I never will,\" the 26-year-old Spaniard admitted.\n\n\n\n\"It was a delicate situation, very tense, the two riders who had most weight on the team did not have an easy relationship and that puts the rest of the technical staff and the riders in an uncomfortable position,\" he added.\n\n\n\nThe Spaniard, who also won the Tour in 2007, compared the situation with that of Formula One drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton at McLaren when they were colleagues.\n\n\n\n\"That situation in some way illustrated what I have experienced. But I knew that if we kept a cool head everything would be OK,\" he added.\n\n\n\nWith Armstrong and Astana team chief Johan Bruyneel both leaving the team at the end of the season, Contador's future also remains unclear. \"We will have to see what happens. I do not know where I'll go, but I am clear that it will be a team that is 100 per cent behind me.\"\n\n\n\nContador eventually finished the race over four minutes clear of Luxembourg's Andy Schleck, with American Armstrong -- who was riding in his first Tour since completing the last of his seven wins in 2005 -- a remarkable third.\n\n\n\nIt was Contador's fourth successive grand tour victory, after he also won last year's Giro d'Italia and Vuelta Espana following the Tour organizers' decision not to invite the Astana team to the race.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- No play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball. And no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not just robots they send out there,\" umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet these figures -- the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment -- are vastly different in importance to the average fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are countless children who dream of becoming a major-league pitcher. He is, literally, the king of the hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires? Almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet the positions share a number of similarities, according to two new books: \"As They See 'Em\" (Scribner), by New York Times writer Bruce Weber, and \"The Complete Game\" (Knopf), by former major-league pitcher (and current New York Mets broadcaster) Ron Darling.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth jobs require a great deal of command, neither gets enough training, and both are often disrespected by others in the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers (Jim Bouton's \"Ball Four,\" Jim Brosnan's \"The Long Season,\" Christy Mathewson's \"Pitching in a Pinch\"), Darling said he believes that people still don't understand what it takes to stand on that mound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'If pitchers weren't so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' \" he said in an e-mail. \"Of course, I knew this was a fallacy so I decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers. Throwing a ball 95 mph to tin cup-sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me, and I wanted to express this to the reader.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human. (\"The owners basically see them like bases,\" former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent told Weber. \"They say, 'We need a base; we need an umpire; same thing.' \") Weber found a fraternity (and they are almost all men) much like cops or soldiers: tight-lipped believers in baseball law and order.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeber immersed himself in the \"land of umpires,\" as the book's subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary Doug Harvey, who was called \"God\" for his imperious demeanor. What he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field, a matter not just of eyesight but positioning, rule-book knowledge and basic guts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's really what [being an umpire] is about -- is being in charge,\" he said. \"If there's anything that characterizes the major league umpire, it's that special kind of chutzpah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men. Aside from the vitriol they face -- the managers kicking dirt, the spectators yelling \"Kill the ump\" -- they're second-guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management, as Weber reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the 1999 umpires' strike.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes. (MLB does run an annual umpire camp.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDarling echoes Weber's concerns in his own field, pitching. In these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are \"undertrain[ed],\" he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks \"never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches.\" That leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning, he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles,\" he says. \"Identifying and preserving million-dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDarling's book is a chronicle of pitchers' thought processes, using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point. He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he remembered the games vividly. \"I definitely watched tapes and read box scores, but I was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days. A little scary and maybe a major personality flaw!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPitchers get more support than umpires, of course. Darling observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well-pitched game \"is one of sport's most beautiful dances. I would not have said it when I was playing, but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process. You did something together that could not have been done alone, and nobody can understand what you went through to get there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires, too, take pride in their best moments, though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires. More common is to be vilified for missed calls. Weber devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired Don Denkinger, a 29-year veteran remembered by fans (if he's remembered at all) for a wrong call in the 1985 World Series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough time has dulled the pain, \"I think he lives with [that call] every day,\" Weber said. \"When a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it, it must be devastating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks. When watching games now, the Yankees fan says, he'll focus on the umpires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just think umpiring is interesting. People hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but I don't,\" he said. \"Now I'm always interested who the umpires are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is a point the umpires would appreciate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Umpires are people, too,\" veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber. \"We have families; we have emotions. ... Somebody says, 'Kill the umpire,' and people go, 'Heh, heh, that's funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're human. We're not just robots they send out there.\"",

  "context": "Bountiful, Utah (CNN) -- It was two weeks after D-Day, a few miles from the bloody shores of Omaha Beach. An airstrip had been carved out of the Normandy countryside, costing the lives of 28 Army engineers at the hands of German snipers.\n\n\n\nA lone sniper still remained in the nighttime distance.\n\n\n\nDespite the risk, Capt. Jack Tueller felt compelled to play his trumpet.\n\n\n\nThat afternoon, his P-47 fighter group had caught up with a retreating German Panzer division. As the U.S. Thunderbolts descended on their targets, they saw French women and children on top of the tanks. After an initial fly-by, the order was given to attack anyway.\n\n\n\n\"We were told those human shields were expendable,\" Tueller said.\n\n\n\nBack at the airstrip, Tueller took out his trumpet. He'd used it on many a starlit night to entertain the men of the 508th Squadron 404th Fighter Group.\n\n\n\n\"I was told, 'Captain, don't play tonight; your trumpet makes the most glorious sound,' but I was stressed,\" he said. He was so troubled that he was willing to take a chance the sniper wouldn't fire.\n\n\n\n\"I thought to myself, that German sniper is as lonely and scared as I am. How can I stop him from firing? So I played that German's love song, 'Lilly Marlene,' made famous in the late '30s by Marlene Dietrich, the famous German actress. And I wailed that trumpet over those apple orchards of Normandy, and he didn't fire.\"\n\n\n\nThe next morning, the military police came up to Tueller and told him they had a German prisoner on the beach who kept asking, \"Who played that trumpet last night?\"\n\n\n\n\"I grabbed my trumpet and went down to the beach. There was a 19-year-old German, scared and lonesome. He was dressed like a French peasant to cloak his role as a sniper. And, crying, he said, 'I couldn't fire because I thought of my fianc\u00e9. I thought of my mother and father,' and he says, 'My role is finished.'\n\n\n\n\"He stuck out his hand, and I shook the hand of the enemy,\" Tueller said. \"[But] he was no enemy, because music had soothed the savage beast.\"\n\n\n\n\"Boy, you have strong lips\"\n\n\n\nTueller had learned to play the trumpet as a child growing up in Wyoming. His mother, a nurse, died at 29, and his father, a bartender and alcoholic, left the next day -- leaving Jack and his brother, Bob, orphans.\n\n\n\nThey left their home in Superior to live with an aunt in nearby Evanston. She gave Jack his first trumpet, and he quickly discovered he had a musical ear.\n\n\n\n\"In 1939, I was playing in Yellowstone Park in a dance band of 22 musicians at Lake Hotel. The famous trumpet player Louis Armstrong came up to the band during intermission and said, 'You sound pretty good for white cats,' \" Tueller recalled.\n\n\n\nHe asked Armstrong what advice he would give a young trumpet player. \"He said, 'Always play the melody, man. Look at them, see their age group, play their love songs, and you'll carry all the money to the bank.' \"\n\n\n\nTueller enrolled at Brigham Young University, where he met his future wife and fellow trumpeter, Marjorie.\n\n\n\n\"This beautiful brown-haired gal with luscious lips said, 'Did you play the trumpet solo at the freshman assembly?' And I said, 'Yes, ma'am, I did.' She said, 'Boy, you have strong lips.' Being a sophomore, I said, 'Would you like to try me?' She nodded, and I went over and kissed her.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1941, as war clouds gathered, Jack enlisted in the Army and was sent to fighter school because he was an \"individualist,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to fly it, fire it, navigate it, shoot the guns.\"\n\n\n\nHe once flew his plane through a dirigible hangar at Moffitt Field in Sunnyvale, California. The commandant was fuming mad.\n\n\n\n\"He stood me in a brace, then he kind of smiled and says, 'We don't want to quell spirit like that ... but don't do it again!'\"\n\n\n\nWhen D-Day arrived on June 6, 1944, Tueller was in the air, flying five missions.\n\n\n\n\"I witnessed the invasion from a ringside seat. We saw 2 million men, 10,000 ships. And we just shot at everything,\" he said. \"We tried to help those men trying to get off the landing craft at high tide, where a lot of them were drowned.\n\n\n\n\"I remember feeling pride and sadness as I saw the bodies of 4,000 killed in two hours.\"\n\n\n\nTueller credits common sense and his first flight instructor, a crop duster, with his survival that day -- and the rest of the war.\n\n\n\n\"I learned to love low-level flying. I never came off enemy targets high. I'd lay it down a row of trees 400 knots, a foot off the ground, so all the flak would go over my head. They'd wonder where I'd gone.\"\n\n\n\nTrumpet in the cockpit\n\n\n\nTueller managed to fly 140 missions without taking a single bullet hole to his airplane -- the name of his infant daughter, Rosanne, painted on the side.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone wanted to fly it; they thought it let a charmed life.\"\n\n\n\nAnd on each mission, Tueller carried his trumpet in the cockpit.\n\n\n\n\"I took it in a little canvas bag attached to my parachute. I figured if I ever got shot down, it would go with me, and if I survived and got put into a prisoner of war camp, I could get an extra bar of soap from the guard.\"\n\n\n\nHis tour of duty ended just before his fighter group left for Belgium and the Battle of the Bulge. Three months later, his plane was shot down and destroyed. The pilot was killed.\n\n\n\nTueller went on to fight in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and served in the Pentagon during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War. He retired in 1966 as a colonel, having earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, almost two dozen air medals and two Legions of Merit, the nation's highest peacetime award.\n\n\n\nNow 89, Tueller takes care of Marjorie, his wife of 68 years, who has Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\nAs Veterans Day approaches, he has a word of advice to veterans: \"When you become a veteran, it's my opinion that you should do everything to make people realize the wonderful life that you really have.\"\n\n\n\nHe still has his trumpet of 70 years and still performs at schools, family get-togethers and church functions. He has a stereo system installed in the back of his family van, where he inserts a CD of big band music and begins playing the melodies of a bygone era.\n\n\n\n\"I was an unruly child,\" he said. \"Music tamed me. ... My ambition as the last action on my part as a veteran is to hit high C and fall right into the grave. What a way to go!\"",

Eric Eggen.  Watch a report from Lt. Eggen \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe 180-foot processing trawler was about 120 miles west of Dutch Harbor, in the remote Aleutian Islands, when the crew reported being \"overwhelmed by water\" and abandoned ship, Eggen said.\n\n\n\nMost of the crew had survival suits to protect them from water that was near-freezing, said Cmdr. Todd Trimpert, a Coast Guard spokesman. No cause of death was immediately known for the four crew members who died, but \"certainly, they were in the water a long time,\" Trimpert said.\n\n\n\n\"Without a survival suit, generally your survival time is less than 30 minutes,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe company that owned the ship, The Fishing Company of Alaska Inc., identified the four who did not survive as Captain Eric Peter Jacobsen, Chief Engineer Daniel Cook, Mate David Silveira and Crewman Byron Carrillo.\n\n\n\n\"They were incredibly brave, hard-working men,\" the company said. \"Our hearts are broken.\"\n\n\n\nA nearby ship, the Alaska Warrior, rescued 25 crew members while the Coast Guard retrieved the rest of the crew, the company said.\n\n\n\n\"We do not have sufficient information to determine why the vessel foundered,\" the company said. \"We will do everything possible to find out what occurred with the hope that something can be learned that will be of value to the fishing community.\"\n\n\n\nAmy Roman, a niece of Daniel Cook, told CNN affiliate KING-TV that her uncle \"died how he wanted to.\n\n\n\n\"If you're a fisherman, you want to die out at sea,\" she said. \"If you're a true fisherman, this is how you want to go.\"\n\n\n\nSurvivors were being taken aboard the Coast Guard cutter Munro. A helicopter and a C-130 transport plane were also taking part in the effort, the Coast Guard reported.\n\n\n\nThe sinking left an unknown amount of diesel fuel on the surface of the Bering Sea, Lane said.\n\n\n\nThe fishing industry is perennially among the most deadly in the United States. In 2005, 48 fishermen died, up from 38 the year before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That made it the nation's most dangerous occupation for the year, with a fatality rate of 118.4 per 100,000 -- nearly 30 times higher than the rate of the average worker. E-mail to a friend",

  "context": "(CNN) -- In an effort to alleviate problems facing the company, Starbucks announced that it will close 600 company-run U.S. stores over the next year. Most of the stores are near another Starbucks and aren't profitable.\n\n\n\nNancy Blomquist moved from Georgia to Arizona and sent friends this photo of her first 'houseguest' -- Starbucks.\n\n\n\nCNN.com asked iReporters to respond to the news that the coffee giant, known for its saturation of the market, is shuttering some retail locations.\n\n\n\niReporter mattwilliams says he's happy to see some Starbucks go, opening the market for independent coffee shops. Rusty1978 says he can't imagine how Starbucks is in financial trouble, given that his local store is always packed. Cval predicts more people will give up their lattes as the economy tightens.\n\n\n\nBelow are a selection of iReport responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Starbucks here\n\n\n\nStefan: Starbucks Coffee, no doubt, has been a powerhouse phenomenon in the American barista world. The coffee super-giant has not only introduced, but set a national trend in coffee drinking for years to come ... they have created a culture.\n\n\n\nEverywhere you look, from street corners, to bookstores and now even supermarkets, there is a Starbucks coffee shop or stand. So what will we do if we no longer have our daily dose of super-charged joe? Go somewhere else.\n\n\n\nSince they started becoming a national chain, there has been a rush of smaller coffee shops trying to duplicate the relaxing, welcoming feel of Starbucks, and some do well and even exceed the patron's expectations, offering sofa's, tables, background music and even free internet.\n\n\n\nBut what about the coffee? As for those specialty drinks, many small coffee shop owners have started sending their employees to barista school, where they learn how to make the \"perfect\" cup of coffee / espresso with those perfect little beans. ... It is possible we may see a new coffee shop in town; and maybe, just maybe, the \"next big thing\".\n\n\n\nFlashBauer38: I am glad to see Starbucks finally realized you only need one store per city block. I personally do not like or go to Starbucks. I normally get my coffee from Dunkin Donuts on the way to work or buy grounds from them to make at home ... for a reasonable price. I already have to spend $4 a gallon on gas, why would I spend $4 for 12 oz of coffee?\n\n\n\ncval: You're kidding me, right? Anyone heard of the Mr. Coffee machine? You can get one for $15, and set it to have your coffee ready for you when you roll out of bed, then it turns off an hour later so as not to burn your house down should you forget to turn it off. Starbucks has always been a luxury item, when people need to get back to basics to survive.\n\n\n\nMaybe people are just realizing this, and it is way overdue if you ask me. It's as expensive as smoking, think of all the money you can put into savings if you brew your own coffee.\n\n\n\nJohnmcook: \"My Starbucks\", in the Uptown section of West Village is much more than a place to get a cup of java. It is a real part of the community, a busy, urban, somewhat trendy area near downtown Dallas.\n\n\n\nI know each employee by name and they know me. I keep track of their progress through college, another's budding music career, and will attend another's wedding. When on the patio with my Chihuahua, they bring him water to help beat the heat or whipped cream as a treat ...\n\n\n\nIf you have ever spent time in the UK... you understand the social importance of meeting at the local pub... my Starbucks is the equivalent of that. You come there to get your favorite coffee but you leave with and come back for ... so much more.\n\n\n\nrusty1978: Well, amongst all the Starbucks frowners around, I must say it's strong coffee and that's how I like it. I've got a Starbucks in commercial space in my building -- so convenient. I love the Verona, Gold Coast and Kenya blends.\n\n\n\nI just can't believe they're not doing good business as most every store is always packed with people -- and they've even raised their prices last year, so I can't understand the closings at all. Someone please explain. Yes, I prefer strong Starbucks coffee in the morning!\n\n\n\nmattwilliams: Could I live without Starbucks? The answer is a resounding YES! I live in a small tourist town on the coast of Georgia. Our many different local restaurants provide unique dining experiences with their atmospheres and menus. This is something I fear is being lost because of big chains like Starbucks coming in and replacing local, unique businesses with the same atmosphere and dining experience one could have in Anytown, USA.\n\n\n\nSo rather than make every little getaway town in this country the very same one Starbucks at a time, I say boycott them all and shut them all down! That won't happen because Starbucks has become part of a routine for so many people.\n\n\n\nWhat would be nice is for the average American consumer to wake up and try to have a unique experience in his or her hometown. Rather than going to that same Starbucks that is so convenient with its drive-thru and perfect location on the way to one's destination, why not take a detour and find a mom-and-pop coffee shoppe, like our own Palm Coast Coffee or Daddy Cate's, and support their brave attempt at making the landscape of where one lives unique.\n\n\n\nNblomq: Definitely a Starbucks Junkie! I moved from Georgia to Arizona last fall, and the first digital picture I sent my girlfriends once I arrived in Tucson was a picture of my first official visitor to my new home ... a Starbucks Chai!\n\n\n\ngrdpxjmpr: I absolutely could live without Starbucks.\n\n\n\nReason 1: I don't like the taste of Starbucks coffee, especially since they had their closure back in February to make their coffee shop more like a coffee shop. The coffee they have started using since then is terrible.\n\n\n\n2. If the Starbucks chain would close some stores, it would allow mom-and-pop-type places to get a footing in the market or allow local smaller chains to expand.\n\n\n\n3. Buying beans for home and making your own coffee is substantially less expensive than getting coffee every day from Starbucks. In this economy, being able to pinch pennies helps.\n\n\n\nMrRealtor: I hate to say this, but I just like a good ole cup of coffee, and that cannot be found at a Starbucks. Even their most mild coffee is terribly bitter. Will I miss them? No. I would miss a 99-cent cup of coffee from 7-11 worse than a $4.50 cup of yuck from Starbucks.\n\n\n\nBlueken: In my entire life, I have had exactly one coffee from Starbucks. Nothing special. I'm not a coffee snob, of course, but I do like a pure Kona roast. I get my caffeine fix at the local gas station. Fresh brewed, $1.49. I predict overpriced microbrew beer is the next to take a hit as the economy gets real.\n\n\n\nIchDenke: Yep, Starbucks is too pricey, too burnt and too mega for me! Gimme a hometown-y joint that ain't too expensive and supports our veterans like Just Plain Joe's, and I'm OK! :)",

  "context": "BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chinese leaders Monday mourned the death of Zhuo Lin, wife of former national leader Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\n\nZhuo Lin, center, mourns at husband Deng Xiaoping's funeral in 1997.\n\n\n\nZhuo, a former consultant of the Central Military Commission General Office, died July 29 at age 93 and was cremated Monday, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\n\n\n\nShe was \"an excellent Communist Party of China member and time-honored loyal communist fighter,\" the party said in a written statement.\n\n\n\nZhuo stood by Deng through decades of what CNN once described as \"amazing comebacks\" from \"political purges.\" Though a committed Communist revolutionary, Deng also was a chief architect of some key reforms that reshaped China's economy.\n\n\n\nZhuo met Deng in 1939 when they were young revolutionaries. She became his third wife and mother of his two sons and three daughters. When Deng rose to prominence as the most powerful leader of China, the family became China's \"first family.\"\n\n\n\nZhuo and Deng remained together until his death in 1997.\n\n\n\nPart of their story includes time spent together in exile.\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Deng proposed major reforms including free markets for farmers and incentive bonuses. He was quickly denounced as a \"capitalist roader,\" a Maoist term used for people embracing capitalist ideals.\n\n\n\nHe was under house arrest for two years, paraded in a dunce cap through the streets of Beijing and forced to wait tables at a Communist Party school.\n\n\n\nIn 1969, Deng, Zhuo and several of their children were exiled to Jiangxi province in southeastern China. Deng later said only a personal security team supplied by Chinese leader Mao Zedong protected him from being killed.\n\n\n\nAs Xinhua reported, Zhuo was Deng's companion \"through thick and thin.\"\n\n\n\nWhen he ascended to power in 1978, Deng argued that \"poverty is not socialism\" and encouraged the creation of a market economy and capitalist-like enterprises. By the early 1990s his reforms had helped lift an estimated 170 million peasants out of extreme poverty.\n\n\n\nBut he refused to abolish the power of the Communist Party over the lives of China's citizens. And he apparently approved the brutal suppression of unarmed demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.\n\n\n\nThe remarkable ups and downs of Deng Xiaoping's long political career took a dramatic toll on Deng and Zhuo's children, CNN reported in 1999, \"leaving one son crippled from an attack during the Cultural Revolution but, in more recent years, enabling all five Deng heirs to succeed in business, government or the arts.\"\n\n\n\nThe Cultural Revolution was initiated by Mao in 1966 to purge reformists and return the country to his style of communism.\n\n\n\nZhuo took on various roles in the Chinese government. In 1978, she was appointed a consultant of the Central Military Commission General Office, Xinhua reported.\n\n\n\n\"She served as a deputy to the fourth and fifth National People's Congress and was awarded the Independence Merit Medal from the People's Liberation Army in 1988,\" the news agency said.\n\n\n\n\"My father and mother did not just share a family, they shared political ideals and life pursuits,\" said Deng Rong, in a Xinhua report.\n\n\n\nAccording to Xinhua, several leaders and former statesmen attended Zhuo's cremation ceremony, including President Hu Jintao, former President Jiang Zemin, legislator Wu Bangguo and Premier Wen Jiabao.\n\n\n\n\"To complete the last trip with her beloved husband, Zhuo chose to have her ashes scattered at sea as her husband's were,\" Xinhua reported.",

  "context": "MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The head of a leading Russian human rights group accused the presidents of Russia and Chechnya of complicity in murdering their top activist in Chechnya.\n\n\n\nNatalya Estemirova, pictured in 2007, had been openly critical of Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\n\n\n\"I am confident about who killed Natalya Estemirova. We all know this person. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov, President of the Chechen republic,\" Oleg Orlov, the chairman of the Russian human rights group Memorial said on the group's Web site Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"Ramzan was intimidating and insulting Natalya, and considered her his personal enemy. We don't know whether it was him personally who ordered her [murder] or it were his aides who wanted to please their boss. As far as [Russian] President [Dmitry] Medvedev is concerned, it seems that he doesn't mind having a murderer as head of one of the Russian regions.\"\n\n\n\nEstemirova, 50, was kidnapped outside her home in Chechnya Wednesday, Orlov said, citing eyewitnesses, and found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia later the same day.\n\n\n\nHer body was riddled with bullets, Russian prosecutors said -- several shots to the abdomen, and one to the head.\n\n\n\nThe winner of three international human rights awards, she was a leading activist in the North Caucasus area who had been openly critical of Kadyrov and his methods.\n\n\n\nKadyrov vowed Thursday that he would personally oversee the investigation and assure her killers were punished.\n\n\n\n\"She couldn't have had enemies among reasonable people,\" he said in a statement on the Chechen government Web site. \"Those who took away her life have no right to be called humans, they don't deserve any mercy, and should be punished as the most cruel criminals.\n\n\n\n\"I have no doubts whatsoever that those who ordered and conducted this crime will face trial,\" he said. \"That is the very least that the government and society must do in commemoration of Estemirova.\"\n\n\n\nMedvedev said Thursday the murder was \"a very sad event,\" adding it was \"absolutely clear... her murder is linked to her professional activities.\n\n\n\n\"Her type of professional activity is needed by any normal state. She did very useful things. She spoke the truth. She openly, sometimes harshly assessed some types of processes that occurred in our country, and this is the value of human rights workers, even if they are not comfortable,\" Medvedev said Thursday on a visit to Germany.\n\n\n\nHis host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, warned the killing could affect Russian-German relations.\n\n\n\n\"This is an unacceptable event, and especially if we want to intensify the relations between our two countries, it cannot remain unsolved,\" she said in a joint appearance with Medvedev.\n\n\n\nMedvedev had earlier condemned the murder and said her killers should punished to the full extent of the law, his office said.\n\n\n\nEstemirova shouted that she was being kidnapped, as she was forced into a white Lada automobile that had stopped on the road in front of her house on Wednesday morning, Orlov said.\n\n\n\nAn unidentified man grabbed her and shoved her into the car, Orlov told CNN.\n\n\n\nEstemirova had spent years investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya, the restive Russian republic where Russian forces have fought two conflicts against separatists since 1991. Russia officially ended its military mission in Chechnya in April of this year.\n\n\n\nThe activist told CNN in 2007 she was investigating dozens of abductions and murders that had become the norm in Chechnya, where security forces were fighting a dirty war against separatist rebels.\n\n\n\nShe joins a growing list of journalists and activists killed after criticizing the Russian authorities, many of whose murders remain officially unsolved.\n\n\n\nTop United States and European officials condemned the murder of Estemirova and demanded that the killers be brought to justice.\n\n\n\n\"Such a heinous crime sends a chilling signal to Russian civil society and the international community and illustrates the tragic deterioration of security and the rule of law in the North Caucasus over the last several months,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"How many more Natalya Estemirovas and Anna Politkovskayas must be killed before the Russian authorities protect people who stand up for the human rights of Russian citizens?\" Council of Europe Secretary General Terry Davis demanded, referring to the Russian investigative journalist who was killed in 2006.\n\n\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in a written statement that Estemirova had \"uncovered massive, ongoing human rights violations in Chechnya by the federal and regional authorities.\"\n\n\n\n\"The killers of this courageous reporter, one of the few left in Chechnya, must not be allowed to walk free like so many before them,\" CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney said.\n\n\n\nShe won three international awards for human rights activities -- including the inaugural Anna Politkovskaya Award, named for the murdered journalist with whom she often worked.\n\n\n\nEstemirova was Politkovskaya's \"most frequent companion during travel and investigations in Chechnya,\" the organization Reach All Women in War said in announcing the prize for Estemirova. \"They investigated a number of cases together -- about which Anna wrote for (the newspaper) Novaya Gazeta and Natalya wrote for Memorial's Web site and for local newspapers.\"\n\n\n\nEstemirova studied history at Grozny University, then taught history before turning to journalism and human rights in 1998, Memorial said.\n\n\n\nShe joined the organization in March 2000.\n\n\n\nCNN's Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance, Maxim Tkachenko and Mike Sefanov in Moscow, Russia, contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Editor's Note: Reese Witherspoon, the Academy Award-winning actress, is honorary chairman of the Avon Foundation and is employed by Avon Products as its global ambassador.\n\n\n\nReese Witherspoon says she wants to banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- Every three minutes in the United States, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\n\nAs a woman, a mother, and a daughter, I find that statistic terrifying. I was never na\u00efve about breast cancer, but hearing this statistic put it all into perspective.   Women close to me have battled the disease and are now soldiers in the greater fight against it. But the moment I heard \"every three minutes,\" I felt vulnerable and scared as I realized that anyone is susceptible.\n\n\n\nThe only way for me to ease my fears was to take action. I needed to educate myself and others on this disease. As the Honorary Chair for the Avon Foundation, I had resources at my fingertips. I had access to an entire organization that is dedicated to giving back to women and educating people. So I started asking, \"What do I need to know?\"\n\n\n\nIt was through that curiosity that I found out the most important fact in breast cancer: Early detection saves lives.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Avon Foundation Breast Cancer Crusade, there is a 97 percent five-year survival rate when breast cancer is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body. When breast cancer first develops, there are usually no symptoms, which is why women need to perform self-exams regularly and contact their doctor upon noticing even the smallest change.\n\n\n\nOf course talking about breast cancer and breast health is a personal thing. I too am a private person but encourage all women to break through their reservations and talk to their doctors and physicians.\n\n\n\nWe must also banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer. At the Avon Walk in Washington, I met young survivors who were diagnosed in their 20s, an age when most women are graduating from college and just starting their lives as full adults.  Watch Reese and Larry at the Avon Walk \u00bb\n\n\n\nWomen in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam by a health professional at least once every three years and women 40 and older should have an exam every year.\n\n\n\nI am passionate about fighting this devastating disease. I fight for my mother, myself, my children and future generations of women, so one day we will not have to be afraid of breast cancer. I began my fight by learning important first steps in breast cancer detection, and will not end my fight until every woman can stand together saying we are breast cancer free.\n\n\n\nMore than anything else, I have faith -- faith we will find a cure. I saw this commitment in the faces of the women in Washington -- in the faces of the women walking and the women and men who stood on the sidelines encouraging the 3,500 participants to the finish line. I was cheering right along with them, screaming for action to find a cure.  Avon's next walk will take place in New York City on October 4 and 5.",

  "context": "London, England (CNN) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic finally took the stand Monday at the U.N.'s international tribunal at The Hague to defend himself against genocide charges stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor CNN's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, the 64 year-old was as defiant and unrepentant as the man he recalled meeting outside Sarajevo in 1993-94, as Bosnian-Serb forces shelled the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaradzic, who faces 11 charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide during the war, told the tribunal the Serb cause is \"just and holy,\" and dismissed as myths two of the worst atrocities of a conflict that claimed 100,000 lives -- the three-year siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre in 1995.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe even claimed that the image of the Muslims as victims was untrue and that they were the first to attack. Their fighters \"had blood up to their shoulders,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I will defend that nation of ours and their cause that is just and holy,\" he said in his defiant opening statement. The aim of the \"Muslim plotters,\" he added, was \"100 percent power, as it was in the Ottoman Empire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is reminiscent of those days,\" said Robertson, who reported from the Bosnian capital during the war. \"These were the exact same justifications: 'we're the ones that had been under attack, we're the ones being wronged.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very telling that he's not trying to address specific issues, such as the Srebrenica massacre and such like, which are going to be the main parts of the prosecution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many Bosnian-Serbs watching this will feel that he's doing the right thing because Serbs have a history of feeling wrongly done to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said some still think back to their nationalist past and only identify with themselves through that, which is incompatible with the direction modern Europe is taking. \"They're trying to return to a kind of Serb nationalist heyday, which is akin to the Taliban taking Muslims, if you will, back centuries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKaradzic is the most senior figure to stand trial since the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, who died of a heart attack in 2006 before a verdict was reached.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Robertson, the trial might offer a crumb of comfort to some victims but it will stir up a great deal of emotion and anger to many Bosnian-Muslims who lost relatives or their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you listen to Karadzic's description of the situation in Bosnia during this period it belies the fact that Bosnian-Serbs went through and ethnically-cleansed people from their towns,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were towns and villages where no Muslims were left. Any towns or villages the Serbs couldn't get into they just surrounded and poured on machine-gun fire and rockets. This trial is going to bring all this out again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted 44 months, Karadzic was in Pale, a mountain-top village to the south-west of the capital which became the Bosnian-Serb headquarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nDown below, Sarajevo was like a goldfish bowl surrounded on all sides by Bosnian-Serb soldiers who had dug in and were shooting civilians indiscriminately with machine guns, sniper rifles and mortars. \"These were men in uniform with weapons taken from the former Yugoslav national army acting on clear instructions,\" said Robertson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's hard to get an idea of what a siege is like in modern Europe. But imagine a city where you can't leave, get out to buy eggs, apples or fuel for your car. Equally nothing can come in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The encirclement of Sarajevo was so tight that the only way in or out for Bosnians was a hand-built tunnel they dug under the U.N.-run airport runway. A man couldn't stand upright in the tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Telephone lines were non-existent, while electricity and water supplies were often cut for weeks on end.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn one occasion, while buying fuel in Serb-held territory, Robertson came across several Bosnian-Serb snipers at a gas station. They proceeded to show him their positions and what they could see through their rifle scopes. \"Looking down onto the streets you could see why the snipers were so effective,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the conflict Bosnian-Serb forces were supported by the rump Yugoslav state -- which would later become Serbia -- and its national army, which was dominated by Serb generals. \"That chain of reporting command was important,\" said Robertson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember going to Belgrade with Karadzic and he was the like the vassal of Milosevic. He was going there worried about what demarche he was going to get from him. So there was a complete tie-in between the Bosnian-Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But in terms of the chain of command on the ground, I don't think anyone there would question the fact Karadzic and his political allies gave the backing, justification and instruction for the army to act on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For three years you can't surround Sarajevo and shell it as a political leader. He never once stood up and tried to stop what was going on and only condoned and supported it, having meetings with army commanders involved, such as Mladic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRatko Mladic is the most senior fugitive still at large.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that Karadzic's tribunal has finally resumed after a four-month postponement, many analysts believe it has enough evidence to secure a conviction. \"If there's a successful conviction,\" said Robertson,\" then the court should feel it has set a good marker for future leaders who would try to turn guns on civilians and try to divide a country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Failure would call into the question the tribunal's ability to try anyone.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A tip from a television viewer led to the arrest of a Florida man accused of killing four of his family members on Thanksgiving Day, authorities said early Sunday.\n\n\n\nPaul M. Merhige is accused of fatally shooting his twin sisters, a 6-year-old cousin and a 79-year-old aunt at a family home in Jupiter, Florida, on November 26. One of his sisters was pregnant.\n\n\n\nAuthorities say Merhige also wounded two other family members.\n\n\n\nA viewer of \"America's Most Wanted\" recognized descriptions of Merhige and his car, authorities said at a news conference early Sunday. Officers immediately responded to the tip late Saturday, surrounding a small motel in the Middle Keys, part of the Florida Keys.\n\n\n\nMerhige, who had apparently been at the Monroe County motel since December 2, did not resist apprehension by U.S. marshals, authorities said. It was not immediately clear whether he was armed when marshals burst into his motel room, more than 200 miles from Jupiter.\n\n\n\nMerhige made a first appearance in a West Palm Beach, Florida, court later Sunday morning in a hearing that lasted only minutes, according to CNN affiliate WPTV. He is charged with four counts of premeditated murder and attempted first-degree murder.\n\n\n\nAsked by the judge if he had anything to say, Merhige declined comment, WPTV said. His next court appearance is scheduled for February 1. He will be held without bond at the Palm Beach County jail.\n\n\n\nJim Sitton, father of 6-year-old Makayla, who was killed, told CNN affiliate WPTV late Saturday that he would \"sleep a little better tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\"I won't be patrolling my house with a shotgun, looking for the monster. ... I've been in protective mode,\" he said. \"This doesn't bring Makayla back. I'm not jumping for joy. Her room is still empty. But the monster is in a cage now.\"\n\n\n\nThe \"America's Most Wanted\" tipster told authorities that Merhige had checked into the Edgewater Lodge motel under the name John Baca and provided an address in Homestead, Florida, according to a news release from police in Jupiter, Florida.\n\n\n\nNo one at the motel was immediately available for comment, but its Web site included photos of waterfront rooms, efficiencies and townhouses starting at $89 a night.\n\n\n\nMerhige had paid cash at least two weeks in advance, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release. He was on a computer when marshals burst into his second-story room.\n\n\n\nMerhige had tried to disguise his 2007 Blue Toyota Camry with a car cover and had switched its vehicle tag with one from another car he'd owned, the statement said. He also had shaved his head in an attempt to disguise his identity, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said.\n\n\n\nLast month, the marshals added Merhige to their list of the Top 15 most-wanted fugitives. A total of $100,000 was offered as a reward for information leading to Merhige's arrest, the sheriff's office said, and the tipster may be entitled to it.\n\n\n\nThe agency also released some distinguishing characteristics about Merhige, saying he was known to either fake or display symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, such as frequent bathing and shaving, and difficulty making decisions. He also had faked or displayed symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, and taken several prescription drugs for the ailments, the agency said.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A potentially deadly new strain of the swine flu virus cropped up in more places in the United States and Mexico on Saturday, in what the World Health Organization called \"a public health emergency of international concern.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen wearing masks wait at a health clinic Saturday in Mexico City.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent reports Saturday afternoon were of two confirmed cases of the virus in Kansas -- bringing the number of confirmed U.S. cases to 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose joined nine confirmed cases in Texas and California and an apparent outbreak at a private school in New York City, where officials say eight children likely have the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Saturday night, health officials in Mexico said 81 deaths there were \"likely linked\" to the swine flu.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jose A. Cordova Villalobos, Mexico's Secretary of Health, said viral testing has confirmed 20 cases of swine flu across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Felipe Calderon on Saturday issued an executive decree detailing emergency powers of the Ministry of Health, according to the president's office.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order gives the ministry with the authority to isolate sick patients, inspect travelers' luggage and their vehicles and conduct house inspections, the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government also has the authority to prevent public gatherings, shut down public venues and regulate air, sea and overland travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO's Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any time that there is a virus which changes ... it means perhaps the immunities the human body has built up to dealing with influenza might not be adjusted well enough to dealing with this new virus,\" Hartl told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Mexico, otherwise young and healthy people have been hit by the virus -- \"one of the pieces of the puzzle that is worrying us,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico City has closed all of its schools and universities because of the virus, and the country's National Health Council said all Saturday's soccer games would be played without public audiences.

Watch for more on the U.S. cases \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 1,300 people with flu-like symptoms have been admitted to hospitals in Mexico, and officials are trying to determine how many of those patients have swine flu, the country's health minister, Cordova said.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. health officials said Friday that some cases of the virus matched samples of the deadly Mexican virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, New York's Bureau of Communicable Diseases said preliminary tests from a Queens school suggest that eight out of the nine children tested probably have the swine flu virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Don Weiss said up to 200 students at the school reported feeling ill.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the samples will be sent to the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, to determine the subtype of the strain. The results could be known as early as Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's concerning about this is, first, that it's likely swine flu; second is that at this time it is spreading from person to person,\" said New York City health Commissioner Thomas Frieden. Watch news conference with NYC health department spokesman \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the flu spreads person to person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it a tougher strain that is harder to treat or fight off.

Neither of them was hospitalized, said Dr. Jason Eberhart-Phillips, director of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States had not issued any travel warnings or quarantines by Saturday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Public Health Agency had issued a travel health notice, saying, \"The Public Health Agency of Canada is tracking clusters of severe respiratory illness with deaths in Mexico.\"  Watch CBC report on Canadian microbiologists' concerns \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms of swine flu include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesser advised people with flu-like symptoms to stay home from work or school and to see a doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Mayra Cuevas, Ann Curley, Caleb Hellerman, Elaine Quijano and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.",

  "context": "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Steroid test results and notes and calendars from his then-trainer are among the evidence federal prosecutors have amassed in their perjury case against baseball home-run king Barry Bonds, according to documents unsealed Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBarry Bonds, shown at his most recent court appearance, is accused of lying to a grand jury.\n\n\n\nThe 223-page stack of documents unsealed by a federal judge represents much of the government's case against Bonds, who is accused of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury investigating the use of steroids in professional sports. Prosecutors say the test results show Bonds was using performance-enhancing substances -- including a then-undetectable designer drug -- at a time he denied knowingly using any.\n\n\n\nBonds' attorneys are seeking to keep much of that evidence out of court. The 44-year-old former San Francisco Giants slugger holds Major League Baseball's single-season and all-time home-run titles, but his achievements have been shadowed by allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\n\nBonds pleaded not guilty to the perjury and obstruction of justice charges and has been free on $500,000 bond. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe charges stem from his 2003 appearance before a federal grand jury probing the distribution of steroids by the San Francisco-area Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative, or BALCO. Bonds told the grand jury that his former personal trainer, Greg Anderson, gave him a cream that he said was flaxseed oil to use on his arm in 2003.\n\n\n\nAnderson spent three months in prison after admitting distributing steroids and was later jailed for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors. The case against Bonds will include calendars kept by Anderson that prosecutors say were used to keep Bonds and other athletes on a doping regimen -- an assertion expected to be bolstered by the testimony of other athletes, they said.\n\n\n\nEvidence will include a recording of a phone conversation with an associate in which Anderson \"describes injecting the defendant, having the ability to obtain and utilize inside information about MLB's random drug testing to the defendant's benefit and the undetectable nature of what Anderson had been doing,\" according to documents.\n\n\n\nBonds won seven National League MVP titles during his 22-year career, 15 years of which was spent with the Giants. The team released him after the 2007 season, just weeks after he broke Hank Aaron's career home-run record.",

  "context": "(Rolling Stone) -- Saturday night, Buffalo Springfield will wrap up their seven-date reunion tour with a headlining slot at Bonnaroo. According to the group's singer and guitarist Richie Furay, fans who missed out on seeing them this time around will have plenty of chances later in the year. \"The plan is to do 30 dates this fall,\" he tells Rolling Stone. \"The anchors will be Los Angeles and New York. What the other cities are, I can't tell you right now -- but we're almost certainly doing Red Rocks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan is to play mostly large theaters, as opposed to arenas and amphitheaters. \"We want to keep it a little more intimate,\" he says. \"Rather than going out and playing a huge something . . . There have been people from Florida, Chicago and Texas saying to me, 'Hey, you gonna come my way?' I have to say that with 30 shows, we're gonna hit those cities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Rolling Stone's Cover: The Sheepdogs vs. Lelia Broussard. Vote Now\n\n\n\n\n\nFuray became a born-again Christian in the mid-1970s, and since 1983 he's worked as a pastor at Calvary Chapel Church in Broomfield, Colorado. \"The church has been very supportive of this tour,\" he says. \"I have an assistant pastor that's doing some of the Sundays and we have a guest speaker come in too. Everybody's taken care of.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHours before taking the stage with Buffalo Springfield at the Santa Barbara Bowl tonight, Furay called into Rolling Stone to chat about the tour.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's start at the beginning. Where were you and what you were doing when Neil Young first contacted you last year about a Buffalo Springfield reunion?\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I was probably just in my home studio office, probably working on some church stuff. This thing was not on my radar. I got one of those calls that Neil was calling me, so I got on the phone and we just started the conversation. He said that he'd been talking to Stephen [Stills] and they thought it would be really fun to do the Bridge School Benefit. They wanted to know if I was into it. It's kind of funny, 'cause Neil said, 'Well, you know, we don't have to do it this year if this is too soon. We can do it next year or the next year...\" And I'm thinking, \"Neil, I mean we're not 20 years old again. We better do this while we still can!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI think a day later we all got on the phone -- Stephen, Neil and myself. We all agreed to do it. I was on my way to Israel in a couple of weeks, so right after I came back I had four days and then I went out to Northern California. We just kind of started rehearsing and it led to this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffalo Springfield Launch First Tour In 43 Years\n\n\n\n\n\nHow long after the two Bridge School shows did you start talking about doing more shows this year?\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas of last year it was decided. I don't know how it all got done. The three of us and our managers just kind of agreed to go ahead and take it to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\nI imagine that Bonnaroo was the anchor for these six California shows this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely. They all build up to it. It started in Oakland, which is a little obscure and out of the way. Then we went to Los Angeles and there was a little more tension and publicly visible. Now here we are at a smaller outdoor venue. It's given us a feel building up to being outdoors at Bonnaroo.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos: Buffalo Springfield Kick Off Their Reunion Tour\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many days did you guys rehearse?\n\n\n\n\n\nA solid week. It was to our advantage that we had played in October, so we had at least an hour's worth of music that we'd already started to rehearse. And then we just moved on from there. One of the neat things about what we're doing is that we're doing it ourselves. We don't have 10 musicians and singers. We got five guys and what you hear is what you get. I think that is something really unique for what we're doing right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you singing songs you haven't sung since in over 40 years?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, yeah! With the Richie Furay Band I do a medley of songs that I sang on the first Buffalo Springfield album. I do a medley of \"Flying On the Ground Is Wrong,\" \"Do I Have To Come Right Out and Say It and Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing.\" I also play a version of \"Go and Say Goodbye\" because I just love that song. So with those four songs I was already familiar, but everything else was pretty much songs we haven't played for 40 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you feel when you're walking onstage with Neil and Stephen? This is something nobody thought would ever happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's awe. That's what everybody is feeling. I saw a guy this morning that said he was coming to the show tonight. He said, \"I had tickets 43 years ago in Nashville to see you guys with the Beach Boys.\" It was within a day or two of when Martin Luther King had been shot and we'd cancelled the show. He said, \"So I've been waiting 43 years to see this band play.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm so used to seeing Neil as the frontman. It's cool to see him sing harmonies or just play the piano. He usually isn't a utility player like that.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeil made it clear at the first show -- and certainly this was our understanding going in -- that this was not Neil Young and Buffalo Springfield or Stephen Stills and Buffalo Springfield. This is Buffalo Springfield. That's the approach we're taking. It's a band and everybody fills their role. [Drummer] Joe [Vitale] and [bassist] Rick [Rosas] fill their roles too. We just share the music and the lead singing. It's a true band.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no agendas. That's what's really neat. I think we're way past that. I mean, we were 20-year-old kids when we started. We're doing this because we want to do it and it's fun and it's unique and because we know there's a lot of people out there that, like me, that never thought it would ever happen!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has to be the most time the three of you have spent together since 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are you guys getting along? Is it weird after all this time?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, there's nothing weird about it. From the moment I saw Neil at the rehearsal hall before the Bridge School we just started talking. There was nothing we had to work through or work out to get our relationship back together. None at all. Then when Stephen arrived it was the same thing. This has been a truly dynamic situation. Everybody is just feeling the same. We left the show last night and Stephen just had the biggest smile on his face. That's just the way it is.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is the fun we thought we were going to have back in the Sixties. Because of circumstances, it just didn't happen. But we're having fun now. There's energy in Neil. There's energy in Stephen. There's energy in me. I feel young up there, man.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you at all nervous about playing Bonnaroo in front of something like 80,000 people?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not. You know, sometimes it's more difficult to play in front of 80 people than it is 80,000. It's just the way it is. With the nerves of intimacy it can be much more intimidating than playing in front of a sea of people.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of the reviewers have commented on how remarkably preserved your voice is. Do you attribute that to good genes or clean living or just luck?\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that's the grace of God. No doubt about it. But I think I'm singing better than I did in 1967. There's more of a confidence there now.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you guys thinking about taping the shows for a live album or DVD?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, there's been no direct conversation that I've had, but I know the shows are being recorded. Each one.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think the setlist is going to change at all? I know fans want to hear \"Expecting To Fly,\" \"Flying On the Ground Is Wrong\" and a few others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's certainly not going to change before Bonnaroo, but I would say that by the time we go out in the fall we will probably work in five or six more songs. We'll probably work in \"Flying on the Ground is Wrong,\" \"Hung Upside Down\" and \"Down to the Wire.\" We were just going over the chord patterns to that one yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure it's hard to say at this point, but do you think that Buffalo Springfield is going to carry on in some form after this tour?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I don't think you're gonna be able to say that Buffalo Springfield is an entity that you can count on continuing. I mean, there might be some special things that we do -- but right now it's just one day at a time. We all have different careers, and this is what we're doing right now . . . What's most heartwarming to me is the friendships. I mean, it's just too much, man.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- NATO and Russia have agreed to restart their military relationship, nearly a year after it had been frozen over the war in Georgia, the top NATO official said on Saturday.\n\n\n\nRussia's conflict with Georgia in August 2008 strained relations between NATO and Russia.\n\n\n\n\"The NATO-Russia Council is up and running again also at the political level,\" said NATO Secretary- General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, speaking at a meeting of ministers in Corfu, Greece.\n\n\n\nRussia is not a member of NATO but is a member of the NATO-Russia Council, formed in 2002.

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The rules governing air traffic over New York's Hudson River need to be rewritten to prevent another mishap like this month's fatal collision of a small plane and a sightseeing helicopter, federal safety investigators said Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe wreckage of a plane that collided with a helicopter is lifted this month from the Hudson River.\n\n\n\nThe recommendation comes three weeks after nine people were killed when the two aircraft collided in the congested airspace bordering Manhattan.\n\n\n\nThe recommendation is noteworthy both because of its sweeping nature and its timing. Ordinarily, the National Transportation Safety Board makes recommendations at the conclusion of its investigation, which typically take a year.\n\n\n\nBut in a letter to FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt, NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said that based on preliminary findings, the safety board is concerned about the \"safety of flight\" over the Hudson River. She outlined a series of changes, among them requiring that helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft fly at different altitudes over the river.\n\n\n\nShe made specific reference to \"the performance of air traffic controllers\" at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, who were monitoring the plane's flight during the August 8 collision.\n\n\n\n\"The NTSB is concerned with the complacency and inattention to duty evidenced by the actions of the [Teterboro] controller and the supervisor during the events surrounding this accident,\" Hersman wrote.\n\n\n\nHersman said the pilot of the aircraft requested permission to climb to 3,500 feet minutes before the crash. But because there was no coordination between controllers at Teterboro and Newark airports, controllers did not grant the request, increasing the risk of a collision in Hudson River low-altitude airspace known as the \"exclusionary zone,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPilots in the exclusionary zone are not separated by air traffic controllers, and instead use visual \"see and avoid\" tactics. The Teterboro controller was making a personal phone call and \"was not fully engaged in his duties\" in the minutes leading up to the accident, Hersman said. His supervisor, meanwhile, had left the building on a personal errand without informing the controller.\n\n\n\nThe air traffic controller's inappropriate phone call \"likely would not have been permitted\" if the supervisor had been in the tower, Hersman said.\n\n\n\nThe FAA on Thursday did not comment on the NTSB recommendation, but said a task force studying flight operations above the Hudson River will soon submit its findings. And the air traffic controllers union defended its member, saying he had handed off the plane's pilot to another radar tower before the helicopter appeared on his radar scope.\n\n\n\n\"The NTSB again has rushed to wrongly blame the air traffic controller in this incident,\" said Patrick Forrey, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. \"The bottom line here is that the controller is not responsible for contributing to this tragic accident. ... We cannot provide traffic advisories to aircraft we are not talking to, cannot see on radar or are not a factor at all.\"\n\n\n\nForrey said the NTSB \"inexplicably\" made its recommendations before the FAA task force had finished its job. \"The task force is due to release its report next week. So why the rush?\" Forrey said.\n\n\n\nIn its letter, the NTSB asks the FAA to establish a special flight rules area, or SFRA, for the class B exclusion areas near New York City; require vertical separation between helicopters and airplanes in these SFRAs; require pilots to complete specific training on the SFRA requirements before flight within the area; and conduct a review of other airspace configurations where specific pilot training and familiarization would improve safety.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- An estimated one percent of adults have active epilepsy, and many of them are getting insufficient treatment, according to a 19-state survey released Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"This is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states,\" said Rosemarie Kobau, lead author of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, in a telephone interview. \"What we learned is that, among adults with active epilepsy, more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their epilepsy, and that's really unacceptable.\"\n\n\n\nA follow-up survey is planned to determine why so many people with seizure disorders said they had not seen a specialist in the past year, Kobau said.\n\n\n\n\"This is a highly specialized field,\" said Eric Hargis, the president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation, which collaborated with the authors of the study. \"It's not possible to get state-of-the-art care\" for the disorder from primary care doctors.\n\n\n\nOne in six (16.1 percent) adults with active epilepsy with recent seizures said they were not taking their medication and two-thirds (65.1 percent) said they had had more than one seizure during the prior month.\n\n\n\nMore than a fifth (20.4 percent) said cost was a barrier to seeking care from their doctor.\n\n\n\nAccess to high-quality care is key to quality of life, Kobau said. People with recurrent seizures face substantial impairments in their daily activities; many are not allowed to drive and, as a result, depend on public transportation. In some areas, particularly rural ones, that can present a barrier to full participation in life, she said.\n\n\n\nThat's not all. In addition to carrying stigma, people with epilepsy were more likely to live in households with the lowest annual incomes and to report being unemployed and unable to work.\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2005 findings, 1.65 percent of the population said they had been told by a doctor that they had epilepsy or a seizure disorder, the report said. Half of that group (0.84 percent) said they had active epilepsy -- defined as having had one or more seizures during the prior three months or currently taking medication.\n\n\n\nIf the findings translate to the general population, that means a stadium filled with 60,000 people would contain 480 people with active epilepsy, Kobau noted, adding, \"Epilepsy is not rare.\"\n\n\n\nBut that view was disputed by Dr. James King, a family physician in Selmer, Tennessee, and president of the American Association of Family Physicians.\n\n\n\n\"There are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"In my own personal practice, I'd say that I can manage at least half, if not more, of the patients that have seizure disorder.\"\n\n\n\nMany of the others are able to get by with just a one-time visit to a neurologist, said King, whose practice is 50 miles from the nearest neurologist, and 100 miles from the nearest neurologist who accepts Medicaid, the government program for the poor.\n\n\n\n\"There's only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the neurologist.\" He said financial barriers -- from insurance to the cost of anti-seizure medication -- are a bigger problem.\n\n\n\n\"If you can't afford to buy it -- which is what I run into with a lot of the seizure medicine -- it doesn't really matter\" if patients see a neurologist or a family physician, he said.\n\n\n\nMany patients, forced to choose between paying their light bill or taking their anti-seizure medication, choose the former, King said.\n\n\n\nEpilepsy is a condition in which the normal activity of the brain malfunctions, causing recurrent seizures -- electrical storms in the brain -- that can be characterized by a range of symptoms, including sudden change in awareness, movement or sensation.\n\n\n\nEach year, about 200,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease, as was Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after he suffered a seizure last year at his Maine vacation home.\n\n\n\n\"Many people with epilepsy do lead normal, productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder,\" Kobau said.\n\n\n\nThe study, conducted by the federal government and published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, estimates that 2.7 million people in the United States have epilepsy, and that it costs some $15.5 billion in medical care and lost or reduced earnings or productivity each year.\n\n\n\nHargis said the incidence of the disorder is expected to climb among veterans returning from Iraq or Afghanistan, where head injuries are common. \"When you have a head injury, it's common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period -- it could be a couple of months or it could be years,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAnd the aging population is also expected to boost the incidence of epilepsy. Conditions of aging, such as stroke and Alzheimer's Disease, are also associated with a higher incidence of epilepsy.\n\n\n\nThe study was based on data from more than 120,000 adults in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.",

It was way overloaded, completely unsafe,\" said Capt. Jim Fitton, the Coast Guard's sector commander in Miami, Florida. \"With smugglers, you have the potential for this because smugglers aren't interested in people's welfare. They're interested in making money.\"\n\n\n\nThe boat capsized about 15 miles east of Boynton Beach, Florida, some time around 2 a.m. Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. The agency was notified more than nine hours later by someone who saw the boat.\n\n\n\nThere were women and children on the boat, Fitton said. A pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, while most of the victims remained onboard a Coast Guard cutter that was being used in the continuing rescue efforts, he said.\n\n\n\nOnly eight of the people rescued by Wednesday afternoon were wearing life jackets.\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Luke Harrigan, a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, pastor to members of the Haitian community who is working with the Coast Guard, said he is contacting family members of the victims who were killed.\n\n\n\n\"Most of them now didn't even know they were coming to the United States,\" he said. \"Sometimes the person organizing the trip doesn't even tell them where they are going.\"\n\n\n\nHe said it's not uncommon for smugglers to charge people from the impoverished island nation as much as $4,000 for passage into the United States.\n\n\n\nCoast Guard rescuers were continuing to search the area of the crash Wednesday evening.",

  "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It's the middle of the night and Steven Ford is wide awake.\n\n\n\nInsomniac Steven Ford says he needs to find a better way to wind down after a long day on the job.\n\n\n\n\"I toss and turn and watch the clock, sometimes at 3 in the morning, 2 in the morning,\" lamented Ford, 44, a commercial sign installer in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\nValerie McCloskey, a 42-year-old mother of two from Grand Rapids, Michigan, complained of a similar problem. \"My husband is sound asleep next to me and I'm thinking about everything that I'm worried about.\"\n\n\n\nMcCloskey and Ford are among a huge group of Americans who suffer from some type of insomnia.\n\n\n\n\"Sleep problems are very, very common,\" explained Dr. David Schulman, director of the Sleep Laboratory at Emory University in Atlanta. \"They affect more than a third of Americans in a given year.\"  Health Minute: Watch more on sleep disorders \u00bb\n\n\n\nSleep problems may be common, but Schulman stressed that insomnia is not normal if it lasts more than a month or two.\n\n\n\nHe said most adults need about eight hours of sleep a night. In reality \"the average American sleeps just under seven hours,\" he said. \"That's a problem.\"\n\n\n\nA persistent lack of sleep or poor quality sleep can leave you feeling exhausted when you wake up.\n\n\n\n\"These folks are walking zombies,\" Schulman said. \"They are out there with four or five hours of sleep a night.\"\n\n\n\nLong-term sleep problems also may exacerbate other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, experts say.\n\n\n\nBefore you can treat the problem, you probably need to figure out what kind of insomnia you're dealing with.\n\n\n\nThe condition is classified as primary or secondary. The latter means that a patient may be having trouble sleeping because of a health condition or medication.\n\n\n\nPrimary insomnia is not related to any side effects. It is considered its own disorder that can be broken down into two groups: sleep-onset insomnia and sleep-maintenance insomnia.\n\n\n\nLike its name, the sleep-onset version occurs in the beginning of the night when someone tries to fall asleep and can't.\n\n\n\n\"Sleep-maintenance insomnia is much less common,\" Schulman said. \"It occurs when somebody can go to sleep, but wakes up once or several times throughout the night and has difficulty resuming sleep.\"\n\n\n\nStress, anxiety and depression may be some of the causes of chronic insomnia.\n\n\n\nBefore he prescribes medications, Schulman typically suggests that his patients try a number of things to regain control of their sleep cycle.\n\n\n\nFirst, he said, don't stay in bed for longer than 20 to 30 minutes if you can't fall asleep or fall back asleep.\n\n\n\n\"If you accustom your body to being in bed for hours at a time unable to fall asleep, that behavior to some degree becomes subconsciously ingrained,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAvoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. Studies show that \"if you take caffeine at noon it's still in your system at 8 or 10 at night,\" Schulman said.\n\n\n\nDon't eat or exercise within three hours of bedtime. Schulman said both detract from sleep.\n\n\n\nHe also suggested avoiding alcohol before bedtime because it might trigger a lighter sleep and make it more likely you'll wake up in the middle of the night.\n\n\n\nFinally, he recommended finding light, relaxing activities that will induce sleep, such as reading or listening to soft music.\n\n\n\nHe cautioned insomniacs to avoid bright light before bedtime. He also warned against watching television and using video games and computers before turning out the lights.\n\n\n\nCooling off might help. \"One of the ways you can fool your body into thinking it is cooling off is to heat it up just before bedtime,\" Schulman said. \"Take a warm bath or shower 30 to 45 minutes before going to sleep. As your body cools off afterwards, it is very sleep-inducing.\"\n\n\n\nSteven Ford admitted he needs to find a better way to wind down after a long day on the job.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't consider his problem to be serious enough yet to see a doctor, adding \"I'm too manly to try to look for help. I just deal with it, go to work and wait for the weekend.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The suspect accused of killing a minister at an Illinois church had marked the day of the attack as a \"day of death\" or \"death day\" in a planning book, a prosecutor said Tuesday.\n\nTerry J. Sedlacek, shown in a family photo, has been charged with first-degree murder.\n\nThere were \"words to those effect,\" written in a day planner belonging to Terry J. Sedlacek, the man accused in Sunday's attack at the First Baptist Church in Maryville, Illinois, said William Mudge, the Madison County state's attorney.\n\nMudge said he hadn't seen the planner and could not recall the exact wording that police described to him. He said police found the book in Sedlacek's home.\n\nLt. Scott Compton of the Illinois State Police said he hadn't seen the planner and could not confirm Mudge's account.\n\nAuthorities have charged Sedlacek, 27, with first-degree murder in the killing of the Rev. Fred Winters. He also was charged with two counts of aggravated battery related to the stabbing of church members Terry Bullard and Keith Melton.\n\nSedlacek was seriously wounded in the melee, authorities said.\n\nMelton, one of the two church members stabbed in the attack, described the scene that erupted during Sunday service.\n\nWinters had been preaching for a while when the gunman approached him, Melton told CNN.\n\n\"It just seemed a lot out of place for someone to be walking to the front to take a seat at that point in the service,\" Melton said.  Watch Melton say they're \"still very stunned\" \u00bb\n\nWinters stopped his sermon and asked the man what he could do for him, Melton said.\n\nThe assailant fired a weapon and hit the pastor's Bible, causing \"confetti\" to fly into the air, Melton recalled.\n\n\"It was a bit confusing just at first,\" Melton said, adding that he could see from the pastor's reaction that what happened was not part of the service.  Watch the aftermath of the church shooting \u00bb\n\nMelton was one of two men who first jumped the assailant, he said.\n\n\"By the time the second shot rang out, there were a number of us who sprang into action,\" Melton said.\n\nWinters jumped off the stage, Melton said, and was met by the gunman. The two wrestled and more shots rang out.\n\nThe attacker's .45-caliber weapon jammed at that point, authorities said.\n\nThe assailant tried to get away but was subdued by church members, some of whom blocked the entrances while others grappled with the gunman.\n\n\"There were men everywhere,\" Melton said.\n\nIt was minutes before Melton realized he had been stabbed, he said, attributing the delay to adrenaline.\n\nHe was treated and released from a local hospital. Bullard, another church member, also was stabbed in the attempt to subdue the gunman.\n\nSedlacek is being treated at a hospital after suffering serious knife wounds.\n\n\"When he was tackled by two of the members, we don't know whether he fell on the knife, injuring himself at the time, or whether [his injury] was self-inflicted during the struggle,\" said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent.  Watch police describe the church members' \"heroic action\" \u00bb\n\nTrent said police are trying to determine a motive, noting that church members did not recognize the gunman.\n\nIn August, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch profiled Sedlacek in an article on Lyme disease, and quoted his mother, Ruth Abernathy, as saying he began acting strangely during his junior year in high school. He seemed confused and stopped participating in activities that had interested him, she told the newspaper. She said a doctor had diagnosed Sedlacek as mentally ill before a battery of tests revealed that he had Lyme disease, according to the paper.\n\nThe newspaper reported that even years later, Sedlacek, then 26, had lesions on his brain and was taking several medications, including an anti-seizure drug.\n\nThe Post-Dispatch identified him as a resident of Troy, Illinois, in suburban St. Louis.\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that mental illness associated with Lyme disease is highly unusual, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America said Lyme disease \"is not known to cause violent behavior.\"\n\nBut a study published in 2002 in the American Journal of Psychiatry and carried out in the Czech Republic found that 36 percent of 900 psychiatric subjects had antibodies to the bacterium linked to Lyme disease, versus 18 percent of 900 healthy control subjects.\n\nThe Illinois shooting is believed to be the nation's first in a church since July, when a 58-year-old man opened fire in a Knoxville, Tennessee, church during a children's play. Two people were killed and six wounded in the shooting at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church.  See a U.S. map of other recent church shootings \u00bb\n\nJim Adkisson pleaded guilty last month in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty with a sentence of life in prison without parole, court officials said.\n\nCNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.",

  "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was inevitable that a tragedy on the scale of Hillsborough, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal with Nottingham Forest, would have a transformative effect on English football.\n\nA Liverpool supporter Wednesday, outside Anfield. Ninety-six fans died from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.\n\nBut there was little reason to believe 20 years ago that, rather than being pushed even further towards the margins of society, the sport was on the brink of a revolution that would give birth to a global sporting phenomenon.\n\nEven before Hillsborough, it had seemed as if there was something irredeemably rotten at the heart of English football.\n\nHooliganism, a scourge synonymous with the English game, had receded from its peak in the 1970s but English clubs were outlawed from European competition after rampaging Liverpool fans caused a wall to collapse at Brussels' Heysel Stadium before the 1985 European Cup final, causing the deaths of 39 people, mostly supporters of the Italian side Juventus.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, showing little understanding or patience for the traditions of the sport, had virtually ghettoized fans, promoting a scheme to have each supporter issued with an identity card.\n\nOn the field, sides such as Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest were renowned for their attractive play but elsewhere a corrosive cult of long ball football pervaded the game.\n\nThat trend seemed to find vindication when arch-exponents Wimbledon, who in the course of a decade had bullied and scrapped their way through four divisions to reach the top flight, defeated Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final, prompting match commentator John Motson to declare that \"the Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club.\"\n\nWith its clubs banned from Europe, many top British players opted to leave England altogether -- Gary Lineker and Mark Hughes to Barcelona, Glenn Hoddle to Monaco, Chris Waddle to Marseille -- adding further to the sense of terminal malaise.\n\nHillsborough had not been caused by hooliganism but the tragedy was a product of the environment that hooliganism had created; stadiums resembling decrepit fortresses, the fans caged inside steel bars and heavy-handed policing which treated all supporters equally -- as potential troublemakers.\n\nCoupled with Heysel and a fire at Bradford in 1985 in which 56 fans died, it also served to reinforce the belief that going to a football match was something which could put your life in danger.\n\nIn \"The Last Game: Love, Death and Football,\" a book examining the lasting impact of the events of 1989 on the sport, author Jason Cowley describes Hillsborough as English football's \"psychological moment, the point of no return.\"\n\n\"The culture of the game had to change definitely if football was ever to be perceived as anything more than the preserve of the white, working class male, a theatre of hate and of violence, often racist and misogynistic excesses, if it was to survive at all,\" says Cowley.\n\nEnglish football not only survived but within a few years had reinvented itself, in the elite \"Premier League\" division of the country's top clubs at least, as an internationally recognized super brand capable of attracting the world's best players and broadcast around the planet.\n\nThe engine for this transformation, in the wake of Hillsborough, was the Taylor Report, an inquiry into the causes of the disaster which called for the steel fences inside grounds to be dismantled and for the phasing out of the traditional terraces of standing fans with all-seater stadiums.\n\nInitially clubs received government funding to help them meet the costs but the sport was about to receive an injection of cash that would radically change its financial prospects.\n\nDespite its poor reputation, there remained a huge appetite for televised football -- ironically, itself a by-product of the fact that many supporters were no longer going to matches.\n\nRealizing this, the country's top clubs broke away from the game's traditional power structure, setting up the Premier League and selling TV rights for \u00a3191 million ($286 million) to media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's newly established satellite television venture, BSkyB.\n\nThe money was a shot in the arm for football, while Sky's coverage regenerated interest in the sport by repackaging it as something shiny, exotic and exciting. On a Europe-wide scale, the replacement of the old knockout format European Cup with the Champions League achieved something similar, creating a clique of continential superpowers.\n\nThe television rights boom also convinced many in the sport that football could actually be profitable. Some clubs raised more cash by floating on stock markets and others, such as Bolton, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, invested in shiny flying saucer-like new stadiums.\n\nBut the success of the Premier League also owed something to events on the pitch. If Hillsborough marked a nadir for English football, the 1990 World Cup in Italy -- and Paul Gascoigne's tears during the national side's epic semifinal defeat by West Germany -- offered a moment of catharsis that rekindled many casual fan's residual love for the game.\n\nSubtle changes to the rules implemented worldwide by FIFA, including banning back passes to goalkeepers, automatic sendings off for professional fouls and changing the offside rule to give the benefit of the doubt to forward players, gradually made the game a more attractive spectacle.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of Alex Ferguson's young and exciting Manchester United team as the Premier League's dominant force, perfectly captured the spirit of the new age yet grounded the game in the traditions of the past.\n\nFinally, the 1995 Bosman Ruling, which granted players across Europe freedom of movement when out of contract, and the end of restrictions on the number of foreign players teams could field, created an international transfer market which lifted the horizons of the English game and brought genuine world class stars including Eric Cantona and Dennis Bergkamp, and eventually Cristiano Ronaldo and Fernando Torres, to the Premier League.\n\nStill, for many football fans, the glamour and wealth of the Premier League, with its homogenized stadiums and corporate entertainment suites -- in which clubs are bought and sold by global plutocrats from Siberia to Texas via Thailand and Abu Dhabi -- represents a betrayal of the sport's traditional values.\n\n\"There's still a powerful nostalgia among fans of my generation for a lost, less aggressively commercial era of football, when the game seemed less cynically concerned with exploiting the loyalty of those who pay to watch and with selling itself to a global audience,\" says Cowley.\n\nYet in a week when four Premier League sides featured in the quarterfinals of the Champions League and public appetite for the game appears insatiable, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that English football is in a better state than anyone who witnessed the horror at Hillsborough 20 years ago could ever have dared believe.\n\nMore importantly, it is virtually inconceivable to imagine the circumstances in which 96 fans died ever being repeated in an English stadium.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- The murder of rapper Dolla reverberated throughout the music industry on Tuesday as police sought a motive for the brazen killing.\n\n\n\nRap artist Dolla was known as a nice guy who survived a rough childhood.\n\n\n\nThe aspiring Southern hip-hop artist, whose real name was Roderick Anthony Burton II, was gunned down in the busy parking lot of the upscale Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles, California, on Monday afternoon.\n\n\n\nPolice later arrested Aubrey Louis Berry, 23, at Los Angeles International Airport, a Los Angeles Police statement said. No other details were given about Berry.\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old rapper was based in Atlanta, Georgia. He was in Los Angeles to work on his debut album.\n\n\n\nThose who knew him said that despite coming from a rough background, Burton was extremely gracious and polite.\n\n\n\n\"Everything with Dolla was 'please' and 'thank you,' \" said Ant Rich, manager of A&R for Jive Records, who discovered the rapper for the label when Burton was 17 and helped sign him a year later. \"The streets did not define him at all. He was bigger than that.\"\n\n\n\nDolla was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of singer Akon, who collaborated with him on his first single, \"Who the F--- is That?\" which also featured another high-profile artist, T-Pain. Another Dolla song, \"Feelin' Myself,\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 movie \"Step Up.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to his official MySpace page, Dolla was born in Chicago, Illinois, and his family relocated to Los Angeles soon after.\n\n\n\nHe was 5 years old when he and his older sister, Divinity, witnessed their father committing suicide. After that incident, their mother moved the family to Atlanta, according to his biography.\n\n\n\nThe Burton family released the following statement on Tuesday:\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost we, the family, would like to thank everyone for all their kind thoughts and prayers. Furthermore, the family would like to note that rumored details of the shooting on popular Web/blog sites are false.\n\n\n\n\"Due to the circumstances of the situation, no other information will be released at this time. We are grateful for your continuous support and would be very appreciative if we could mourn this loss in private.\n\n\n\n\"Additionally, information released before and after this official statement are not confirmed nor should they be considered accurate.\"\n\n\n\nRich said Dolla, who also did some modeling for P. Diddy's Sean John label, loved his family deeply. He was the guy with the great smile who would do things like offer to pick up the bill after a meeting with music executives, Rich said.\n\n\n\n\"You would tell him 'Look Dolla, you don't have to do that because we get reimbursed for this' and he would say 'No, no you got it last time, let me,' \" Rich said. \"The world lost a really good kid and he had the biggest heart.\"\n\n\n\nDeAngelo Jones books talent for BET and got to know Dolla after he performed at the network's \"Spring Bling\" event last year.\n\n\n\nHe said the artist was humbled and grateful for the success he was starting to find in the industry.\n\n\n\n\"That energy was what drew me to him,\" said Jones, who stayed in touch with Dolla after the show and often ran into him at other events. \"A lot of times there are negative associations that go along with being a rapper, but he was not at all what the image of a rapper is portrayed to be.\"\n\n\n\nJones said he was at the Beverly Center only a short time before the shooting occurred. Jones said it was unfortunate that Dolla's slaying is yet another incident that will link hip-hop with violence.\n\n\n\n\"Hip-hop gets such a bad rap, ever since the deaths of Biggie and Tupac,\" Jones said. \"[Dolla] just wanted to be successful, help other people and do the right thing. What's so hard for me is to see where his life was heading, because he was definitely on the right course.\"\n\n\n\nJerry Barrow, senior editor for The Urban Daily, a publication devoted to African-Americans in pop culture, noted that it was unfortunate that Dolla is finding mainstream recognition posthumously.\n\n\n\n\"With his modeling and his music, he did more before the age of 20 than many people do,\" Barrow said. \"It's a shame that this is how many people are now discovering him and his music.\"\n\n\n\nRashan Ali, a disc jockey with Atlanta's Hot 107.9 radio station, said the city has a thriving hip-hop community. Her station, which plays hip-hop, often has its lobby filled with aspiring artists trying to get their music heard.\n\n\n\nWith the success of Atlanta-based artists like rappers T.I., Outkast, and Young Jeezy, more and more young people are drawn to the area to try and make the connections that will find them fame, Ali said.\n\n\n\nThat Dolla was killed while pursuing his craft is especially sad, she said.\n\n\n\n\"[Dolla] was minding his business, in Los Angeles trying to record his music and this happens,\" Ali said. \"It's horrific and now a mother has to bury her child. It's senseless.\"",

See video of launch \u00bb\n\nThe weight of the fairing caused the rocket and the satellite to come crashing down to Earth about three minutes later.\n\nA team of investigators will look into what caused the payload fairing to fail to separate.\n\n\"We'll get back to flying at a pace that allows us to do so successfully,\" said Chuck Dovale, NASA Launch Director, at a press briefing after the failed launch.\n\nThe $273 million satellite, called the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, would have collected global measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere to help better forecast changes in carbon-dioxide levels and their effect on the Earth's climate.\n\nCarbon dioxide is considered a greenhouse gas because it traps heat, which scientists believe contributes to the warming of the planet. Carbon dioxide also absorbs wavelengths of light, and the NASA observatory would have measured levels of the gas partly by using instruments to analyze light reflected off the Earth.\n\nThe OCO also would have provided information about CO2 \"sinks\" -- areas, like oceans or landfills, that absorb and store carbon dioxide. NASA officials said all measurements would be combined with the findings of ground observation stations, providing a more complete account of the human and natural sources of CO2.\n\nThe OCO project took eight years to develop, said Michael Frelich, director of the NASA Earth Science Division. Its failure is a great loss for the science community, he said.",

  "context": "San Francisco (CNN) -- Remember when Hotmail was hot?\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Craddock, who manages the group responsible for Microsoft's Web-based e-mail service, can still recall the day of celebration in 2004 when the Hotmail division had just posted a stunning financial quarter. Craddock, along with other Microsoft execs and developers, convened to relish in the victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe triumph was short-lived because soon after, Google launched a competing Webmail service called Gmail, and like in the short time it takes Google to call up a search query, Hotmail instantly looked dated.\n\n\n\n\n\nGmail gave users a gigabyte of file storage for free, while Hotmail presented a few megabytes and required users to pay for more. Gmail was fast, spam-free and let people attach files several times larger than that of Hotmail. And Gmail only showed small text advertisements, while Hotmail's pages were covered in ads, which is why the site was able to exceed financial goals during that quarter in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter evaluating the options, \"it wasn't hard to pick Gmail; it just wasn't hard,\" Craddock said in an interview on Monday. \"It was a great learning experience about what really matters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few years of lightning-fast growth for Gmail following its launch and at the expense of Hotmail, Microsoft reversed course. \"We set out to really invest in Hotmail and really, to rebuild it from the ground up,\" said Chris Jones, a vice president who oversees several of Microsoft's Internet applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hotmail team eventually got the green light to dial down the ads while increasing development on features made available to nonpaying users.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking money directly from Hotmail \"is not the most important thing for us to optimize for,\" Jones said in an interview. \"The lesson from some of the most successful Internet companies is they build something valuable and durable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is a notion, Jones said, that Microsoft learned from a rival, Google, and from a partner, Facebook. It is not conventional wisdom for Microsoft, which makes most of its revenue from software sold for hundreds of dollars a package in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe people who write the history of technology tend to take shortcuts. Accounts of Friendster's, Myspace's and AOL's fall from grace are often summed up as: they just stopped being cool. In fact, they were less reliable and less capable than their scrappier competition. The same was true of Hotmail, but Microsoft is fighting back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Redmond, Washington, company gathered reporters together here at an art gallery in San Francisco on Monday to show PowerPoint slides that demonstrate how Hotmail is just as feature-rich, if not more so, than Gmail. Microsoft is putting muscle behind features such as granular controls over daily-deal messages and newsletters, automatic filtering and various new functions that launch in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese changes are already being touted to current users of Microsoft's e-mail service in a banner that urges them to look out for \"the new Hotmail.\" It's a part of a campaign to improve the brand's image, so that people aren't embarrassed to say their e-mail address ends in @hotmail.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For a lot of folks, Hotmail was their first Webmail address,\" Jones said. \"Now the challenge that we're fighting, frankly, is mostly one of perception.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHotmail still holds the highest market share worldwide, followed by Yahoo Mail and then Gmail, according to research firm ComScore. In the U.S., Yahoo is the leader, and this year, Gmail surpassed Hotmail and maintains faster growth, ComScore says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe options for free e-mail are poised to increase, with other tech giants making bids for the space that follows your name and the \"at\" symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple will discuss its iCloud service at a news conference on Tuesday, which is the first time the company will give out free e-mail access, in this case, an @me.com address, to customers. Facebook recently gave each of its 800 million users an @facebook.com alias, but few people seem eager to use them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is hoping to regain some cool in the hopes of hanging onto the friends it still has -- and to make new ones, before the new kids take over the block.",

It will be hard to explain but it is what it is. I want to enjoy the weekend, have a lot of fun, and try and do the best I can do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want to enjoy the whole atmosphere.

  "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,\" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert  to call the tip line at (843) 524-2777. Police also are seeking help from anyone who saw the Calverts' 2006 Mercedes Benz E320, Georgia Tech license plate GT821B on or about March 3, 2008.",

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the nomination with Harding by her side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The TSA administrator is among the most important, unfilled posts in the Obama administration,\" Napolitano said. \"The president and I both believe that Gen. Harding has the experience and perspective to make a real difference in carrying out the mission of this agency.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there were ever a nominee that warranted expedited, and detailed, consideration in the Senate, this is it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama announced the nomination in a White House news release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am confident that Bob's talent and expertise will make him a tremendous asset in our ongoing efforts to bolster security and screening measures at our airports,\" Obama said. \"I can think of no one more qualified than Bob to take on this important job, and I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TSA has been under the leadership of an acting administrator since Edmund \"Kip\" Hawley resigned at the end of the Bush administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September, Obama nominated Erroll Southers, a Los Angeles airport police department official, to the head the agency. But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthers withdrew his nomination in January after lawmakers questioned his changing explanation about a personnel action taken against him decades ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarding would be the TSA's first African-American administrator.

  "context": "Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you.\n\n\n\nRoland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet.\n\n\n\nOne week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead.\n\n\n\nThe rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition.\n\n\n\nThen there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging.\n\n\n\nUltimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened.\n\n\n\nThere has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\"\n\n\n\nSorry, Rick, I disagree.\n\n\n\nThe most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control.\n\n\n\nRunning with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire.\n\n\n\nIn one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth.\n\n\n\nWe should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story.\n\n\n\nThe rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone.\n\n\n\nThe National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff.\n\n\n\nNo media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more.\n\n\n\nWe have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot.\n\n\n\nIn the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over.\n\n\n\nRoland S.

  "context": "They're bigger, brawnier, and faster than the typical male, but are National Football League players healthier than other men their age?\n\n\n\nJustin Bannan, who plays for the Baltimore Ravens, participated in the study on NFL players.\n\n\n\nYes and no, according to a new NFL-funded study that looks at the cardiovascular health of young athletes.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that NFL players have cholesterol levels similar to other men in their 20s and 30s, and their blood sugar tends to be even healthier. However, they are much more likely to have high blood pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who aren't professional athletes.\n\n\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction to have this study,\" says Justin Bannan, 30, who plays defensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens and took part in the research. \"I think the more information we can find out and the more studies we can do, the better.\"\n\n\n\nThe study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is important, particularly as more and more players are weighing in at 300-plus pounds. The extra weight could potentially strain an athlete's heart in youth or even after retirement, and many question whether it has played a role in a handful of high-profile deaths. Health.com: Eat right advice: Fiber, starch, fats, serving sizes\n\n\n\nIn particular, the death of Thomas Herrion at age 23 has raised concerns about the heart health of larger players. Herrion, who was 6'3\" and 330 pounds, had just finished an exhibition game with the San Francisco 49ers when he collapsed and died in 2005.\n\n\n\n\"He's sort of the prototype of the bigger, stronger linemen that populates the NFL now, as compared with 20 or 30 years ago,\" says lead study author Dr. Andrew M. Tucker, the team physician for the Baltimore Ravens. \"We have so many big, strong guys over 300 pounds. I think that case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the investigation.\"\n\n\n\nOther heavy players-- such as defensive end Reggie White-- have also died at an early age. White was 43 when he died from cardiac arrhythmia in 2004.\n\n\n\nIn the study, Tucker, who is the cochair of the NFL subcommittee on cardiovascular health, and his colleagues looked at 504 active players from 12 teams in 2007. The researchers measured the players' height, weight, percentage of body fat, and other factors, and then compared them to 1,959 men ages 23 to 35 who participated in a study called CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). Health.com: 20 little ways to lose drop the pounds and keep them off\n\n\n\nThey found that players were less likely to smoke or have blood-sugar problems than other men (only 6.7 percent of players had impaired fasting glucose compared to 15.5 percent of other men) and their cholesterol levels were essentially the same. However, 13.8 percent of players had high blood pressure and 64.5 percent had prehypertension, or borderline high blood pressure, compared to 5.5 percent and 24.2 percent of other men, respectively.\n\n\n\nTucker notes that the football players outweighed the men in the CARDIA study by an average of 70 pounds and that it's natural to assume that larger people may have higher blood pressure.\n\n\n\n\"But what was fascinating to us was the category of prehypertension,\" says  Tucker, who is also the medical director of sports medicine at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Health.com: How to eat out without getting fat\n\n\n\nThe study found that NFL athletes are more likely to have prehypertension than other men-- regardless of the size of the player or his position.\n\n\n\n\"So our lean players who play defensive back and wide receiver, they have prevalence of prehypertension just as common as the really big guys playing offensive and defensive line,\" says Tucker. \"So there's something that we're trying to investigate now that accounts for elevated blood pressures in our active players that is not accounted for by size alone-- there's got to be something else.\" Health.com: Cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions\n\n\n\nThat \"something else\" could be strength or resistance training, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sleep apnea (which is characterized by heavy snoring and a hike in blood pressure), or diet, including excessive sodium intake. Dr. Tucker doesn't think anabolic steroids are to blame. Even though he and his colleagues didn't ask players if they used steroids, he says that the NFL's year-round testing program should have ruled out any use.\n\n\n\n\"[However] I'm concerned about the widespread use of performance-enhancing agents, which contain stimulants that can not only increase blood pressure but of course have stimulating effects on the heart,\" says Dr. Tucker. He adds that, in the last several years, such stimulants have been linked to sporadic deaths in college and even professional athletes.\n\n\n\nAlthough today's players are much more likely to weigh in excess of 300 pounds than those in the past, it doesn't necessarily mean they are fat, Dr. Tucker explains. Athletes are larger nowadays due to rule changes in the 1970s and 1980s that were aimed at protecting their lower bodies; those guidelines also gave larger players a competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nIf one goes by body mass index alone-- a measure of height and weight that doesn't take into account muscle mass-- more than half of players are obese, according to a 2005 study.\n\n\n\nHowever, Tucker and his team found that the average percentage of body fat was 14 percent, ranging from 8 percent to 10 percent in the leaner positions-- such as wide receivers and linebackers-- to 20 percent in defensive linemen and 25 percent in offensive linemen.\n\n\n\n\"Even our offensive linemen are really on the upper limits of what's considered healthy,\" says Tucker. \"There are plenty of my regular patients who would take that.\" Health.com: Olympic swimmer discusses life with exercise-induced asthma\n\n\n\nOverall, Tucker says he is most worried about older, retired athletes.\n\n\n\n\"I'm concerned about whether there is a constellation of things going on that puts them at risk when they're 45 or 55,\" he says.\n\n\n\nMore attention is being paid to detraining athletes so that they can adopt healthier lifestyles and better nutrition after they retire, says William Kraemer, Ph.D., a professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut.\n\n\n\n\"It really is tough because you're trying to stay big in your playing days,\" says Kraemer. \"The big fear is, [after retirement] you stop exercising and you keep eating the way you used to when you were expending a lot of calories. A lot of times when kids get out of college or they get out of the pros, there is no system in place that helps them make the transition.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ravens' Bannan says the older generation is teaching younger players the importance of changing their lifestyle after retirement.\n\n\n\n\"If you're a heavier player, a lineman that's over 300 pounds, really what it comes down to is a lifestyle change and eating healthier, losing weight when you are done, and staying active and staying healthy,\" says Bannan, who is 6'3\" and 310 pounds. \"Make a few changes in your life; I think that's going to make things a lot better for you down the road.\"\n\n\n\nEnter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A Buffalo, New York, man is due in court Thursday to face charges that he raped a 13-year-old runaway police say he held prisoner in his home for six months.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael J. Abdallah, 26, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree rape, unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference. Thursday's hearing will determine if the case should be referred to a grand jury.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffalo police said that Abdallah kept the girl in his home from July through December 2009, behind dead-bolt locks and doors with no doorknobs. A criminal complaint alleges that Abdallah had sex with her more than 100 times. Police spokesman Michael DeGeorge said Abdallah also forced the girl to baby-sit his year-old son.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdallah is unmarried, and the identity of the child's mother is not known. Police would not say how the girl left Adbdallah's home, why there was a delay from December to February for his arrest or where the teenager is now.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdallah was arrested Friday when police raided his home on a child-abuse allegation, Buffalo media reported. The next day, Buffalo City Court Judge James A.W. McLeod set bond at $250,000 in an arraignment at which Abdallah represented himself. He has since been provided with a court-appointed attorney, according to media reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut friends of the defendant told the Buffalo News that he was nothing more than a Good Samaritan trying to help a runaway girl he met in a Buffalo park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody has had their moments, but Mike is not a monster. As long as I've known Mike, he's always been kindhearted to me. If he could help you, he will help you,\" Alicia Bellaus, 20, who grew up next door to Abdallah's relatives, told the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mike always had her calling to someone, supposedly her aunt, to say she was doing OK. From what I knew, her aunt or her mom knew where she was staying,\" said Bellaus, who previously had a romantic relationship with Abdallah. \"To look at her, she is very developed physically, and you would think that she is older than 13.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBellaus said the girl told her she was 17 or 18 and denied having sex with Abdallah, and that she also said she did not want to go home to her mother, the News said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice told the News that the family filed several missing person reports after the girl disappeared in July. And an unnamed law enforcement official told the paper that Abdallah was a manipulative drug dealer who \"lured her in\" and kept her trapped physically and psychologically. CNN, however, could not confirm that official's view.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Kimble, who lives four doors from Abdallah, said he was surprised when he learned about the accusations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a street where everyone knows everyone,\" said Kimble, who remembered Abdallah moving in about a year-and-a-half ago. \"I never recall him with a 13-year-old girl.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKimble said Abdallah was seldom home, and their brief conversations were limited to Abdallah's two dogs. Other neighbors told Kimble the house had a steady stream of visitors on any given day.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- \"Usually when I mention suspended animation people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh,\" says scientist Mark Roth. But he's not referring to the plot of a \"Star Trek\" episode.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoth is completely serious about using lessons he's learned from putting some organisms into suspended animation to help people survive medical trauma. He spoke at the TED2010 conference in Long Beach, California, in February.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe winner of a MacArthur genius fellowship in 2007, Roth described the thought process that led him and fellow researchers to explore ways to lower animals' metabolism to the point where they showed no signs of life -- and yet were not dead. More remarkably, they were able to restore the animals to normal life, with no apparent damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Roth on TED.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Web site of Roth's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, describes the research this way: \"We use the term suspended animation to refer to a state where all observable life processes (using high resolution light microscopy) are stopped: The animals do not move nor breathe and the heart does not beat. We have found that we are able to put a number of animals (yeast, nematodes, drosophila, frogs and zebrafish) into a state of suspended animation for up to 24 hours through one basic technique: reducing the concentration of oxygen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Mark Roth's laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\nRoth is investigating the use of small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, a gas that is toxic in larger quantities, to lower metabolism. In his talk, he imagined that \"in the not too distant future, an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide, or some related compound, to a person suffering severe injuries, and that person might de-animate a bit ... their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then, after they get that care ... they'll wake up. A miracle? We hope not, or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A court in Zambia has acquitted a newspaper editor who was tried on obscenity charges for mailing photographs of a woman giving birth.\n\n\n\nChansa Kabwela, the editor of the Post, wanted to highlight the conditions in which women were being forced to give birth during a hospital strike last summer. She mailed pictures to government ministers of a woman delivering a baby in a hospital parking lot.\n\n\n\nBut Zambian President Rupiah Banda described the photos as pornographic and Kabwela was ordered arrested.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, a judge in the capital Lusaka ruled there was no evidence the photos were obscene or could corrupt public morals. He dismissed the case.\n\n\n\nKabwela was out of the office Wednesday and could not immediately be reached.\n\n\n\nBut as she exited the courtroom, she told Reporters Without Borders that she was relieved.\n\n\n\n\"My victory is also a victory for all those who suffered during the health sector strikes,\" she said. \"I am happy the court acquitted me. I had no intention of causing anyone any harm. The letter I wrote to the vice-president was very clear. I just wanted to draw his attention to the situation in the hospitals.\"\n\n\n\nThe month-long nurse's strike in June was over pay and benefits. It shut down hospital wards, turning away hundreds of patients.\n\n\n\nAt the time, a woman's husband snapped pictures as she gave birth in the hospital parking lot after being denied admission. The baby later died, said the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\n\n\nThe husband gave the photos to the Post who deemed them to graphic to publish.\n\n\n\nKabwela then included them in a letter she wrote to the vice president, the health minister and several non-governmental organizations urging that the strike be settled.\n\n\n\nSoon afterward, Banda ordered police to take action against Kabwela.\n\n\n\nJournalism advocacy groups believe Banda retaliated against the newspaper because of its frequent criticism of his policies.\n\n\n\nAt least six members of the newspaper's staff have been physically or verbally attacked by leaders of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy since the year began, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.",

Mickael Silvestre failed to clear the ball on the edge of the area and it fell to Messi, who curled home a superb equalizer.\n\n\n\n\n\nMessi added his and Barca's second on 37 minutes. Eric Abidal's cross from the right was cut out by Thomas Vermaelen.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the rest of the Arsenal defense were slow to react and Pedro found Messi, who smashed his shot past Manuel Almunia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe striker completed his stunning hat-trick four minutes before the break when he raced onto a header from Abidal to sprint clear of the Arsenal defense before superbly chipping the ball over Almunia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, Arsenal needed two goals to go through and, in truth, they never looked likely to get them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBendtner struck the post with a fierce header from Gael Clichy's cross, but he was flagged offside, and Tomas Rosicky fired over the bar when in a great position.\n\n\n\n\n\nMessi completed the job three minutes from time, beating two defender on the left hand side of the area before firing the ball through Almunia's legs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result means Barcelona will now face Italian champions Inter Milan, who they were drawn against in the group stages, in a mouth-watering semifinal clash.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger was full of praise for Messi's performance. \"For me, he is the best player in the world, and by a distance,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When he's in the game, he's really dangerous. Once he is on the run with the ball, he is unstoppable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman added: \"I believe that we lost against a team that is better than us and have the best player in the world.\"",

  "context": "(CNN) -- A leading figure in French President Nicolas Sarkozy's party, the UMP, has dismissed any suggestion that ex-International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was set up when he was arrested on charges of sexual assault in New York in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To imagine that what would have happened to Mr. Strauss-Kahn would be the object of some sort of complicity from the UMP, it seems too hard to believe,\" said Jean-Francois Cope, secretary-general of the UMP party.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped in August after questions were raised over the credibility of his accuser, hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo. However, the scandal ended both his career at the IMF and any hope of the leading Socialist politician challenging Sarkozy in next year's presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow an article in the New York Review of Books says Strauss-Kahn suspected a cellphone that disappeared just before his arrest had earlier been hacked. It also describes CCTV footage showing employees of the Sofitel hotel appearing to celebrate after the maid reported the alleged attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nA female friend of Strauss-Kahn allegedly warned him that an email he had sent had been read at UMP offices in Paris. If this was the case it meant, according to the New York Review of Books, \"he had reason to suspect he might be under electronic surveillance in New York. He had already been warned by a friend in the French diplomatic corps that an effort would be made to embarrass him with a scandal. The warning that his BlackBerry might have been hacked was therefore all the more alarming.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author of the New York Review of Books story, Edward Epstein, told Agence-France Presse: \"I didn't say it was a political conspiracy but I would say that people wanted to find evidence of an indiscretion of his that could derail either his (French presidential) candidacy or even (his work at) the IMF.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, William Taylor, also told the news agency his client was possibly \"the target of a deliberate effort to destroy him as a political force.\" However, Taylor did not say exactly who might be to blame.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn France, right-wing politicians described the entire story as pure fantasy. \"For me, if there are facts, if there is clear evidence, of course, it goes without saying that conclusions will have to be drawn,\" said the UMP's Cope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As long as they are only rumors, gossip, allegations on the basis of anonymous testimony, which we know absolutely nothing about, you can understand that we remain a little more reserved and certainly not fooled.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a television interview following his return to Paris, Strauss-Kahn confessed to a \"moral weakness\" and an \"inappropriate relationship\" with Diallo, but denied any violence or aggression. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo in New York, but he has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing his job gave him immunity from civil cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York hotel where the alleged incident was reported also dismissed the story as \"inaccurate and speculative.\" The Sofitel hotel chain released a statement saying: \"The article states that two Sofitel employees were seen 'celebrating' on tape for three minutes. In fact, the incident in question lasted only eight seconds and both employees categorically deny this exchange had anything to do with Mr. Strauss-Kahn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sofitel Luxury Hotels has cooperated with law enforcement authorities for the entirety of this case as was its civic and legal obligation. As the civil trial remains pending in the U.S., it would not be appropriate to comment on the facts of the case.\"",

  "context": "Editor's Note: David Hawkins is Director of Public Policy and Research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling, a nonprofit organization that represents more than 11,000 high school counselors and college admission officers from across the country. He was the author of a report last month by the organization's commission on the use of standardized tests.\n\n\n\nDavid Hawkins says test scores shouldn't be used to rank college quality\n\n\n\nARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A recent controversy at Baylor University has brought new attention to the widespread misuse of standardized college admission tests to rank the quality of America's colleges and universities.\n\n\n\nThe SAT and ACT have achieved nearly iconic status in America and throughout the world. As the late author and scholar Stephen Jay Gould noted, the tests are viewed by many as \"abstruse and mysterious,\" with powerful effects on public policy, social mobility, and even individual identity.\n\n\n\nMisuse of test scores as college ranking criteria creates undue pressure on admission offices to pursue increasingly high test scores and fuels the tests' disproportionate influence.\n\n\n\nLast June, Baylor University encouraged its already admitted first-year students to retake the SAT. The reward for students who retook the test was $300 in bookstore credits. Students who increased their score by more than 50 points got a $1,000 merit aid scholarship. If enough students retook the SAT and increased their scores, the gains might be enough to move Baylor up the rankings list.\n\n\n\nThe scarce financial resources allocated for this plan are too badly needed elsewhere, particularly among low-income students in rural and urban areas around the country, to spend on an effort to raise a college's SAT profile. A Baylor spokesman told The Associated Press Thursday that the university \"goofed\" and would likely end the incentives.\n\n\n\nIt's critical to understand that high SAT and ACT scores alone do not equate to merit. Last month, our organization's Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission issued a report calling for change in the way everyone involved in college admissions uses the tests.\n\n\n\nTest misuses feed the public perception that the scores are the most influential factor in college admission. For the past 15 years, National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) research has shown that students' grades in high school, particularly grades in college preparatory courses, are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions.\n\n\n\nOne of the most pressing problems regarding the SAT and ACT scores is their misuse in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings formula.\n\n\n\nThe SAT and ACT were designed to provide information about a student to colleges and universities and were never meant to be measures of college quality. Accordingly, the commission encouraged U.S. News and World Report to eliminate test scores as a measure of institutional quality.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. News ranking formula includes a \"student selectivity\" score that constitutes 15 percent of a college's overall rank. SAT or ACT scores of enrollees make up 50 percent of the student selectivity score.\n\n\n\nIn response to the NACAC report, U.S. News and World Report said, \"As long as standardized tests play an integral role in the college admissions process, U.S. News will use them as part of our ranking methodology.\"\n\n\n\nThe situation at Baylor is a reminder of the inflated value assigned to the SAT and ACT in higher education. The fervor surrounding the rankings, as well as the lengths to which colleges go to increase them, are unfortunate distractions in higher education and admissions.\n\n\n\nThe impression students and families get from the rankings is that higher test scores mean higher quality colleges. To borrow a phrase familiar to admission deans, many colleges recruit great students and then graduate great students. Is that because of the institution, or the students?\n\n\n\nSome credit undoubtedly should go to both. But is a college of lower quality because its students' SAT scores are lower than those of students at another college?\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the ability of admission tests to predict success in higher education is much more limited than most people think. Colleges most often determine the utility of admission test scores by assessing how well they predict first-year grades.\n\n\n\nColleges are wrong to place so much emphasis on test scores as measurements of their institutional worth when admission offices across the board consider the scores to be one among many indicators of a student's merit.\n\n\n\nAs influential as the rankings have been with students and families, is it any wonder that colleges whose stakeholders often demand higher ranks go to such lengths to influence their position in the rankings?\n\n\n\nMisuse of test scores has real ramifications for students and families. For every student able to afford test-performance tutoring and fees for taking the test many times, there are many qualified students from under-served backgrounds who become discouraged that they will be unable to compete.\n\n\n\nFor every college that raises its SAT or ACT profile for rankings purposes, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of qualified students who will never apply because artificially inflated test scores signal yet another barrier to higher education.\n\n\n\nIt is critical to re-evaluate the varied uses of admission tests, and protect against their misuse in all forms.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Hawkins.",

PAUL, Minnesota (CNN)  -- After rubbing shoulders with Susan Sarandon, Danny Glover, Charlize Theron and Charles Barkley at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, New York Post celebrity gossip columnist Cindy Adams jetted off to \"one of the dullest towns in America,\" according to her latest column, to sniff out politically-inclined celebs in St. Paul.\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know [Sarah Palin] from an Alaskan salmon!\" columnist Cindy Adams says.\n\n\n\nWhat does John McCain running mate Sarah Palin have in common with an Alaskan salmon? And who will win November? Just a few of the five questions we put to the woman famous for knowing famous people over dinner at the CNN Grill.\n\n\n\nCNN.com: First things first: Celebrity-wise, does the Republican convention compare to Denver?\n\n\n\nAdams: It doesn't. It can't compare, because Hollywood is very left-wing. And there were so many celebrities in Denver. Everywhere you looked, you fell over somebody who thought they were important. Here, not.\n\n\n\nCNN.com: Is that a good or bad thing?\n\n\n\nAdams: It makes for more excitement. It makes for more media attention. J.Lo, you got Spike Lee, you got Ashley Judd. They're all schlepping around thinking they're saving the world, see, thinking they're saving mankind. You don't have that here.\n\n\n\nCNN.com: What do you hope to accomplish by attending this convention?\n\n\n\nAdams: I would like to help McCain have a fine election. I would like to wave my flag. I'm a patriotic red, white and blue flag-waving American. If this is our system, then I want it to work. And I just want McCain to have an equal shot just like [Barack] Obama did.\n\n\n\nCNN.com: What are your thoughts on McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin?\n\n\n\nAdams: I don't know! I don't know this woman! I mean I wouldn't know her from an Alaskan salmon. None of us knew her. it's going to take six months to figure out what she does other than make mooseburgers! I do not know this lady. I'm sure she's wonderful. I'm not bright enough to have made a vice presidential pick. But it's going to take us six months to know who she is. Right now, I don't like the fact that she mispronounces \"I\"-raq and \"I\"-ran. If she would say Iraq and Iran, I would be happier.\n\n\n\nCNN.com: Any thoughts on who will win in November?\n\n\n\nAdams: Of course, I'm right here at the Republican Convention, and I'm picking up [on] what they're saying, obviously. I sort of think that when it finally gets down to it, not everybody in Middle America is going to press the lever for Obama. I just don't think he's ready. I sort of think there will be upset. But I'm picking up the vibes from the Republican convention.",

  "context": "(CNN)  -- At least 23 people died Saturday when a protest rally turned violent outside Madagascar's Presidential Palace, a fire official at the main hospital said.\n\n\n\nPeople duck to avoid gunfire Saturday in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.\n\n\n\nThe official said 83 people were injured during the demonstration in the capital city of Antananarivo, according to journalist Dregoire Pourtier, who passed the information to CNN.\n\n\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped at least 18 injured people, press officer Mbola Ramamanana said.\n\n\n\nBrittany Martin, an American who is a Harvard Fellow and lives near the palace, said she could hear the crowd cheering amid intermittent gunshots and noises that may have been tear gas canisters. iReport.com: Are you there?\n\n\n\n\"From the window I can see military cars and ambulances driving by,\" Martin said. \"Nothing is up in smoke. We know there have been people killed from French and Malagasy news reports.\n\n\n\n\"We can see the back of the president's palace. This morning was totally peaceful. We knew that Andry [Rajoelina] was unveiling his new government at the May 13th Plaza, which was peaceful,\" she said, citing a friend who was there.\n\n\n\nMadagascar's government is in flux.\n\n\n\nPresident Marc Ravalomanana fired Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and put someone else in the job, but Rajoelina is still technically mayor and claims to head a transitional national government.\n\n\n\nMartin said she heard gunshots starting about 2 p.m., after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from.\n\n\n\nSome media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd.\n\n\n\nViolence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo.\n\n\n\nHours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks before, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.\n\n\n\nRavalomanana took power in 2001 after ousting Ratsiraka in a tense, hotly contested election. Ratsiraka fled to France afterward. Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble.\n\n\n\nThere is also anger in Madagascar -- where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year -- over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane.\n\n\n\nLast Saturday, Rajoelina took to the streets, declaring himself the nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300.\n\n\n\nRajoelina urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government can be established in the island nation off Africa's southeastern coast.  Map \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"What we've been pushing for is dialogue the whole time,\" said Rodney Ford, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. He said he received reports that palace guards used tear gas and shot into the air to try to disperse the crowd.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think anyone wanted violence.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Madagascar has about 20 million people with ethnic origins in Africa and Asia. It was administered by the British Empire during much of the 19th century until it came under the control of France, from which it gained independence in 1960.",

She claims her father threatened to kill her.\n\n\n\nThe 17-year-old girl, Rifqa Bary, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\n\nBary's parents want her back home.\n\n\n\nAt a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them.\n\n\n\nAlso at the hearing, Judge Daniel Dawson of the Orange County Juvenile Court ordered the girl and her parents to seek the mediation within 30 days. The judge had previously ruled that the girl will remain in Florida foster care until the allegations are resolved.\n\n\n\nThe parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them. They denied they ever threatened to kill their daughter because she converted to Christianity.\n\n\n\nMohamed Bary told CNN he believes a lot of false information has been circulated about the case.\n\n\n\n\"We wouldn't do her harm,\" the father said, adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations.\n\n\n\n\"I have no problem with her practicing any faith,\" he said. But Bary conceded he would have preferred that his daughter practice the Muslim faith first.\n\n\n\nThe teen had heard of pastor Lorenz and his church through a prayer group on Facebook. The girl's parents reported her missing to Columbus police, who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records.\n\n\n\nThe teenager, in a sworn affidavit, claims her father, 47, was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to \"deal with the situation.\" In the court filing, Rifqa Bary stated her father said, \"If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me!\" The teenager claims her father added, \"I will kill you!\"  Watch the teen talk about her fears \u00bb\n\n\n\nAlso at Thursday's hearing, the judge sealed a report on the girl from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and issued a gag order for attorneys in the case.\n\n\n\nAt one point during the hearing, the girl's court-appointed guardian, Krista Bartholomew, told the court: \"This is not a holy war but a case about a broken family.\"\n\n\n\nOutside the courthouse after the hearing, a Muslim activist and several Christian activists exchanged words over the case.  Watch the heated exchanges \u00bb\n\n\n\nAnother hearing is scheduled for September 29 if the family is not able to resolve the conflict through mediation.",

  "context": "OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Fifth-grader Christopher Rodriguez sat down Thursday at his piano for his weekly lesson, arched his fingers over the keys and began to play.\n\n\n\n\n\n10-year-old Christopher Rodriguez was hit by a stray bullet, paralyzing him for life, doctors say.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the street from Harmony Road Music School in north Oakland, California, Jared Adams, 24, allegedly raised his gun at a Chevron gas station attendant during a holdup and fired.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bullet ripped through the walls of Christopher's classroom striking him in his side, piercing his kidney and spleen and lodging in his spine. The bullet barely missed the 10-year-old's heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe will likely be paralyzed for life from the waist down, doctors say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is probably the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my life. I love my son greatly,\" the boy's father, Richard Rodriguez, said Friday at a news conference.  Watch Christopher's dad describe the ordeal \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher loved music. He had recently taken up African drumming, spent hours listening to classical music and played basketball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel like half his life was taken from him; his inability, probably, to walk -- ever,\" Rodriguez said, his voice breaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher's mother, Jennifer Rodriguez, had been waiting outside in her SUV for her son's lesson to end.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe not only heard the shots but came close to being hit herself. At least two bullets from Adams' gun struck her vehicle, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the phone and distracted, she at first dismissed the noises as someone throwing rocks at her SUV. But when she realized it was gunfire, she dashed into her son's class. Christopher was on the floor, his classmates and instructor hovering over him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!\" Christopher cried.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs emergency workers rushed the boy to the hospital, police were chasing Adams, who was speeding away. Adams rammed his vehicle into a car carrying a woman and her two children and then slammed into a parked car, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woman and children escaped without injury, according to authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams was charged Monday with attempted murder, robbery, evading a police officer, driving recklessly and being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, Oakland Police Department spokesman Roland Holmgren told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's being held without bail, according to Holmgren. CNN was not immediately able to determine whether he had a lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities found a ski mask, loaded gun and cash at the scene. Adams has prior convictions for driving under the influence and gun possession, records show. He pleaded no contest to felony evading arrest in 2006 for fleeing an Emeryville police officer and had run from or physically resisted a California Highway Patrol officer and police in Albany and Berkeley, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams once complained in court that young people raised in the city like himself never got opportunities, the paper also reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams has been told about Christopher, said Holmgren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether it's your first day on the street as an officer or a veteran, to see a child doing something as innocent as taking a piano lesson and have this happen to him, it affects your soul,\" said Holmgren.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, doctors delivered tragic news about Christopher's future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's going to face years of rehabilitation,\" said Dr. James Betts, chief of surgery at Children's Hospital Oakland. \"We are all hoping there will be some degree of recovery. We feel like the injury is permanent, and the paralysis is permanent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It will be] a challenging life for this young boy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher's friends and fellow music lovers plan to help him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmony Road Music School will hold a benefit concert for the Rodriguez family February 10 at 2 p.m. at Chapel of the Chimes, a place of worship near the school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The family is going to have to, essentially, make a home for a disabled child now,\" said school owner Jim Callahan. \"They'll have to change the stairs in their home, make all sorts of expensive adjustments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCallahan met with instructors at Harmony Road Monday. They are talking about the incident with the students old enough to understand what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses have not stopped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Music has a healing quality all its own,\" said Callahan. \"We will not be terrorized by this.\" E-mail to a friend\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Dan Simon and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.",

  "context": "Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli government said Thursday it will stop a convoy of cargo and passenger ships filled with supplies and headed to Gaza to break a blockade imposed by Israel in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment officials said Wednesday they have given the Israeli Defense Forces instructions to reroute the flotilla to Ashdod port in Israel, where the supplies will be unloaded and transferred to Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, called the flotilla \"a cheap political stunt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they were really interested in the well being of the people of Gaza, they would have accepted the offers of Egypt or Israel to transfer humanitarian aid to the people  of Gaza, along with the other 15 thousand tons sent every week,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe convoy, which left various European ports, is organized by two major groups: the Free Gaza movement, a pro-Palestinian human rights organization, and the IHH movement, a Turkish humanitarian relief foundation affiliated with the Islamic Brotherhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizers said the convoy is carrying 10,000 tons of construction material, medical equipment and school supplies, and about 750 activists of different nationalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Yossi Gal, its director-general, has summoned the ambassadors of Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Sweden and Ireland -- the countries from which the flotilla set sail -- and \"clarified the state of Israel's official position, which declares the flotilla an absolute provocation: There is no shortage of humanitarian aid to Gaza, as food products, fuel and supplies are constantly transferred into the Gaza Strip by the international organizations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flotilla is \"invited to dock at Ashdod port, to unload their cargo and transfer it to Gaza, after a security check, either via the Israeli authorities or via the humanitarian organizations,\" the ministry said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHanin Zoabi, a member of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, and a passenger on the flotilla, called it a \"humanitarian campaign for the 1.5 million Palestinian people who Israel put in jail for about the last four years without allowing building material, without educational material, without food into the Gaza strip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Israel destroyed 165 schools and more than 100 (factories) and destroyed tens of thousands of houses without enabling the Palestinians to rebuild their homes and their lives,\" Zoabi said. \"This is a very strong political message towards Israel and towards the Arab world that stood silent regarding what is happening in Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael imposed the naval blockade on Gaza after the Hamas forcefully took control of  Gaza in 2007, ousting the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegev argued that the activists maintain a double standard when it comes to Hamas' actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They call themselves human rights activists, but they remain silent when it comes to Hamas' deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians  and the brutalities of the Hamas regime in Gaza, which has crushed political opposition, suppressed independent media and has locked up hundreds of political opponents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Weiss Maudi, an Israeli Foreign Ministry legal expert, said, \"The naval blockade has been imposed by Israel because Israel is currently in a state of armed conflict with the Hamas regime that controls Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder international maritime law, when a maritime blockade is in effect, no vessels can enter the blockaded area.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaritime blockades are a legitimate measure under international law, and may be implemented as part of an armed conflict at sea, Israeli officials have said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The objective of the boats is to break Israel's siege on Gaza, to break Israel's blockade on Gaza. The material that we have on board are all of the materials that Israel denied to the people of Gaza like cement, building supplies, educational supplies etc,\" said Greta Berlin, co-founder of Free Gaza movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do not accept the siege on Gaza,\" said Zoabi. \"... Israel does not want a siege. It wants a silent siege. Israel does not want occupation, it wants a silent occupation. It wants its policies to go without criticisms of the world. That's why it wants to stop the flotilla and also avoid coverage of the event,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"... This is an important aim of Israel, is to stop the cameras in order for the participants who are participating in this flotilla and the others who are following it not to see the aggression of the Israeli army, but I think this does not threaten us and it does not bring fear among us,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoam Shalit, father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, told CNN he offered through his lawyer to attempt to convince the Israeli government to let the flotilla arrive in Gaza if participants would pass aid, including letters and medicine, to his son. The organizers of the convoy, including Berlin, refused, he said, telling him their main purpose is to break the siege.\n\n\n\n\n\nGilad Shalit has been held captive since June 2006, when Palestinian militants from Gaza captured him. Noam Shalit says his son has been kept in total isolation for the past four years, a violation of international conventions and against international law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been eight naval convoys to Gaza until now, and Israel has allowed three to dock at the Gaza port.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said that since January 2009, more than a million tons of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most efficient system to transfer goods to Gaza is through the land crossings, Palmor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he was concerned about being arrested, Zoabi told CNN, \"I am not worried because I am not doing anything against the law. What I do is according to human rights, according to international values and according to universal values, so it is not against the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am (a) Knesset member, and this is part of my political responsibility,\" she said. \"It is part of my human responsibility. This is not against the law to aid people, to help and support (those) who are under siege ... I think the side that is breaking the law, international law, and breaking the human values is Israel and not anyone else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.",

  "context": "(CNN) -- The commissioner of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, police department said Thursday he \"deeply regrets\" the arrest of prominent black Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., but stands by the procedures followed by his department.\n\n\n\nSgt. Jim Crowley said he has nothing to apologize for in regards to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr.\n\n\n\n\"I believe that Sgt. [James] Crowley acted in a way that is consistent with his training at the department, and consistent with national standards of law enforcement protocol,\" Commissioner Robert Haas said, referring to the officer who made the July 16 arrest at the professor's home.\n\n\n\n\"I do not believe his actions in any way were racially motivated,\" Haas said at a news conference.\n\n\n\nGates was arrested for disorderly conduct after an exchange with the officer, who was investigating a report of a possible break-in at the house.\n\n\n\nThe police department will create a panel of \"independent, notable professionals\" to provide an analysis of the incident, he said.\n\n\n\nThe controversial arrest of Gates was criticized Wednesday by President Obama, who said the Cambridge police department \"acted stupidly.\"\n\n\n\n\"My response is that this department is deeply pained and takes its professional pride very seriously,\" Haas said.\n\n\n\nCambridge authorities dropped the charges against Gates on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the International Association of Chiefs of Police expressed disappointment in Obama's remarks.\n\n\n\n\"Police chiefs understand that it is critically important to have all the facts on any police matter before drawing conclusions or making any public statement,\" said Russell B. Laine, association president and chief of the Algonquin, Illinois, police department, in the statement. \"For these reasons, the IACP was disappointed in the president's characterization of the Cambridge Police Department.\"\n\n\n\nHaas' comments followed a statement earlier Thursday from Crowley, who said he would not apologize for his actions.\n\n\n\n\"That apology will never come from me as Jim Crowley. It won't come from me as sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department,\" Crowley told Boston radio station WEEI. \"Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge Police Department, which are beyond my control, I don't worry about that. I know what I did was right. I have nothing to apologize for.\"\n\n\n\nThe mayor of Cambridge said she will meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that led to Gates' arrest does not happen again.\n\n\n\n\"This suggests that something happened that should not have happened,\" E. Denise Simmons, Cambridge's mayor said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"The situation is certainly unfortunate. This can't happen again in Cambridge.\"\n\n\n\nObama defended Gates Wednesday night, while acknowledging that he may be \"a little biased,\" because Gates is a friend.\n\n\n\n\"But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.\"\n\n\n\nThe incident, Obama said, shows \"how race remains a factor in this society.\"\n\n\n\nCrowley also said he is exercising caution and his previous actions clearly show he is not a racist.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Crowley taught a racial profiling course at the Lowell Police Academy, said Deborah Friedl, deputy superintendent of the police department.\n\n\n\nLast year was his fifth year as a co-instructor of the course, Friedl said.\n\n\n\n\"He seems to be a highly regarded \u00a3instructor at the academy. He consistently received high praise from students,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGates told CNN Wednesday that although charges had been dropped, he will keep the issue alive.\n\n\n\n\"This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,\" Gates told CNN's Soledad O'Brien.\n\n\n\nGates said the Cambridge mayor had called him to apologize about the incident. Simmons, Cambridge's first black female mayor, confirmed to CNN that she apologized to Gates.\n\n\n\nGates said he'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer \"if he told the truth\" about what the director of Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were \"fabrications\" in the police report. iReport.com: Join the conversation on racial profiling\n\n\n\nCrowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, \"Why, because I'm a black man in America?\"\n\n\n\nThe report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification, but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police.\n\n\n\n\"While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,\" Crowley said, according to the report.\n\n\n\nGates was arrested for \"loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space\" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station.\n\n\n\nHe said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit.\n\n\n\nGates said that although the ordeal had upset him, \"I would do the same thing exactly again.\"",

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Ohio death row inmate who says he is too overweight to be executed took his plea to the Supreme Court on Friday.\n\n\n\nRichard Cooey, 41, and an accomplice were convicted of the 1986 murders of two college students.\n\n\n\nRichard Cooey is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday and has exhausted most of his state and federal appeals. Gov. Ted Strickland earlier Friday denied the 41-year-old prisoner's clemency petition. Cooey murdered two college students in 1986.\n\n\n\nThe justices were expected to decide whether he should receive a stay of execution, and whether to address the larger constitutional claims over when a convicted person is medically unfit for capital punishment.\n\n\n\nHis lawyers have argued that the inmate-- at 5-foot-7 and 267 pounds -- is \"morbidly obese,\" and has gained about 70 pounds since his incarceration at age 19. Prison food and confinement in his cell for 23 hours a day, limiting his opportunities for exercise, contributed to his weight problem, his legal team said in recent court filings.\n\n\n\nCooey also says regular medication he takes for migraines will weaken the effectiveness of an anesthetic used in the a three-drug cocktail administered during execution. He says his veins are weakened because of his health issues, and the lethal drugs would amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, one day before Cooey was scheduled to die, a judge stopped his execution on issues unrelated to his health claims.\n\n\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Cooey waited too long to raise the medical issues, saying he \"knew of and could have filed suit over vein access prior to July 2005.\"\n\n\n\nCooey and a then-17-year-old accomplice were convicted of the brutal murders of Wendy Offredo and Dawn McCreery, students at the University of Akron. The men had been tossing concrete slabs onto Interstate 77, and one of them struck Offredo's car.\n\n\n\nPretending to rescue the women, Cooey and Clinton Dickens took them to a remote field, according to prosecutors. There, the students were subjected to 3\u00bd hours of rape, torture, stabbings and fatal bludgeonings. Cooey had carved an \"X\" into the stomachs of both women, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\nEach man blamed the other for delivering the fatal blows, but both were convicted of murder. Dickens received a life sentence because of his age.\n\n\n\nCooey tried to escape from death row in 2005, when corrections officials said he constructed a ladder from magazines and bedsheets in an effort to scale the barrier around an outdoor recreation area.\n\n\n\nAt an August clemency hearing, Jon Offredo, brother of one of the victims, said, \"Our family has never gotten an apology from Richard Cooey. We've gotten blatant lies and excuses. Is an apology too much to ask? How could he commit such a heinous act and not feel regret?\"\n\n\n\nBut Cooey's lawyer, Dana Cole, said his client is sorry for his crimes.\n\n\n\nThe high court has not offered clear guidelines on what medical standards need to be met before an inmate is eligible for death. But in a case five years ago, the justices allowed inmates to at least make a claim that their specific physical or medical issues could be cause to block an execution.\n\n\n\nThe high court had sided with a convicted Alabama killer who claimed his veins were so damaged from years of drug abuse that executioners might have to cut deeply into his flesh to administer the deadly drugs.\n\n\n\nWriting for the unanimous court, then-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the court was not going to \"open the floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges,\" as Alabama feared. \"Our holding is extremely limited.\" That inmate is still on death row.\n\n\n\nRichard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a data-resource group that opposes capital punishment, said the Supreme Court indicated that \"how you're going to be executed is a civil rights matter, the same as if you were discriminated [against] on the basis of race or gender or something like that.\"\n\n\n\nA Washington state killer was given a reprieve in 1994 after claiming he was too obese to hang. Mitchell Rupe at one time was more than 425 pounds, but weight-loss surgery in prison had reduced that to 275 pounds over the years. Subsequent legal efforts to execute him failed. He died in prison two years ago from a long illness.\n\n\n\nThe Ohio case is Cooey v. Strickland.",
